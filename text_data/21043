   We Deserve

   When listing all the ways humanity is going to ruin the future, one
   that doesn’t often come up is the sun being blocked out by a horde of
   drone advertising blimps. But that hasn’t stopped one Swiss firm from
   working hard to make it a reality.

   Skye Aero is a project to build 10-foot helium-filled balloons, with
   small propellers attached to give better control than your average
   blimp. The benefits are a much bigger aircraft—useful when you want to
   advertise to people—and one that won’t crash the second it loses power,
   or bumps into anyone.

   It’s not a totally new design—British band Muse have been using a fleet
   of similar drones on their most recent tour—but Swiss firm Aerotain’s
   design stands out, due to its soul-sucking practicality. The company
   thinks Aerotain will be a perfect, audience-engaging advertising
   platform, which is probably true, but a little too consumerist to get
   excited about.

   Moving away from its role as a replacement for the Goodyear Blimp,
   lighter-than-air drones are an interesting and underutilized concept.
   Provided they’re not filled with hydrogen, they offer increased safety
   for flying over crowds, and a much greater payload than traditional
   quadcopters. Hopefully, someone will find a better application for them
   than giant floating billboards.

   Suit Has Lockheed Martin DNA

   As much as the Olympics are a test of humanity's physical capabilities,
   these days the events are also an opportunity for equipment makers to
   show off their latest technologies designed to enhance an athlete's
   performance. And it's fitting that Under Armour's new speedskating
   suit—which the company claims is the fastest in the world—is called the
   Mach 39, since it was developed with the help of Lockheed Martin.

   As the photo of this ridiculously muscled athlete shows, winning gold
   at the Olympics is still dependent on every competitor's performance.
   But when it comes to speedskating, the US Olympic team will have an
   extra edge with the Mach 39, which underwent 300 hours of wind tunnel
   testing and was analyzed using computational fluid dynamics at Lockheed
   Martin to determine the optimal aerodynamic design.

   Not only will its highly engineered molded shape help skaters slice
   through the air, a repositioned zipper that bypasses the throat will
   make the suit more comfortable to wear. And in addition to
   strategically placed vents that help keep the athlete cool, a material
   the company calls ArmourGlide will help drastically reduce friction in
   the thigh area—which is very important in a competition, even if it
   looks like there's am awkward spotlight pointed at the athletes'
   crotches. [Under Armour]

This Is How to Find the Spiders That Are Staring At You in the Dark

   Illustration for article titled This Is How to Find the Spiders That
   Are Staring At You in the Dark

   Have you ever looked out into your backyard at night and wondered how
   many spiders are lurking out there? If you have a flashlight, you can
   spot them by the creepy green glow of their eyes.

   Most spiders have eight eyes. In some species — mostly those that hunt
   for their prey, like wolf spiders — four of those eyes have a
   iridescent layer behind their retinas, called a tapetum. It’s a common
   structure in the animal world, especially in animals that have evolved
   to hunt or forage at night, like cats, dogs, deer, lemurs, raccoon, and
   even some bird species.

   When light shines into the eye, it reflects off the tapetum and back
   onto the retina. More light hitting the retina means that the animal
   can get the most out of every photon, improving its ability to see in
   the dark. The reflected light also creates what’s called “eyeshine,”
   which is why cats’ eyes seem to glow in the dark.

   It’s also why you can see spiders’ eyes glowing bright green in the
   night, if you know how to look: light reflects off their tapeta, and
   they’re looking in your direction. Enjoy thinking about that.

Follow the Eyeshine

   I caught this one myself.

   The Boy Scouts have taught this trick for years; they call it “spider
   sniffing,” but professional biologists also use it to find and study
   spiders that hunt at night. Here’s how it works:

   Hold a flashlight level with your eyes. You’ll look a little silly
   doing this, but it means the light will reflect from the spiders’ eyes
   at an easier angle for you to spot. Sweep the light across the grass
   about 15 or 20 feet away. If you see a bright point of eerie green
   light, that’s your flashlight beam reflecting off a spider’s eyes. Feel
   free to walk over and check it out; you’ll probably be surprised at how
   bright the eyeshine from even a tiny spider can be.

   Advertisement

   In most of North America, you’ll probably find mostly wolf spiders,
   whose venom isn’t dangerous to humans, but you should still be careful.
   You may also see some red reflections out there in the dark; they’re
   probably June bugs or moths.

Looking at You?

   Are Staring At You in the Dark

   Hi, there! Image: Wikimedia Commons

   Spiders have eight eyes, but they don’t actually see that well. Wolf
   spiders have the second-best vision in the class Arachnida, after
   jumping spiders — but even jumping spiders see only about as well as
   cats. Although cats have excellent night vision, and they’re great at
   seeing even the slightest motion, their vision isn’t actually very
   sharp. The world looks brighter, but blurrier, to a cat or a jumping
   spider.

   The world looks even blurrier to a wolf spider. To find prey and dodge
   predators, they rely more on their ability to sense vibrations. That
   means, of course, that they still know exactly where you are.
   Especially the one on your shoulder.

   Humans live on land, but it’s the watery parts of the planet that
   dictate our fate. The frozen ice at the poles and in high mountains and
   the vast swath of ocean that covers nearly three-quarters of the planet
   mean this place is primarily earth in name only. The ice—dubbed the
   cryosphere by scientists—and the oceans…

   The Apple Watch is hands-down the best smartwatch out there. There, I
   said it. It’s a boring conclusion that is nevertheless the cold, hard
   truth. You can prefer a round face, or a different operating system.
   You can scream about better battery life and third-party watch faces
   until you die, purple-faced from asphyxiation. The Series 5 still
   reigns king. That’s true even if this time around, most of the updates
   are small tweaks rather than game-changers.

   Now that’s out of the way, if you have an Apple Watch already, there’s
   not a huge reason to upgrade unless yours is on the verge of dying. (Or
   if you feel like burning your money in a bonfire.) I say this because
   you can get most of what makes the Series 5 great by downloading
   WatchOS 6. That includes new features like women’s health tracking,
   noise monitoring, the tip calculator, the new on-wrist App Store,
   compass, and some updates to Siri—who despite everything, is still the
   worst of the three major voice assistants.

   The most compelling reason to shell out $400 or more for a Series 5
   would be if you want an always-on display. It’s not a new feature in
   the smartwatch world, nor is it unique to Apple. Plenty of Android
   watches introduced always-on display modes ages ago, and Fitbit just
   did it with the Versa 2. That said, the Series 5's always-on display
   does it better.

   Part of that is the low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO)
   screen. In simple terms, the screen can refresh at a rate that varies
   from 1Hz to 60Hz. To ensure that the always-on display doesn’t eat into
   battery life, Apple’s also tweaked its sensors to be more
   power-efficient, and watch faces have a “dimmer” mode when you’re not
   looking directly at the watch. For example, the new Meridian face
   switches from white to black when you’re not looking at it and
   eliminates the animation for the second hand. I should note, however,
   the always-on display watch faces aren’t a monochrome bore like it is
   with the Versa 2. You still get to view complications, and there’s
   still a flash of color depending on the watch face.

   The other part is Apple’s keenly aware that everybody’s a busybody.
   True story, seeing an errant message pop up on an Apple Watch was how a
   friend of mine caught a cheating significant other. While you can still
   get notifications and view complications, Apple also includes a “Hide
   Sensitive Complications” option in the watch’s settings. When your
   wrist is down, it’ll hide notifications you don’t want other people
   possibly seeing out the corner of their eye—things like emails,
   messages, heart rate and calendar events. It’s a small touch for sure,
   but one that might matter depending on your job or situation.
   Each watch face has an “alternate” version for the always-on display.

   If you’re worried the always-on display could muck up a night at the
   movies or your sleep, don’t. Apple told me another change with the
   Series 5 is the ambient light sensor. It too is always on now. Meaning,
   if you’re lying in bed trying to sleep, it can tell the lights are off
   and will dim accordingly. I tried it. It works, and there’s always
   theater mode if you want to play it safe.

   Personally, I found the always-on display to be neat but not necessary
   in my day-to-day. I chalk it up to years of reviewing smartwatches—the
   wrist flick is just second nature now. That said, I can see how this
   might be good for new smartwatch owners accustomed to their analog
   watches. The thing I found it most useful for was running. Not because
   it was great in direct sunlight—it’s not—or for glancing at my stats
   from my peripheral vision. (I don’t know how you run, but it’s awkward
   trying to look at your watch without raising your wrist.) It’s useful
   because the display is already on, meaning there’s no lag when you
   flick your wrist to wake the watch up. The stats just get brighter and
   easier to see. It always takes me out of the zone when I have to whip
   my arm up multiple times to check my pace, so this was a welcome
   change.

   As for battery life, you still have to charge every day, but you don’t
   have to pack a charger in your bag. The always-on display does guzzle
   more battery compared to previous models, but not in a noticeable way.
   On a day where I picked the watch up off the charger at 8 am, walked
   the entirety of the Bronx Zoo, and got home around midnight, the Apple
   Watch still had about 30 percent battery left. Of course, how much you
   get off one charge will depend on how heavily you use LTE, Bluetooth,
   and GPS. For reference, a 30-minute GPS run with the always-on display
   zapped about 20 percent of my battery, but by bedtime, I still had 36
   percent left. I didn’t get anywhere near the 36-ish hours I got with
   the Series 4, but as long as you’re okay charging every night you’ll be
   fine.

   The always-on display doesn’t do well in direct sunlight. But because
   it’s always on, there’s no lag in waking up the watch while you’re
   mid-exercise.

   The other hardware upgrade allows the Apple Watch to make emergency
   calls in other countries. Data will still depend on what deals Apple
   has with international carriers, but the idea is if you have a bad
   fall, the watch can call emergency services for you. You will most
   likely never need this feature, but hey, it’s there.

   Advertisement

   That’s really it. Accuracy-wise, the Series 5 delivered the same
   results as the Series 4 during a 2.44-mile GPS run. That’s to say it
   slightly underreported distance (2.39 miles) compared to my phone’s
   GPS, while heart rate was well within 5 beats per minute of a Polar H10
   chest strap. So again, unless you absolutely must have that LTPO screen
   or fancier titanium or ceramic materials, upgrading isn’t worth it. I
   downloaded WatchOS 6 to my Series 4, and it’s fine. You might
   experience some minor lag with an older model—like the Series 2—but a
   millisecond or two of latency isn’t going to kill you. You also might
   notice worse battery life with certain apps from WatchOS 6, but before
   you run to the Apple Store, do yourself a favor and download the update
   and sit with it for a week. If the performance really is unbearable,
   the Series 5 isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.

   As for WatchOS 6 and iOS 13's health updates, they’re solid but more
   passively iterative than mind-blowing. The on-wrist App Store is long
   overdue, but like all wrist-based stores, limiting. Browsing for apps
   is hard on a small screen, even with a dedicated Featured apps
   section—but that’s not a problem unique to Apple. Downloads are easy,
   but some will require your phone nearby. The Compass app will probably
   appeal to hikers or the perpetually lost, but it’s not the most
   exciting feature to write home about.

   Noise monitoring works, but its utility is more long-term. For
   instance, most people will know when they’re in a loud environment so a
   notification telling you “Hey, you’re in a loud place right now” is
   kind of pointless. While testing, I walked past a blaring ambulance
   that registered 105 decibels on my watch. I knew it was loud and bad
   for my ears, so the accompanying notification was redundant. More
   interesting is going into the Health app to look at your noise exposure
   level over the course of a week or month. A week in New York City, for
   example, netted me an average noise exposure level of about 75 decibels
   for a duration of 76 hours and 48 minutes. This is probably more useful
   for people whose jobs may result in hearing loss, like musicians. For
   me, it’s something I can tuck in my small talk arsenal for the next
   time someone asks me what I do for a living.

   Cycles Tracking, however, is a welcome change. I’ve only spent about a
   week or so with it, but I’m tempted to use it as my main period
   tracking app. It’s got a clean design and logging from my wrist is
   easier than on other smartwatches. It’s also a nice touch that you can
   opt in or out of fertility or sexual activity logging, as well as
   choose how prominently that information is displayed in the Health app
   itself. Both are sensitive bits of information that despite Apple’s
   privacy promises, are things women might want to keep to themselves or
   at least away from nosy subway riders. Apple also gets points for
   including text discouraging users from relying on its fertility window
   predictions for contraception—a low bar, but one that some women’s
   health apps fail to clear. My one quibble is like so many period apps
   out there, there’s no option to log certain contraceptive options, such
   as the NuvaRing or birth control pills.
   Cycles Tracking is one of the easiest apps for logging from your wrist.

   Likewise, the new Health app is a marked improvement. Navigating
   between menus takes some getting used to, but the new Highlights
   section is useful context. It is weirdly motivating to see that say, by
   10:30am, I am 3,000 steps behind my daily average. Or that I’m
   averaging fewer exercise minutes this month than last month (23 minutes
   a day in September, versus 25 minutes a day in August). It’s definitely
   not as advanced as the companion apps for a Polar or Garmin smartwatch,
   but it’s better at tracking your trends over time than Fitbit.

   Small improvements are still improvements. The Series 5 might not
   represent a major shift in the same way the Series 4 did, with its
   bigger screen and ECG capabilities, but it is the more comprehensive
   watch. And given the lack of serious competition, it’s not like Apple
   needs to rush with how many features it adds each year. It’s free to
   coast on incremental improvements for the foreseeable future because
   right now, every other smartwatch maker is still playing catch up in
   quality and breadth of features. Except for battery life. But if all I
   can harp on is battery life—a thing most Apple Watch users seem to be
   ambivalent about anyway—then what is there really to complain about?

Flying Drone Billboards Are the Future We Deserve

   We Deserve

   When listing all the ways humanity is going to ruin the future, one
   that doesn’t often come up is the sun being blocked out by a horde of
   drone advertising blimps. But that hasn’t stopped one Swiss firm from
   working hard to make it a reality.

   Skye Aero is a project to build 10-foot helium-filled balloons, with
   small propellers attached to give better control than your average
   blimp. The benefits are a much bigger aircraft—useful when you want to
   advertise to people—and one that won’t crash the second it loses power,
   or bumps into anyone.

   It’s not a totally new design—British band Muse have been using a fleet
   of similar drones on their most recent tour—but Swiss firm Aerotain’s
   design stands out, due to its soul-sucking practicality. The company
   thinks Aerotain will be a perfect, audience-engaging advertising
   platform, which is probably true, but a little too consumerist to get
   excited about.

   Advertisement

   Moving away from its role as a replacement for the Goodyear Blimp,
   lighter-than-air drones are an interesting and underutilized concept.
   Provided they’re not filled with hydrogen, they offer increased safety
   for flying over crowds, and a much greater payload than traditional
   quadcopters. Hopefully, someone will find a better application for them
   than giant floating billboards.

   As much as the Olympics are a test of humanity's physical capabilities,
   these days the events are also an opportunity for equipment makers to
   show off their latest technologies designed to enhance an athlete's
   performance. And it's fitting that Under Armour's new speedskating
   suit—which the company claims is the fastest in the world—is called the
   Mach 39, since it was developed with the help of Lockheed Martin.

   As the photo of this ridiculously muscled athlete shows, winning gold
   at the Olympics is still dependent on every competitor's performance.
   But when it comes to speedskating, the US Olympic team will have an
   extra edge with the Mach 39, which underwent 300 hours of wind tunnel
   testing and was analyzed using computational fluid dynamics at Lockheed
   Martin to determine the optimal aerodynamic design.

   Not only will its highly engineered molded shape help skaters slice
   through the air, a repositioned zipper that bypasses the throat will
   make the suit more comfortable to wear. And in addition to
   strategically placed vents that help keep the athlete cool, a material
   the company calls ArmourGlide will help drastically reduce friction in
   the thigh area—which is very important in a competition, even if it
   looks like there's am awkward spotlight pointed at the athletes'
   crotches. [Under Armour]

   Illustration for article titled This Is How to Find the Spiders That
   Are Staring At You in the Dark

   Have you ever looked out into your backyard at night and wondered how
   many spiders are lurking out there? If you have a flashlight, you can
   spot them by the creepy green glow of their eyes.

   Most spiders have eight eyes. In some species — mostly those that hunt
   for their prey, like wolf spiders — four of those eyes have a
   iridescent layer behind their retinas, called a tapetum. It’s a common
   structure in the animal world, especially in animals that have evolved
   to hunt or forage at night, like cats, dogs, deer, lemurs, raccoon, and
   even some bird species.

   When light shines into the eye, it reflects off the tapetum and back
   onto the retina. More light hitting the retina means that the animal
   can get the most out of every photon, improving its ability to see in
   the dark. The reflected light also creates what’s called “eyeshine,”
   which is why cats’ eyes seem to glow in the dark.

   It’s also why you can see spiders’ eyes glowing bright green in the
   night, if you know how to look: light reflects off their tapeta, and
   they’re looking in your direction. Enjoy thinking about that.

Follow the Eyeshine

   I caught this one myself.

   The Boy Scouts have taught this trick for years; they call it “spider
   sniffing,” but professional biologists also use it to find and study
   spiders that hunt at night. Here’s how it works:

   Hold a flashlight level with your eyes. You’ll look a little silly
   doing this, but it means the light will reflect from the spiders’ eyes
   at an easier angle for you to spot. Sweep the light across the grass
   about 15 or 20 feet away. If you see a bright point of eerie green
   light, that’s your flashlight beam reflecting off a spider’s eyes. Feel
   free to walk over and check it out; you’ll probably be surprised at how
   bright the eyeshine from even a tiny spider can be.

   In most of North America, you’ll probably find mostly wolf spiders,
   whose venom isn’t dangerous to humans, but you should still be careful.
   You may also see some red reflections out there in the dark; they’re
   probably June bugs or moths.

Looking at You?

   Hi, there! Image: Wikimedia Commons

   Spiders have eight eyes, but they don’t actually see that well. Wolf
   spiders have the second-best vision in the class Arachnida, after
   jumping spiders — but even jumping spiders see only about as well as
   cats. Although cats have excellent night vision, and they’re great at
   seeing even the slightest motion, their vision isn’t actually very
   sharp. The world looks brighter, but blurrier, to a cat or a jumping
   spider.

   The world looks even blurrier to a wolf spider. To find prey and dodge
   predators, they rely more on their ability to sense vibrations. That
   means, of course, that they still know exactly where you are.
   Especially the one on your shoulder.

   The Apple Watch is hands-down the best smartwatch out there. There, I
   said it. It’s a boring conclusion that is nevertheless the cold, hard
   truth. You can prefer a round face, or a different operating system.
   You can scream about better battery life and third-party watch faces
   until you die, purple-faced from asphyxiation. The Series 5 still
   reigns king. That’s true even if this time around, most of the updates
   are small tweaks rather than game-changers.

   Advertisement

   Now that’s out of the way, if you have an Apple Watch already, there’s
   not a huge reason to upgrade unless yours is on the verge of dying. (Or
   if you feel like burning your money in a bonfire.) I say this because
   you can get most of what makes the Series 5 great by downloading
   WatchOS 6. That includes new features like women’s health tracking,
   noise monitoring, the tip calculator, the new on-wrist App Store,
   compass, and some updates to Siri—who despite everything, is still the
   worst of the three major voice assistants.

   The most compelling reason to shell out $400 or more for a Series 5
   would be if you want an always-on display. It’s not a new feature in
   the smartwatch world, nor is it unique to Apple. Plenty of Android
   watches introduced always-on display modes ages ago, and Fitbit just
   did it with the Versa 2. That said, the Series 5's always-on display
   does it better.

   Part of that is the low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO)
   screen. In simple terms, the screen can refresh at a rate that varies
   from 1Hz to 60Hz. To ensure that the always-on display doesn’t eat into
   battery life, Apple’s also tweaked its sensors to be more
   power-efficient, and watch faces have a “dimmer” mode when you’re not
   looking directly at the watch. For example, the new Meridian face
   switches from white to black when you’re not looking at it and
   eliminates the animation for the second hand. I should note, however,
   the always-on display watch faces aren’t a monochrome bore like it is
   with the Versa 2. You still get to view complications, and there’s
   still a flash of color depending on the watch face.

Looking For a Smartwatch or Fitness Tracker? These Are the Best You Can Buy

   Smartwatches, fitness trackers, and even jewelry—if it’s technology you
   can wear, we’ve reviewed…

   The other part is Apple’s keenly aware that everybody’s a busybody.
   True story, seeing an errant message pop up on an Apple Watch was how a
   friend of mine caught a cheating significant other. While you can still
   get notifications and view complications, Apple also includes a “Hide
   Sensitive Complications” option in the watch’s settings. When your
   wrist is down, it’ll hide notifications you don’t want other people
   possibly seeing out the corner of their eye—things like emails,
   messages, heart rate and calendar events. It’s a small touch for sure,
   but one that might matter depending on your job or situation.

   If you’re worried the always-on display could muck up a night at the
   movies or your sleep, don’t. Apple told me another change with the
   Series 5 is the ambient light sensor. It too is always on now. Meaning,
   if you’re lying in bed trying to sleep, it can tell the lights are off
   and will dim accordingly. I tried it. It works, and there’s always
   theater mode if you want to play it safe.

   Personally, I found the always-on display to be neat but not necessary
   in my day-to-day. I chalk it up to years of reviewing smartwatches—the
   wrist flick is just second nature now. That said, I can see how this
   might be good for new smartwatch owners accustomed to their analog
   watches. The thing I found it most useful for was running. Not because
   it was great in direct sunlight—it’s not—or for glancing at my stats
   from my peripheral vision. (I don’t know how you run, but it’s awkward
   trying to look at your watch without raising your wrist.) It’s useful
   because the display is already on, meaning there’s no lag when you
   flick your wrist to wake the watch up. The stats just get brighter and
   easier to see. It always takes me out of the zone when I have to whip
   my arm up multiple times to check my pace, so this was a welcome
   change.

   As for battery life, you still have to charge every day, but you don’t
   have to pack a charger in your bag. The always-on display does guzzle
   more battery compared to previous models, but not in a noticeable way.
   On a day where I picked the watch up off the charger at 8 am, walked
   the entirety of the Bronx Zoo, and got home around midnight, the Apple
   Watch still had about 30 percent battery left. Of course, how much you
   get off one charge will depend on how heavily you use LTE, Bluetooth,
   and GPS. For reference, a 30-minute GPS run with the always-on display
   zapped about 20 percent of my battery, but by bedtime, I still had 36
   percent left. I didn’t get anywhere near the 36-ish hours I got with
   the Series 4, but as long as you’re okay charging every night you’ll be
   fine.

   The always-on display doesn’t do well in direct sunlight. But because
   it’s always on, there’s no lag in waking up the watch while you’re
   mid-exercise.

   The other hardware upgrade allows the Apple Watch to make emergency
   calls in other countries. Data will still depend on what deals Apple
   has with international carriers, but the idea is if you have a bad
   fall, the watch can call emergency services for you. You will most
   likely never need this feature, but hey, it’s there.

   Advertisement

   That’s really it. Accuracy-wise, the Series 5 delivered the same
   results as the Series 4 during a 2.44-mile GPS run. That’s to say it
   slightly underreported distance (2.39 miles) compared to my phone’s
   GPS, while heart rate was well within 5 beats per minute of a Polar H10
   chest strap. So again, unless you absolutely must have that LTPO screen
   or fancier titanium or ceramic materials, upgrading isn’t worth it. I
   downloaded WatchOS 6 to my Series 4, and it’s fine. You might
   experience some minor lag with an older model—like the Series 2—but a
   millisecond or two of latency isn’t going to kill you. You also might
   notice worse battery life with certain apps from WatchOS 6, but before
   you run to the Apple Store, do yourself a favor and download the update
   and sit with it for a week. If the performance really is unbearable,
   the Series 5 isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.

   As for WatchOS 6 and iOS 13's health updates, they’re solid but more
   passively iterative than mind-blowing. The on-wrist App Store is long
   overdue, but like all wrist-based stores, limiting. Browsing for apps
   is hard on a small screen, even with a dedicated Featured apps
   section—but that’s not a problem unique to Apple. Downloads are easy,
   but some will require your phone nearby. The Compass app will probably
   appeal to hikers or the perpetually lost, but it’s not the most
   exciting feature to write home about.

   Noise monitoring works, but its utility is more long-term. For
   instance, most people will know when they’re in a loud environment so a
   notification telling you “Hey, you’re in a loud place right now” is
   kind of pointless. While testing, I walked past a blaring ambulance
   that registered 105 decibels on my watch. I knew it was loud and bad
   for my ears, so the accompanying notification was redundant. More
   interesting is going into the Health app to look at your noise exposure
   level over the course of a week or month. A week in New York City, for
   example, netted me an average noise exposure level of about 75 decibels
   for a duration of 76 hours and 48 minutes. This is probably more useful
   for people whose jobs may result in hearing loss, like musicians. For
   me, it’s something I can tuck in my small talk arsenal for the next
   time someone asks me what I do for a living.

   Cycles Tracking, however, is a welcome change. I’ve only spent about a
   week or so with it, but I’m tempted to use it as my main period
   tracking app. It’s got a clean design and logging from my wrist is
   easier than on other smartwatches. It’s also a nice touch that you can
   opt in or out of fertility or sexual activity logging, as well as
   choose how prominently that information is displayed in the Health app
   itself. Both are sensitive bits of information that despite Apple’s
   privacy promises, are things women might want to keep to themselves or
   at least away from nosy subway riders. Apple also gets points for
   including text discouraging users from relying on its fertility window
   predictions for contraception—a low bar, but one that some women’s
   health apps fail to clear. My one quibble is like so many period apps
   out there, there’s no option to log certain contraceptive options, such
   as the NuvaRing or birth control pills.
   Cycles Tracking is one of the easiest apps for logging from your wrist.

   Likewise, the new Health app is a marked improvement. Navigating
   between menus takes some getting used to, but the new Highlights
   section is useful context. It is weirdly motivating to see that say, by
   10:30am, I am 3,000 steps behind my daily average. Or that I’m
   averaging fewer exercise minutes this month than last month (23 minutes
   a day in September, versus 25 minutes a day in August). It’s definitely
   not as advanced as the companion apps for a Polar or Garmin smartwatch,
   but it’s better at tracking your trends over time than Fitbit.

   Small improvements are still improvements. The Series 5 might not
   represent a major shift in the same way the Series 4 did, with its
   bigger screen and ECG capabilities, but it is the more comprehensive
   watch. And given the lack of serious competition, it’s not like Apple
   needs to rush with how many features it adds each year. It’s free to
   coast on incremental improvements for the foreseeable future because
   right now, every other smartwatch maker is still playing catch up in
   quality and breadth of features. Except for battery life. But if all I
   can harp on is battery life—a thing most Apple Watch users seem to be
   ambivalent about anyway—then what is there really to complain about?

     * Main hardware updates are the LTPO screen, which enables its
       always-on display, and emergency cellular calling worldwide.
     * iOS 13 and WatchOS 6 improve health tracking. iOS 13 gives you a
       revamped Health app, while WatchOS 6 adds noise monitoring, women’s
       health, tip calculator, a compass, and on-wrist App Store.
     * Battery life, even with the always-on display, should last you
       through the day but expect to charge every night.
     * It’s the best smartwatch fam, but you don’t need to upgrade if you

   Goose Game

   Untitled Goose Game effectively ended for me when I found the boy who
   would run away if you honked at him. I didn’t need to achieve any more
   goals. I had reached peak goose.

   The game was released last Friday on PC and Switch. I rarely play games
   and I was not good at this one. But as a birdwatcher (or more
   accurately, a birder), I was absolutely thrilled at the chance of
   controlling a bird who does bird things. I love being the goose.

   Advertisement

   I also like learning about birds and going outside to identify birds
   and talking about birds with other birders. I cherish this hobby and am
   somewhat obsessive about it because it’s the only escape I’ve found
   from 21st century-induced stress.

   Video games typically stress me out because I’m bad at nearly all of
   them and I don’t like being bad at things. But when I heard there was a
   game where I could simply be a goose, I knew I had to play. I could be
   good at being a goose.

   Untitled Goose Game from House House was the subject of considerable
   hype prior to its release, for good reason: You’re a cantankerous goose
   and it’s your job to sneak around and manipulate the environment in
   order to ruin the non-player characters’ days. It’s among the first
   video games I can think of that has received considerable attention
   across my own social media circles, on which I engage with mostly
   bird-related content.

   But first, I had to figure out what kind of goose I was. There aren’t a
   lot of large all-white geese with pink bills. I figured it was either
   the North American Snow Goose or the domesticated form of the Greylag
   Goose. The shape of the animal and its particular association with
   humans made it clear I would be piloting the latter. The game doesn’t
   have many other natural features, but I was happy to see cattails on
   the side of the pond.

   I booted up the game, learned to navigate, pick up things, and honk,
   and I was off to be a goose.

   Advertisement

   To be honest, I was about as bad at this game as I am at every other
   game, which was frustrating. The first few tasks—stealing keys from the
   groundskeeper or getting him wet—were easy enough. But after around
   thirty minutes of shuffling things around, I couldn’t figure out how to
   get the groundskeeper to put on his sun hat. Plus, the awkward
   controls—specifically the running mechanism (it’s harder to turn if
   you’re running)—meant that piloting my feathered form took more effort
   than I was willing to put into the game. I decided that I’d use a
   walkthrough whenever I got stuck and simply focus on manifesting my
   gooseness.

   And the game definitely delivered on that front. The waddling, honking,
   and flapping all seemed properly goose-like to me. I don’t have a lot
   of experience with greylag geese but from my experience with North
   America’s Canada geese, I would say that yes, geese (especially feral
   geese) can be territorial and fearless animals. I have been hissed and
   honked at by them and even attacked for getting too close. I felt the
   game shined most during moments when I didn’t have to hide my
   goosehood, when the non-player characters noticed me, feared me, and
   even applauded me.

   But geese, even domestic geese, do more than annoy humans. They’re
   monogamous animals that start families, they must survive deadly
   threats, and wild geese are often migrants. These are all fine avenues
   for Untitled Goose Game 2 to explore.

   Other people can tell you whether the game was actually good or not.
   But me, I was just happy that I got to be a goose this weekend.

Apple's Call-Blocking Feature May Be a Little Too Good

   Be a Little Too Good
   Photo: Alex Cranz (Gizmodo)

   Apple’s iOS 13 release is crammed with features we’ve been looking
   forward to getting our hands on for months—I’m looking at you, Arcade
   and system-wide Dark Mode—but one of the tools that this blogger was
   most excited for was Apple’s spam-fighting feature to silence those
   infuriating robocalls driving us all mad. And if you’re looking to free
   yourself from the hell of incessant, unwanted calls from unknown
   numbers, this is absolutely the feature for you. That said, you should
   also be aware of some problems you might bump into with the tool
   enabled.

   To turn the feature on, navigate to Settings and then Phone, where
   you’ll find the Silence Uknown Callers option. With this feature turned
   on, calls from unknown numbers will be forwarded straight to voicemail
   and listed in Recents. (Missed calls will still leave push
   notifications, and another notification will appear if a voicemail was
   left.) In order to help navigate which calls should be sent to
   voicemail and which ones you may not have saved but might want to
   receive, Apple says the feature silences all unknown calls except for
   those a user has previously called, numbers saved in Contacts, and
   those that Siri suggests from Mail and Messages.

   Be a Little Too Good
   Screenshot: Gizmodo

   This is, to be sure, a fantastic feature if you’re constantly up
   against a tidal wave of calls from unknown numbers. It also might make
   it easier to claim that you missed a call if, say, you need an excuse
   for failing to return one. (Oops!) But because the filter silences all
   unknown callers, having the feature enabled means you could also miss
   an important call from work or your doctor’s office, assuming those
   numbers aren’t saved in your phone. I recently missed a call from my
   significant other, for example, who called from an unsaved office
   phone.

   There also appear to be some bugs Apple has yet to work out (though,
   arguably, that’s to be expected with a v1 rollout of a new OS). The
   filter shouldn’t silence incoming text messages, but members of the
   Gizmodo staff seemed to run into some glitches. I, as well as Senior
   Reviews Editor Alex Cranz, had issues with push notifications for text
   messages from unknown numbers.

   Both of us placed delivery orders and were mortified to learn that we
   were not being notified of texts or calls coming through from our
   couriers, leaving those delivery workers in the lurch when they needed
   to reach us. Alex noted her delivery person tried contacting her from
   their personal phone number, and the calls were immediately routed to
   voicemail.

   Repeated calls are ignored.

   The company through which my delivery was placed, Shipt, says it masks
   numbers to protect the security of both its shoppers and customers.
   This suggests both private numbers and those regularly used by services
   like Shipt or FreshDirect are subject to the rerouting.

   Advertisement

   The feature also appeared to be buggy for text messages to and from
   other members of our team. When I tried to text Senior Editor Adam
   Clark Estes, he got a notification on his laptop but not his phone.
   When Alex tried to text me from her iPhone, and vice versa, no
   notification populated on the home screen—at first. Several
   back-and-forth texts later, iOS not only began surfacing notifications
   on the home screen but also suggested who the text was from (i.e.
   “Maybe: Alex Cranz”).

   Apple declined to comment.

   All in all, it’s a good and welcome feature given the present scourge
   of bots and spam calls. It’s not the only one though. Most carriers in
   the U.S. now have some kind of spam-blocking feature, which typically
   blocks numbers from known spammers and nothing else. Apple’s solution
   is a little more severe, but potentially useful if you’re harassed by
   the billions of spam calls placed to U.S. numbers every year.

   Advertisement

   We’d like to know whether you’ve enabled this feature and love it for
   batting away spam and robo-callers or whether you’ve found it buggy or
   troublesome. Have you hit any unforeseen snags with the filter turned
   on? Let us know down below!

   Clarification: After publication, a spokesperson for Shipt told Gizmodo
   by email that after looking into the issue, it hadn’t received any
   other reports of communication issues since iOS 13 went live. Still, if
   you have this feature enabled, it’s a good idea to keep an eye on your
   phone if you’re expecting a call from your delivery courier. Don’t be
   like us!
