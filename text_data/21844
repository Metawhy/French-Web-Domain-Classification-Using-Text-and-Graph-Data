Search VigLink’s product catalogue of over 350 million products!

   October 18, 2016

   At VigLink, we’re always trying to help our publishers by providing
   them with best-in-class tools that allow them to both earn incremental
   revenue and also gain deeper insight into their monetization strategy
   and audience. Did you know that VigLink boasts a product catalog of
   over 350 million products! Now, you can search that product catalog at
   scale. We’re very excited to release a flexible Product Search API
   which allows you to search  based on a keyword or phrase and quickly
   retrieve offers while maintaining a high degree of relevancy. The API’s
   response will include the following parameters:
    1. Product title
    2. Advertiser name
    3. Brand
    4. Normalized Product Category, e.g., “Fashion > Shoes”
    5. Advertiser country
    6. UPC
    7. Price
    8. Image URL
    9. Anywhere (monetized) URL

   The Product API can be used for a number of applications including
   populating a complete storefront, inserting exact products into your
   posts or pages, creating comparison shopping boxes, and more! We’ll
   also be using this API to power some of the products launching soon
   that we think you’ll be really excited about. To learn more and see the
   full API documentation go here.

Search VigLink’s product catalogue of over 350 million products!

   October 18, 2016

   At VigLink, we’re always trying to help our publishers by providing
   them with best-in-class tools that allow them to both earn incremental
   revenue and also gain deeper insight into their monetization strategy
   and audience. Did you know that VigLink boasts a product catalog of
   over 350 million products! Now, you can search that product catalog at
   scale. We’re very excited to release a flexible Product Search API
   which allows you to search  based on a keyword or phrase and quickly
   retrieve offers while maintaining a high degree of relevancy. The API’s
   response will include the following parameters:
    1. Product title
    2. Advertiser name
    3. Brand
    4. Normalized Product Category, e.g., “Fashion > Shoes”
    5. Advertiser country
    6. UPC
    7. Price
    8. Image URL
    9. Anywhere (monetized) URL

   The Product API can be used for a number of applications including
   populating a complete storefront, inserting exact products into your
   posts or pages, creating comparison shopping boxes, and more! We’ll
   also be using this API to power some of the products launching soon
   that we think you’ll be really excited about. To learn more and see the
   full API documentation go here.
