10 Tips to Help You Spring Clean Your Craft Room

   10 tips to help you spring clean craft space via Spark and Chemistry
   title2

   It’s Spring cleaning tiimmmee! (I said that in my Oprah voice, lol) And
   that means, yes, you have to tackle your craft room – or craft space,
   craft closet, craft garage, small cabinet under the kitchen counter
   where you keep your supplies – pretty much, anywhere you do your
   crafting. Even if you just want the get the sense of deep cleaning
   house spring cleaning is a great yearly habit you should develop to
   purge your old supplies and make room for the new stuff.

   If you’re dreading it, don’t!

   In this post, I’ll give you some helpful tips on how to tackle cleaning
   and decluttering one of the rooms in your home that gives you life- the
   room that makes you feel creative and inspired. And hopefully by the
   end of this list you feel fired up all over again to MAKE MORE STUFF.

Let’s go!

   10 tips to help you spring clean craft space Spark and Chemistry blog

Tip #1: Make a Spring or Summer project with supplies that have been sitting
for a while.

   It’s Spring, and you’ll definitely want to decorate if you haven’t
   started already. Using the supplies you currently have, but haven’t
   been getting much use, make a few Spring crafts to give away for Easter
   or simply to decorate your home – whether that’s a wreath, mantle
   display or tablescape idea. Try not to buy anything new for this- the
   key is to declutter. This will quickly help you use some of those
   excess supplies.

Tip #2: Sell or give completed projects away.

   As a diy/craft blogger, I have a lot of completed projects that are
   just sitting on my shelves – not getting any use. If you’re like me,
   pull some of those projects out, dust them off and give them away!
   There’s something that makes me happy when I see someone else enjoying
   a craft project I made. It’s just like giving away clothes you can’t
   fit. It benefits them and you at the same time. It might be a painful
   process at first. But you’re an amazing crafter, and if you really
   wanted another one, you could make it again, right? Another option is
   to sell your projects for a little cash – of course, to buy new
   supplies for this year! lol

Tip #3: Throw away dried paints, glues, primers, resins and mediums.

   Yeah, you know they’re there – tucked away in the back of your craft
   closet or drawer, collecting dust- drying out and becoming so solid
   they might as well be a paper weight, LOL!! Sometimes you can’t get the
   lid off because the glues have hardened inside the cap! Pull them out,
   open the top (if you can) and make sure these materials are not dried
   out. For the painters out there, check your paints often to make sure
   they are still useable. Doing this often will surely help you free up
   some space on your shelves.

Tip #4: Turn scrap paper into confetti.

   This is truly one of my favorites. We are a party blog, and confetti is
   our middle name. But we all have left over cardstock and patterned
   paper that was used for various projects. If you don’t have one, buy a
   paper cutting board or use scissors to create confetti from these scrap
   pieces of paper. Use your custom confetti as table decoration elements
   for parties, cards, gift wrap, or any festive craft project that comes
   to mind. You’ll be surprised at how many different types of confetti
   you can create with paper you were going to toss away.

   10 tips to help you spring clean craft space turn scrap paper into
   confetti

Tip #5: Upgrade where you can.

   It’s Spring – and it’s okay to want a fresh start for the year. Don’t
   hesitate to upgrade some of your storage as you continue to buy new
   items and expand your collection. And then when it gets too much, you
   can always look into using the service of removalists to help store
   your supplies in a self storage facility. You can then make space for
   more items around the home. Maybe there’s a new craft desk that you
   think would give you more surface space to work, or a shelving unit
   that’s a little bit bigger than what you currently have. Upgrading
   elements in your room not only makes you feel good, but it’s a
   motivator to want to start cleaning if you’ve been dreading it. I
   personally like to upgrade my storage containers to the same type so
   they look cohesive on my shelf. Perhaps some of your older craft
   supplies can get a face lift – a heavier duty hot glue gun, or a fresh
   sewing machine. Whatever it may be, be sure to buy supplies that are
   useful and will help you stay organized for the year.

     Still with me? Yes!!

Tip #6: Look through all of your boxes and label, label, label!

   Look through ALL of your boxes and label everything! It’s so easy to
   finish a project and throw all the supplies you used into an unlabeled,
   empty box. Try not to do that this year, if you do. I know I’m a little
   guilty of that- so maybe this step is just for me, lol. But if I so
   happen not to be the only one out there, have a place for everything as
   best you can. Go through all of your boxes and containers. Empty the
   contents, sort and relabel them so you can keep track and know where to
   find what you need. And you may find craft supplies you forgot you had!
   You don’t have to buy boxes if you don’t want to. Head to your local
   grocery store and ask for boxes, or search your home to find small,
   empty cardboard boxes for storage. Wrap them in pretty paper or
   decoupage scrap fabric on them for an easy face lift. This step will
   definitely save you time searching for things and will make crafting
   less stressful this year.

   go through boxes

Tip #7: Optimize your storage with your own DIY containers or dispensers.

   So we know you’re creative, right? Well, use some of your current craft
   supplies (don’t go out and buy more – I’m watching you lol) to craft
   your own diy containers or dispensers for more storage options. Try
   your hardest not to go buy more supplies, unless it’s absolutely
   necessary. Try creating shelving, washi tape dispensers, or use diy
   shoebox trays to help organize your small supplies. Put your creative
   thinking cap on, harass Pinterest lol, and create your own custom
   containers and storage units with supplies you have to clear space.

Tip #8: Buy mobile storage for quick, easy access to craft supplies.

   Mobile storage is the best, most convenient piece of furniture when
   you’re in the middle of crafting. I love not having to walk around the
   room just to grab the supplies I often use. Also, it keeps supplies off
   your work surface and in a contained place. The Raskog storage cart
   from Ikea is perfect for this purpose. It’s mobile, small, and comes in
   a few different colors to match any space. Sometimes it’s okay to get a
   little messy while crafting; and keeping your supplies on a cart gives
   you that flexibility They‘re also great if you don’t have a craft room,
   but work in your kitchen, office or living room and need to quickly
   wheel supplies in and out. And the best part, it’s affordable. Try it
   out!

Tip #9: Give craft room walls a face lift to keep you inspired to create.

   Sometimes just a light coat of new paint in a room can help you feel
   more inspired. Plain white walls can feel dull and unmotivating. A dark
   room may feel claustrophobic and heavy. If you have time on a weekend,
   try painting a light, calming color on your walls like a soft blue or
   green; not only give your craft room a new look, but also to visually
   keep you motivated. This is especially helpful for those of you who
   craft for your creative business. You need a space that keeps you
   artistically stimulated and excited to work! You’ll be surprised how
   you feel when you walk into the same space, but this time with a fresh
   coat of new paint.

Tip #10: Utilize unconventional storage places to keep your surfaces clear.

   It’s so easy to pile up and pile up supplies on your work surface. But
   your crafting surfaces should be used for just that – crafting! Try
   keeping you surfaces clear as much as possible. A clear surface helps
   clear your mind to create. When there’s a lot of clutter in front of
   you, it can be hard to focus. Use the mobile storage in tip #8 or
   utilize your walls as a way to store supplies so you have room in front
   of you to create. Build upward with wall shelving, or craft a peg board
   diy, utilize any closets to their max, and maximize hanging space
   behind your doors.

     Don’t overwhelm yourself. Put on some good music,

     and have fun with it!

   Whew! That was a lot, but hopefully these Spring cleaning tips were
   helpful to you. Add to this list anything that is specific to your
   space. I know for me, I need to go through my craft magazines and
   recycle ones that aren’t relevant to my niche anymore or are outdated.
   I also need to hang my gift wrapping paper for easy dispensing when
   Christmas comes around. Remember to clean your baseboards, dust behind
   boxes on your shelves and vacuum. Typically, the same tidiness you do
   with your other rooms carries over to your craft space. If you do your
   crafting at the dinner table then consider using vinyl table cloths to
   protect your table.

   It’s crucial to not get overwhelmed during this time. I promise, this
   process is refreshing and you’ll feel so much better when it’s
   complete. Just put on your favorite music and get to work! When you’re
   done, you can buy and collect brand new crafts and this time it will be
   in a newly renovated and clean, craft space.

DIY Easter Egg Vase Magnets

   Easter egg vase magnets spring craft

   Hey crafters! I thought I’d share this crazy easy Easter craft.  I know
   all of you have eggs in your fridge this month, so why not use some of
   them as part of your decorations.  These simple Easter egg magnets are
   a great addition to the kitchen decor.  Try this DIY now!

   For this DIY, you’ll need:
     * Eggs
     * Magnets
     * Hot glue and gun
     * Food coloring
     * Water
     * Bowl
     * Flowers

   DIY easter egg magnet vases

   Step 1:

   Dye your eggs.  This step is optional but it is a good way to add some
   color to your refrigerator.  If you already have a lot of items posted
   to your refrigerator currently, maybe keeping the eggs white or its
   natural brown color is a good idea.  I dye my eggs by adding a few
   drops of food coloring into water and letting the eggs sit in the dyed
   water for about 30 minutes.  Dry the eggs once they are completely dyed
   to your liking.

   Step 2:

   Using a knife or a sharp object, poke a small hole at the top of the
   egg and carefully begin peeling away the top portion of the egg into
   small pieces.  You could crack the egg on the side of a bowl or
   counter, but you risk removing more eggshell than necessary.  Peeling
   away pieces at the top of the egg gives you more control over how large
   that hole is.  Empty the yolk inside the egg and make a delicious
   omelette!

   Step 3:

   Rinse the egg out and let it dry.  Hot glue the small magnet on the
   side of the egg where you want the “back of it” to be.  Be sure to get
   strong magnets.  As we all know, eggs are delicate and having a weak
   magnet risks the egg from falling off the refrigerator and breaking.

   Step 4:

   Add your florals and water inside of the egg.  Use silk flowers if you
   want it to last a long time.  Display on your refrigerator or magnetic
   board and you’ll have a sweet touch of Spring to enjoy all season!

DIY Adult Easter Baskets | Easter and Spring Crafts

   DIY adult easter baskets

   Easter’s coming soon! I have to admit- I do get a little jealous of the
   kiddos who have a ton of yummy candy in their ginormous Easter baskets.
    But hey, why not make your own adult Easter baskets?  Just like any
   gift box, fill it with simple treats and goodies to give to your
   girlfriends to wish them a happy holiday.  No need to go crazy
   expensive here if you don’t want to, just be sure to treat them with
   anything that will make them smile.  I like to use smaller baskets, so
   I don’t get carried away with buying gifts; the great thing is that
   they come in all fun shapes, sizes and styles.

   For this DIY, you’ll need:
     * Gift Baskets
     * Party stuffing/fluff
     * Small gifts for women
     * Ribbon
     * Tags
     * Flowers

   DIY Adult Easter Baskets via spark and chemistry

   Step 1:

   Stuff your basket to the top with party box filler.  I like the pastel
   pink colors for filler because it contrasts with the straw-colored
   basket.  I like to fill these all the way to the top, so that the gifts
   sit upright, and out of the basket.

   Step 2:

   Begin filling your basket.  I chose small gifts- a notebook, pencil,
   jewelry tray, fun clothespins, a pocket mirror, and a small candle just
   to name a few.  These simple gift items were very inexpensive and are
   small enough to fit inside.  My girlfriends can also use these items in
   their every day life- at the office, on the go and I was sure to add a
   bit of chocolate to keep it extra sweet.  Sit the items upright and try
   to place the larger items at the back of the basket and the smaller
   items at the front.

   Step 3:

   Once you have all your gift items set, add the flowers.  I bunched
   together a small bouquet of silk flowers and added them to the back of
   the basket.

   Step 4:

   Add a gift tag and any other final embellishments on the handle.

   Step 5:

   If you choose, cover the basket with clear cellophane wrapping.  I like
   to keep the basket open- since the basket is so small.

   The fun part about this Easter basket craft is making the basket
   colorful and unique for the person receiving it.  You can even add some
   color to the basket itself with paint or glitter.  Ribbons are great
   embellishments and I’ve even added a few craft keys to give it more
   flair.  There’s never too much.  Make it fun and personalize it for
   your loved ones!
