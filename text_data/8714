   Preternaturally prolific X-Men writer Chris Claremont, who made us all
   rethink superheroes with his Dark Phoenix arc, wanted Jean Grey to stay
   dead after Dark Phoenix blew herself up on the moon and Jean’s comatose
   human body rejected the Phoenix force -- but he had his reasons.

   “I would have been much happier if she’d stayed dead,” Claremont
   admitted, “because ... the other X-Men suddenly realized we are mortal.
   We are not protected by the fact that we’re all copyrighted and
   trademarked.”

   SYFY WIRE recently caught up with Claremont to get his reasoning behind
   this controversial opinion. As you can hear in the video above,
   Claremont doesn’t believe that being inked in comics should necessarily
   make a character immortal, or that all the mutants absolutely need to
   live forever to be in “movies and what have you.” He also teased that
   after doing it to Jean, he could have done it to any character. Who
   would have been next? Storm, as he suggested? Nobody is safe, no matter
   how they can manipulate the weather, inanimate objects, or people’s
   minds.

   By the time Claremont found out longtime Fantastic Four and X-Men
   collaborator John Byrne had decided to bring Jean back from the grave,
   it was already too late.

   Then you have to remember that resurrecting Jean also resurrects her
   relationship with Scott by default, except he’s married to her clone.
   Meaning, he’s essentially married to an alt-Jean Grey because Madelyne
   Pryor has that exact DNA. They have a newborn son, who may be a genetic
   mashup between him and Madelyne, except that being the spawn of Jean
   Grey’s clone also technically makes him Jean’s offspring. Scott was
   only ever attracted to Maddie because of her uncanny resemblance to
   Jean. Would Cyclops really be cheating if he was just bringing home the
   original specimen?

   It’s complicated. “So you’re talking about taking a character, having
   him walk out on his wife and newborn son to go back to his old
   girlfriend,” Claremont said. “What kind of hero would do that?”

   Apparently, the kind of hero that... oh, just read the comics!

   The most current map of the Milky Way is shown in an artist’s
   representation. The Sun is directly below the galactic center, near the
   Orion Spur. The Scutum-Centaurus arms sweeps out to the right and
   above, going behind the center to the far side.
   Where is the Sun located in the Milky Way?
