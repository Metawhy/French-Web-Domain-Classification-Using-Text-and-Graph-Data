    Mark's note: I teach the first 2 animal sets very early on.  They are
   broken up into sets with some easy vocabulary and a few more difficult
   ones.  I use these sets for practicing "What's this? It's ~ ." and "Is
     that ~?  No, it's not ~."  The third set I do later, just before I
                           introduce There is/are.

    Mark's note: I use this first set to practice 'where?' - -> 'at ...'
                 and to practice the third person singular:

                          - 'She works at an arcade.'

                           - 'Where does s/he work?'

     This set is also good for introducing some places around town.  For
      more third person singular practice see the fruit sets and sports
             sets.  For more places in town see the places set.

    Mark's note: I use this first set to practice 'works as ...' and I do
    it after the first set.  Once the students get good at it, I add 'at
                         ...' for a meatier sentence

                 - He works as a lifeguard at the public pool.

                - He works as a cook at a fast-food restaurant.

     I use these sets with older students and adults to talk about what
    people do at their jobs. It's a great way to introduce a lot of verbs
                and again practice the third person singular.
      - She works at a clothing store.  She helps customers, sells clothes
                            and cleans the store.

        - He works as a waiter at a restaurant.  He takes orders, serves
                       food and cleans the restaurant.

                              Part-Time Jobs 3:

    He works flipping burgers, He works carrying stuff, They work moving
   furniture, He works painting fences, He works stacking cans, She works

                                    like.
