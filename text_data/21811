Introduction

   Synology holds itself to high standards in handling and processing
   personal information. The statement outlined below establishes the
   boundaries of what Synology processes and what you, as our customer and
   the data subject ("users"), are entitled to. This Privacy Statement
   applies when you use our features and services ("Services").
   Additionally, we have a Cookie Policy for use of our website.

   Synology operates around the world and has adopted English as the
   controlling language of this Privacy Statement. Additional translations
   are provided for convenience. You may switch to other languages by

Your Personal Data

   Personal data refers to identifying information that relates to an
   individual. Identification can be by the data alone or in conjunction
   with any other data in the data controller's possession or likely to
   come into such possession. Synology collects information only to
   provide you with the Services that you opted into. In order to provide
   you with our products or Services, including responding to your
   inquiries, we may ask for your personal information. If you choose not
   to provide the requested information, we may be unable to deliver the
   desired Services. Most of Synology's Services are provided under a
   Synology Account, and if you no longer require the Service or wish to
   have your data removed, you may delete your Synology Account.

   In general, Synology collects personal data from you via mail, email,
   telephone, or via our cookies for the purpose of delivering our
   Services to you, details of which are further set forth in the
   "Services" section of this policy, to operate our websites to provide
   you access to and use of our websites and Services, to administer your
   use of our Services, to communicate with you and respond to your
   requests, to manage your account, to customize your Service experience
   with us, to improve our Services and products, to provide you with our
   online or offline marketing measures and activities, including but not
   limited to newsletters, online and live event registrations, and other
   promotional information and materials, to share your contact details
   with our subsidiaries, affiliates, authorized repair and support
   centers, authorized logistics companies, communications infrastructure,
   and other entities deemed necessary to carry out providing these
   Services to you, to share your contact details with our affiliate
   offices around the world within our group of companies for the purposes
   of internal administration and back-office support, to ensure our
   network security, and to prevent fraud, to enforce or defend our
   policies or contract with you, and to maintain the integrity and safety
   of our data technology systems that store and process your personal
   data. Examples of data we collect and store include:
     * Your e-mail address, which is used as identification for our
       services and as the primary communication method.

       information are used to provide registration, device shipping, and
       billing verification services.
     * Your payment method and financial data (credit card, bank account
       number, etc.), which is used for payment transactions for a service
       or product, logistics and billing data (such as customs ID and
       tracking number).
     * Your IP address, unique device identifiers, referral URL, computer
       and connection data such as the type of operating system you use,
       device and software information, browser type, browser language and
       version, ad data, access times, browsing history, website
       preferences and web log information used for fraud prevention,
       security purposes, for warranty registration, support services, and
       for transactions.
     * Your account login, account name, account number, password, account
       activity, files accessed or used by you, transaction data and any
       information you provide during a transaction, or other
       transaction-based content that you generate or connected to your
       account as a result of your transaction.
     * Your chat and service history with us, and any other information
       you may provide us when you interact with us.

   Other information that you provide to us through digital or physical
   means may be stored on a case-by-case basis depending on the reason it
   was provided.

   For more specific information on the data collected and ways they are
   stored, please refer to the Services section.

Non-Personal Data

   Synology may collect additional information that, by itself, cannot be
   used to identify any specific individual. This information is used to
   help facilitate our business operations. For example:
     * Device analytics are opt-in and used to understand how our users
       interact with our products and services. Information collected
       cannot be used to identify our users nor the data that they store
       on their devices. Refer to the Services section for more
       information.
     * We collect single-session information from our users when they
       browse our website, including help articles, to understand which
       topics are more important and if the content is relevant to our
       users or potential customers. Read our Cookie Policy.

Lawful Bases and Other Usage

   The lawful bases for Synology to process your personal data for the
   various types of processing performed on your personal data are, as
   applicable, processing based on your consent, as necessary for us to
   enter into and to perform our contract with you, or in certain
   circumstances, as necessary for Synology to pursue our "legitimate
   interests", where our interests are not outweighed by your rights and
   freedoms.

   "Legitimate interest" situations necessitating such actions may include
   the following: to protect you, us, or others from security threats, to
   comply with laws we are subjected to, to implement information sharing
   within Synology's group affiliates, to prevent fraud, misuse of company
   IT systems, to operate a whistleblowing scheme, for purposes of mergers
   and acquisitions, and to perform internal investigations and auditing.

   Synology will collect, process, and use the personal data supplied by
   you only for the purposes communicated to you and will not disclose
   your data to third parties except under the lawful bases set forth
   above. Synology does not share your personal information with third
   parties for the purpose of direct marketing.

   You are not under any obligation to provide us any of your personal
   data. However, please note that without certain data from you, we may
   not able to undertake some or all of our obligations to you under our
   contract with you, or adequately provide you with our full range of
   services. If you would like to obtain more detail about this, please
   contact us following the instructions in the "Contact Information"
   section below.

Period of Storage

   Synology keeps your personal data for no longer than reasonably
   necessary for the given purpose for which your data is processed. If
   you will provide us, or have provided us, consent for us to process
   your data, we will process your data for no longer than your consent is
   effective. Notwithstanding the above, we may retain your personal data
   as required by applicable laws and regulations, as necessary to assist
   with any government and judicial investigations, to initiate or defend
   legal claims or for the purpose of civil, criminal, or administrative
   proceedings. If none of the above grounds for us to keep your data
   apply, we will delete and dispose of your data in a secure manner.

Data Controllers, Contracting Parties, Transfer of Data

   We use the term "Designated Countries" to refer to countries that are
   in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and
   Switzerland.

   If you reside in Designated Countries, Synology GmbH ("Synology
   Germany") will be the controller of your personal data. Synology
   Germany would be responsible for collecting, and processing data per
   our services, which will be covered by the Terms of Service of the
   relevant service.

   For users residing outside of Designated Countries, Synology Inc.
   ("Synology Taiwan") will be the controller of your personal data. Your
   usage of services provided by Synology will be bound by the Terms of
   Service of the relevant service.

   Synology's Services include providing technical support, device
   replacement, payment services, event registration, as well as the
   transfer of data based on users' decisions, around the world. The
   nature of these Services requires us to be able to transfer data into
   and out of the European Union (EU) to Synology subsidiaries,
   affiliates, authorized repair and support centers, authorized logistics
   companies, communications infrastructure, and other entities deemed
   necessary to carry out providing these Services. We may also transfer
   your data to third-party service providers whom we subcontract to work
   on our behalf or for us and therefore may have access to the data only
   for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf and under
   obligations similar to those described in this Privacy Statement, who
   perform functions such as data processing, auditing, order fulfillment,
   managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service,
   conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys, marketing
   support, payment processing and invoice collection support,
   informational systems technical support, to help us provide, analyze,
   and improve our Services and to assist us in detecting and dealing with
   data breaches, illegal activities, and fraud. We may also share your
   personal data with governments and/or government-affiliated
   institutions, courts, or law enforcement agencies, to comply with our
   obligations under relevant laws and regulations, enforce or defend our
   policies or contract with you, respond to claims, or in response to a
   verified request relating to a government or criminal investigation;
   provided that, if any law enforcement agency requests your data, we
   will attempt to redirect the law enforcement agency to request that
   data directly from you, and in such event, we may provide your basic
   contact information to the law enforcement agency. We may also provide
   your data to third parties involved in a legal proceeding, if they
   provide us with a court order or substantially similar legal procedure
   requiring us to do so. The above parties are the recipients of your
   personal data.

   Synology safeguards EU personal data when transferred out by adopting
   European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses as a legal
   mechanism for data transfers to locations the European Commission have
   not deemed to have an adequate level of data protection.

   required and collected information differing on a per service basis.
   Unless subject to an exemption, you will have the following rights with
   respect to your personal data:
     * The right to delete data: You can ask us to delete data for which
       we no longer need in order to provide service to you.
     * The right to correct or change data: You can modify your contact
       information through your Synology Account. You can also ask us to

       unable to be changed by yourself.
     * The right to object: You can object to the usage of some or all of
       your personal data which is based on legitimate interests pursued
       by Synology.
     * The right to restrict use of data: You can ask us to stop or limit
       the usage of some or all of your personal data that we no longer
       need, in order to provide service to you, or have legal rights to

     * The right of access: You may request a copy of your personal data
       that we have at the time.
     * The right of portability: You may request us to transmit your
       personal data directly to another data controller, where the
       processing is based on your consent or is necessary for the
       performance of a contract with you, and in either case, we process
       the data by automated means.

   You may make these requests by submitting a request through your
   Synology Account or through our website. Upon receipt, we will evaluate
   your request and inform you how we intend to proceed. Under certain
   circumstances, and according to applicable European Union or European
   Union state laws and regulations, we may withhold access to your data,
   or decline to modify, erase, port, or restrict the processing of your
   data. Synology will respond to your request within thirty days after

   legal obligations, which differ on a per service basis.

Package Center

   Synology collects package download information from your Synology
   device in order to help us understand how we can better improve our
   devices and software. The data we collect does not contain information
   that can identify you, the user. When a Synology device issues a

   activity in Package Center. None of this information contains any of
   your personal information or metadata pertaining to your files. Package
   Center does not track or record your device's serial number, MAC
   address, or IP addresses for uses that do not require additional
   licenses. For more information please refer to Package Center's Terms
   of Service.

   licensing purposes, including product serial number, IP address, MAC
   address, and registered Synology Account. We store this information to
   verify your license when it is applied to a Synology device.

   Activating and updating packages will usually require an Internet
   connection to our servers. We identify your Synology device with a
   unique device ID.

   For record keeping and future troubleshooting, we may keep track of
   information such as whether the update was successful or not. We may
   use the information collected through activation or updates to validate
   your license status.

   distributed or published by third-parties may collect additional
   information regarding you or your device. Synology requires third-party
   developers to be transparent about all practices. However, Synology
   does not control or have the capability to completely verify claims,
   nor is Synology responsible for any practices performed by third-party
   packages. When you install third-party packages, you should read and
   understand the end user license agreements (EULA), privacy
   statements/policies/notices, and terms of use/service that may be
   presented to you.

   Users should contact the third party directly for any questions or
   problems you have in using third-party packages.

   Certain third-party packages may utilize Synology's Package Center for
   payment services. Synology will collect the same information as listed
   in the "Payment" section. Synology does not disclose your personal
   information to third-parties and only presents the information as an
   aggregated figure.

   that is needed to investigate, respond to, and resolve your technical
   support request.

   When you make a phone request to Synology's Technical Support hotline,
   our technical support agent will ask for your consent on phone
   recording at the beginning of the conversation. Your personal
   information, including name, email, telephone number, and detail on
   your Synology product will be recorded in our systems. You may view,
   track, respond to your Technical Support ticket via your Synology
   Account. If you don't have a Synology Account, Synology's technical

How we use your data

   When you submit a Technical Support form in your Synology Account, you
   are required to provide the essential product information that is
   needed to investigate, respond to, and resolve your technical support
   request. During the investigation, Synology may request additional
   information that is required to resolve the matter. Depending on the
   complexity and the severity of the request, the support ticket may be
   escalated to parties within Synology to investigate, respond to, and
   resolve your request. The information revealed to involved parties is
   strictly limited. Synology restricts access to both the raw and
   aggregated data by specific employee roles.

   Synology only uses information we obtain from technical support
   requests to resolve your issue. After removing your personal
   information, we may use some of the technical details to generate bug
   reports if the problem was previously unknown to implement a solution
   for our products.

   If shipping is required, your shipping address and contact information
   may be passed to third-party logistics partners.

How we store your data

   Synology restricts access to both the raw and aggregated data by
   specific employee roles.

   When you upload files for your support ticket, Synology will retain
   them for up to 90 days after the ticket has been resolved.

   When you provide remote access information, Synology will retain it
   until the ticket has been resolved.

   Synology keeps communication records and survey records for a minimum
   of three years for internal auditing and statistical purposes. If you
   wish to remove your personal information from our systems, you may
   choose to delete your Synology Account. We may choose to retain
   technical details of the problem, such as steps to reproduce it, the
   technical details of the environment, and what steps were taken to
   resolve it.

   inventory control purposes indefinitely.

Synology Application Service

Data we collect

   Synology Application Service collects the message contents you create
   in MailPlus, Synology Chat, and other supported applications and
   transmits them to Synology SNS server and push services of Apple,
   Google, or Mozilla, in order to notify the recipients about new

   device information of client devices will be collected and transmitted
   to Synology SNS server and third-party push servers. This is done to
   pair the message content with the correct device. None of this data
   contains any of your personal information, and Synology does not track
   your device's serial number, MAC addresses, or IP addresses.

How we use your data

   All the message contents transmitted to Synology SNS server and third
   parties are encrypted by Synology Application Service, ensuring your
   personal data is not accessible to others. The browser and device
   information of client devices is only used for pairing.

How we store your data

   All the data collected by Synology Application Service will be removed
   immediately on Synology SNS server after they are transmitted to the
   third-party push services, so no data will be stored by Synology.

   cannot be identified from the transmitted information. Notifications
   are discarded after being sent, excluding the seven-day retention
   period on the NAS.

Mobile Applications

Data we collect

   Synology collects operating system information from your mobile device
   in order to help us customize content for particular Synology devices,
   if you enable usage data sharing or device analytics on your Synology
   device. The data we collect does not contain information that may
   identify you, the user.

   Synology uses Google Analytics for Firebase to collect Synology mobile
   Apps usage data and generates a usage statistics report. For example,
   the Apps usage data includes, but is not limited to, the type of mobile
   device you use, and the way you use the mobile Apps. The statistics
   report is generated by aggregating App usage data. The statistics
   report does not contain information that may identify you, the user.

   If the App crashes when you are using, Firebase also generates a crash
   report for us including system information, software versions, and
   crash logs. The crash report does not contain information that may
   identify you, the user.

   Synology collects device information from mobile apps supporting push
   notifications (app name, app version, and the push notification
   message). Please refer to the Push Notification and/or Synology
   Application Service sections for more information.

How we use your data

   Synology leverages aggregated application statistics from Firebase
   tool, iOS or Android store platforms to better understand our user
   distribution. You can opt out any time by updating your preferences in
   the settings of the iOS or Android devices.

   Synology collects crash report from Firebase to only improve quality
   and to further develop our products and services. Crash information
   helps us to investigate problems and better understand what triggers
   them. You can opt out any time by disabling the analytic feature in the
   setting of the iOS or Android devices.

How we store your data

   Synology retains statistics report and crash report for up to 14 months
   in order to generate useful information. Synology restricts access to
   both statistics report and crash report by specific employee roles.

Alexa Services

Data we collect

   Synology collects the address and OAuth information of your Synology
   device, in order to authorize your NAS to complete the account linking
   process required for the Amazon Alexa service.

How we use your data

   Synology only stores information to authorize the Amazon Alexa service
   to access your NAS content, such as by enabling the Audio Station Skill
   to allow Amazon Alexa access your music in Audio Station. Synology does
   not use this information for any other purpose. We do not share this
   information.

How we store your data

   Data collected by this method are automatically deleted after six
   months of inactivity.

Security

   Synology employs multiple methods of data protection in order to
   minimize the risk of misuse, unauthorized access and disclosure, and
   loss of access. Some of these safeguards include the use of
   pseudonymization, data encryption, data hashing, and other technologies
   and permission control methods. When our employees directly handle, or
   access your personal information, we do so on secured networks and
   through fine-grained permission control to limit who can access your
   information. Data you provide to us is encrypted and stored on both
   third-party storage and on Synology-managed devices, depending on the
   service.

   Synology logs and stores IP addresses of both users to our web services
   solely for security purposes. This log is archived and then removed at
   irregular intervals depending on ongoing or existing security threats
   or investigations. If Synology has overwhelming evidence that certain
   IP addresses, users, or devices may be purposely damaging or hindering
   our operations or service quality, we may deny further services and/or
   report such behavior to relevant authorities.

   Synology removes data that is no longer required to provide services
   based on each service.

Changes to Statement

   Synology may make amendments to this document when needed to reflect
   statement updates, customer feedback, as well as new products or
   services. We will provide a brief overview of the changes, and if the
   terms modify the way we process or handle your data or affect your
   rights, we will notify you through direct message or by posting notices
   if we are unable to directly reach you. We encourage that you regularly
   review this Privacy Statement to understand how your data is handled.

Data from Children

   Synology's products and services are targeted at professionals and are
   not designed nor intended to be used by children under 16 years of age.
   Synology does not typically collect date of birth information as it is
   not used by Synology. If children under the minimum age of the relevant
   jurisdiction must use Synology's products and services, explicit
   parental consent must be provided and verified. If Synology is notified
   or discovers that data collected is from a child under the minimum age,
   we will take procedures to delete the information as soon as possible.

Do Not Track

   Synology does not track users to provide targeted advertising and
   therefore will not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.

Notice to End Users

   Certain Synology products or services may be managed or administered to
   you by organizations or other users. Your use of these managed Synology
   products or services will be affected by the terms or policies that are

10. User Content and Interactive Services or Areas

   The Site may include discussion forums, user generated content or other
   interactive areas or services ("Interactive Areas"), including chat
   rooms or message boards, online hosting or storage services, or other
   areas or services in which you or other users create, post or store any
   content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound,
   photos, video, graphics, code or other items or materials on the Site
   ("User Content"). Synology forums, including without limitation the
   Synology forum located at http://forum.synology.com and the Synology
   Wiki located at http://forum.synology.com/wiki, may include additional
   terms and conditions that will apply to your use of the forum or the
   Wiki. In the event of any conflict between any provisions in the forum
   or Wiki, the terms and conditions of these Site Terms will prevail. You
   are solely responsible for your use of the Interactive Areas and use
   them and the User Content at your own risk.

   By using any Interactive Areas, you agree not to post, upload to,
   transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the
   Site: (a) any User Content that is unlawful, libelous, defamatory,
   obscene, pornographic, indecent, lewd, suggestive, harassing,
   threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, abusive,
   inflammatory, fraudulent or otherwise objectionable; (b) any User
   Content that would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a
   criminal offense, violate the rights of any party, or that would
   otherwise create liability or violate any local, state, national or
   international law; (c) any User Content that may infringe any patent,
   trademark, trade secret, copyright or other intellectual or proprietary
   right of any party; (d) any User Content that impersonates any person
   or entity or otherwise misrepresents your affiliation with a person or
   entity; (e) unsolicited promotions, political campaigning, advertising
   or solicitations; (f) private information of any third party,
   including, without limitation, addresses, phone numbers, email
   addresses, Social Security numbers and credit card numbers; (g)
   viruses, corrupted data or other harmful, disruptive or destructive
   files; and (h) any User Content that, in the sole judgment of Synology,
   would otherwise restrict or inhibit any other person from using or
   enjoying the Interactive Areas or the Site, or which may expose
   Synology or its users to any harm or liability of any type.

   By posting User Content, you represent and warrant that you have the
   lawful right to distribute and reproduce such User Content. Synology
   takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content
   posted, stored or uploaded by you or any third party, or for any loss
   or damage thereto, nor is Synology liable for any mistakes, defamation,
   slander, libel, omissions, falsehoods, obscenity, pornography or
   profanity you may encounter. Your use of Interactive Areas is at your
   own risk. As a provider of interactive services, Synology is not liable
   for any statements, representations or User Content provided by its
   users in any public forum, personal home page or other Interactive
   Area. Enforcement of the user content or conduct rules set forth in
   these Site Terms is solely at Synology's discretion, and failure to
   enforce such rules in some instances does not constitute a waiver of
   our right to enforce such rules in other instances. In addition, these
   rules do not create any private right of action on the part of any
   third party or any reasonable expectation that the Site will not
   contain any content that is prohibited by such rules. Although Synology
   has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the User Content
   posted in any Interactive Area, Synology reserves the right, and has
   absolute discretion, to remove, screen or edit any User Content posted
   or stored on the Site at any time and for any reason without notice,
   and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and
   replacing any User Content you post or store on the Site at your sole
   cost and expense. Any use of the Interactive Areas or other portions of
   the Site in violation of the foregoing violates these Site Terms and
   may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your
   rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Site. In order to
   cooperate with legitimate governmental requests, subpoenas or court
   orders, to protect Synology's systems and customers, or to ensure the
   integrity and operation of Synology's business and systems, Synology
   may access and disclose any information it considers necessary or
   appropriate, including, without limitation, user profile information
   (i.e. name, e-mail address, etc.), IP addressing and traffic
   information, usage history, and posted User Content. Synology's right
   to disclose any such information shall govern over any contrary terms
   of Synology's Privacy Policy.

   If you post User Content to the Site, unless we indicate otherwise, you
   grant Synology and its affiliates a nonexclusive, royalty-free,
   perpetual, irrevocable and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce,
   modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from,
   distribute, perform and display such User Content throughout the world
   in any media on or in connection with the Site. You grant Synology and
   its affiliates and sublicensees the right to use the name that you
   submit in connection with such content, if they choose. You represent
   and warrant that (x) you own and control all of the rights to the User
   Content that you post or you otherwise have the right to post such User
   Content to the Site, (y) the User Content is accurate and not
   misleading, and (z) use and posting of the User Content you supply does
   not violate these Site Terms and will not violate any rights of or
   cause injury to any person or entity.

   accurate, current and complete information about you as may be prompted

   Additionally, we have a Cookie Policy for use of our website.

   are provided for convenience. You may switch to other languages by

Your Personal Data

   Personal data refers to identifying information that relates to an

   with any other data in the data controller's possession or likely to
   come into such possession. Synology collects information only to
   provide you with the Services that you opted into. In order to provide
   you with our products or Services, including responding to your
   inquiries, we may ask for your personal information. If you choose not
   to provide the requested information, we may be unable to deliver the
   desired Services. Most of Synology's Services are provided under a
   Synology Account, and if you no longer require the Service or wish to
   have your data removed, you may delete your Synology Account.

   In general, Synology collects personal data from you via mail, email,
   telephone, or via our cookies for the purpose of delivering our
   Services to you, details of which are further set forth in the
   "Services" section of this policy, to operate our websites to provide

   use of our Services, to communicate with you and respond to your
   requests, to manage your account, to customize your Service experience

   with our subsidiaries, affiliates, authorized repair and support
   centers, authorized logistics companies, communications infrastructure,
   and other entities deemed necessary to carry out providing these
   Services to you, to share your contact details with our affiliate
   offices around the world within our group of companies for the purposes
   of internal administration and back-office support, to ensure our
   network security, and to prevent fraud, to enforce or defend our
   policies or contract with you, and to maintain the integrity and safety
   of our data technology systems that store and process your personal

       you may provide us when you interact with us.

   stored, please refer to the Services section.

Non-Personal Data

   Synology may collect additional information that, by itself, cannot be
   used to identify any specific individual. This information is used to
   help facilitate our business operations. For example:
     * Device analytics are opt-in and used to understand how our users
       interact with our products and services. Information collected
       cannot be used to identify our users nor the data that they store
       on their devices. Refer to the Services section for more
       information.
     * We collect single-session information from our users when they
       browse our website, including help articles, to understand which
       topics are more important and if the content is relevant to our
       users or potential customers. Read our Cookie Policy.

Lawful Bases and Other Usage

   The lawful bases for Synology to process your personal data for the
   various types of processing performed on your personal data are, as
   applicable, processing based on your consent, as necessary for us to
   enter into and to perform our contract with you, or in certain
   circumstances, as necessary for Synology to pursue our "legitimate
   interests", where our interests are not outweighed by your rights and
   freedoms.

   "Legitimate interest" situations necessitating such actions may include
   the following: to protect you, us, or others from security threats, to
   comply with laws we are subjected to, to implement information sharing
   within Synology's group affiliates, to prevent fraud, misuse of company
   IT systems, to operate a whistleblowing scheme, for purposes of mergers
   and acquisitions, and to perform internal investigations and auditing.

   Synology will collect, process, and use the personal data supplied by
   you only for the purposes communicated to you and will not disclose
   your data to third parties except under the lawful bases set forth
   above. Synology does not share your personal information with third
   parties for the purpose of direct marketing.

   You are not under any obligation to provide us any of your personal
   data. However, please note that without certain data from you, we may
   not able to undertake some or all of our obligations to you under our
   contract with you, or adequately provide you with our full range of
   services. If you would like to obtain more detail about this, please
   contact us following the instructions in the "Contact Information"
   section below.

Period of Storage

   Synology keeps your personal data for no longer than reasonably
   necessary for the given purpose for which your data is processed. If
   you will provide us, or have provided us, consent for us to process
   your data, we will process your data for no longer than your consent is
   effective. Notwithstanding the above, we may retain your personal data
   as required by applicable laws and regulations, as necessary to assist
   with any government and judicial investigations, to initiate or defend
   legal claims or for the purpose of civil, criminal, or administrative
   proceedings. If none of the above grounds for us to keep your data
   apply, we will delete and dispose of your data in a secure manner.

Data Controllers, Contracting Parties, Transfer of Data

   We use the term "Designated Countries" to refer to countries that are
   in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and
   Switzerland.

   If you reside in Designated Countries, Synology GmbH ("Synology
   Germany") will be the controller of your personal data. Synology
   Germany would be responsible for collecting, and processing data per
   our services, which will be covered by the Terms of Service of the
   relevant service.

   For users residing outside of Designated Countries, Synology Inc.
   ("Synology Taiwan") will be the controller of your personal data. Your
   usage of services provided by Synology will be bound by the Terms of
   Service of the relevant service.

   Synology's Services include providing technical support, device
   replacement, payment services, event registration, as well as the
   transfer of data based on users' decisions, around the world. The
   nature of these Services requires us to be able to transfer data into
   and out of the European Union (EU) to Synology subsidiaries,
   affiliates, authorized repair and support centers, authorized logistics
   companies, communications infrastructure, and other entities deemed
   necessary to carry out providing these Services. We may also transfer
   your data to third-party service providers whom we subcontract to work
   on our behalf or for us and therefore may have access to the data only
   for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf and under
   obligations similar to those described in this Privacy Statement, who
   perform functions such as data processing, auditing, order fulfillment,
   managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service,
   conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys, marketing
   support, payment processing and invoice collection support,
   informational systems technical support, to help us provide, analyze,
   and improve our Services and to assist us in detecting and dealing with
   data breaches, illegal activities, and fraud. We may also share your
   personal data with governments and/or government-affiliated
   institutions, courts, or law enforcement agencies, to comply with our
   obligations under relevant laws and regulations, enforce or defend our
   policies or contract with you, respond to claims, or in response to a
   verified request relating to a government or criminal investigation;
   provided that, if any law enforcement agency requests your data, we
   will attempt to redirect the law enforcement agency to request that
   data directly from you, and in such event, we may provide your basic
   contact information to the law enforcement agency. We may also provide
   your data to third parties involved in a legal proceeding, if they
   provide us with a court order or substantially similar legal procedure
   requiring us to do so. The above parties are the recipients of your
   personal data.

   Synology safeguards EU personal data when transferred out by adopting
   European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses as a legal
   mechanism for data transfers to locations the European Commission have
   not deemed to have an adequate level of data protection.

       the data by automated means.

   You may make these requests by submitting a request through your

   address, and registered Synology Account. We store this information to
   verify your license when it is applied to a Synology device.

   connection to our servers. We identify your Synology device with a
   unique device ID.

   information such as whether the update was successful or not. We may
   use the information collected through activation or updates to validate
   your license status.

   developers to be transparent about all practices. However, Synology
   does not control or have the capability to completely verify claims,
   nor is Synology responsible for any practices performed by third-party
   packages. When you install third-party packages, you should read and
   understand the end user license agreements (EULA), privacy
   statements/policies/notices, and terms of use/service that may be
   presented to you.

   payment services. Synology will collect the same information as listed
   in the "Payment" section. Synology does not disclose your personal
   information to third-parties and only presents the information as an
   aggregated figure.

   example, information on the settings of Internet environment, the
   operating system, and packages. Additionally, we may collect
   information on how you interact with certain functionality or user
   interface elements. None of this information contains any of your
   personal information or metadata pertaining to your files. Synology

   addresses.

How we use your data

   key. This key will be used to search for the information your device
   has sent.

   network. If you disable this option, you will be unable to find devices
   that have already been setup unless you remember their IP addresses or

   your network when you access "find.synology.com" and
   "router.synology.com". Synology does not use this information for any
   other purpose. We do not share this information.

How we store your data

   Unless there is a technical issue with the system or per technical
   support request, Synology employees do not have access to the database.
   Data collected by this method are automatically deleted after six
   months of inactivity.

Marketing Events and Promotional Events

Data we collect

   Synology hosts events such as webinars, workshops, and product
   launches. You can sign up to join one of these from Synology's website.
   Registration may require a Synology Account, as well as may require
   additional survey information depending on the event. Synology
   collects, and stores information related to you that is available from
   your registration and from the survey.

   Some events may be hosted by a third party. With your consent, event
   hosts may share event attendees' information to their sponsors. In
   events where Synology is a co-host or sponsor, we may receive
   participants' information from event hosts.

   Some events may have registration fees, payment methods and personal
   information processed by Synology will be handled per the Payment
   section.

How we use your data

   Synology may contact you through email or other communication protocols
   with information regarding the registered event and/or about
   service-related issues.

How we store your data

   Your information is securely stored and only available to event
   organizers. Synology retains event participation information for at
   least four years due to legal obligations that are imposed on Synology
   and our subsidiaries. The actual storage period may differ depending on
   the host(s), venue, location, and type of event.

   If you would like to remove your information after the event, you may
   choose to delete your Synology Account. As some information is required
   for certain events, this may limit our ability to provide services or
   allow you attendance. You may also elect to unregister from the event
   if you no longer wish to attend.

   For events hosted that do not require a Synology Account, please
   contact Synology.

   Synology may request additional information to confirm your identity.

QuickConnect and Synology DDNS

Data we collect

   QuickConnect and Synology DDNS are free connection services provided by
   Synology. Users who wish to utilize these services must have a Synology
   Account. Synology collects certain information from your Synology
   device, including product serial number, IP address, and routing ports
   in order to provide the services to you.

How we use your data

   Synology uses the collected data to identify, authenticate, and provide
   Synology devices with QuickConnect and/or Synology DDNS service.

   Synology may be required to share your information to the extent
   necessary to comply with ICANN or any ccTLD rules, regulations and
   policies when you register a domain name with us.

How we store your data

   Unless there is a technical issue with the system or per a technical
   support request, Synology employees do not have access to the database.
   Users who signed up for the services may end the service at any time.
   Data collected is deleted when the relevant Synology Account is
   deleted.

Technical Support

Data we collect

   You may request Synology Technical Support assistance through our
   website, live chat, or by phone. Submitting a Technical Support form
   requires a Synology Account. Synology collects and stores information
   that is needed to investigate, respond to, and resolve your technical
   support request.

   When you make a phone request to Synology's Technical Support hotline,
   our technical support agent will ask for your consent on phone
   recording at the beginning of the conversation. Your personal
   information, including name, email, telephone number, and detail on
   your Synology product will be recorded in our systems. You may view,
   track, respond to your Technical Support ticket via your Synology
   Account. If you don't have a Synology Account, Synology's technical
   representative will create a temporary account. You must enable it to
   track ticket status and to receive follow up information.

   In some cases, you may be requested to provide remote access
   information. Synology technical support agents together in some cases
   with Synology software engineers may utilize the credentials provided
   to directly access your device.

   When a device replacement or spare part is requested, you will be
   required to provide a valid shipping address. In certain cases, you may
   be asked to provide payment for support services, shipping charges, or
   spare parts.

How we use your data

   When you submit a Technical Support form in your Synology Account, you
   are required to provide the essential product information that is
   needed to investigate, respond to, and resolve your technical support
   request. During the investigation, Synology may request additional
   information that is required to resolve the matter. Depending on the
   complexity and the severity of the request, the support ticket may be
   escalated to parties within Synology to investigate, respond to, and
   resolve your request. The information revealed to involved parties is
   strictly limited. Synology restricts access to both the raw and
   aggregated data by specific employee roles.

   Synology only uses information we obtain from technical support
   requests to resolve your issue. After removing your personal
   information, we may use some of the technical details to generate bug
   reports if the problem was previously unknown to implement a solution
   for our products.

   If shipping is required, your shipping address and contact information
   may be passed to third-party logistics partners.

How we store your data

   Synology restricts access to both the raw and aggregated data by
   specific employee roles.

   When you upload files for your support ticket, Synology will retain
   them for up to 90 days after the ticket has been resolved.

   When you provide remote access information, Synology will retain it
   until the ticket has been resolved.

   Synology keeps communication records and survey records for a minimum
   of three years for internal auditing and statistical purposes. If you
   wish to remove your personal information from our systems, you may
   choose to delete your Synology Account. We may choose to retain
   technical details of the problem, such as steps to reproduce it, the
   technical details of the environment, and what steps were taken to
   resolve it.

   Synology will keep all shipping records for internal auditing and
   inventory control purposes indefinitely.

Synology Application Service

Data we collect

   Synology Application Service collects the message contents you create
   in MailPlus, Synology Chat, and other supported applications and
   transmits them to Synology SNS server and push services of Apple,
   Google, or Mozilla, in order to notify the recipients about new
   messages on browsers or mobile apps. Additionally, the browser and
   device information of client devices will be collected and transmitted
   to Synology SNS server and third-party push servers. This is done to
   pair the message content with the correct device. None of this data
   contains any of your personal information, and Synology does not track
   your device's serial number, MAC addresses, or IP addresses.

How we use your data

   All the message contents transmitted to Synology SNS server and third
   parties are encrypted by Synology Application Service, ensuring your
   personal data is not accessible to others. The browser and device
   information of client devices is only used for pairing.

How we store your data

   All the data collected by Synology Application Service will be removed
   immediately on Synology SNS server after they are transmitted to the
   third-party push services, so no data will be stored by Synology.

Push Notifications

Data we collect

   Synology collects device-specific information (such as your hardware
   model, serial number, unique device identifiers, DiskStation ID, and
   notification destination device ID, token for push notification, and
   email).

How we use your data

   Synology uses the information collected from your devices in order to
   complete the push notification process from source to destination. The
   notification from DSM/SRM/Surveillance Station will be kept for seven
   days, for recalling previous notifications.

How we store your data

   The record used to identify the NAS is stored permanently. The NAS
   cannot be identified from the transmitted information. Notifications
   are discarded after being sent, excluding the seven-day retention
   period on the NAS.

Mobile Applications

Data we collect

   Synology collects operating system information from your mobile device
   in order to help us customize content for particular Synology devices,
   if you enable usage data sharing or device analytics on your Synology
   device. The data we collect does not contain information that may
   identify you, the user.

   Synology uses Google Analytics for Firebase to collect Synology mobile
   Apps usage data and generates a usage statistics report. For example,
   the Apps usage data includes, but is not limited to, the type of mobile
   device you use, and the way you use the mobile Apps. The statistics
   report is generated by aggregating App usage data. The statistics
   report does not contain information that may identify you, the user.

   If the App crashes when you are using, Firebase also generates a crash
   report for us including system information, software versions, and
   crash logs. The crash report does not contain information that may
   identify you, the user.

   Synology collects device information from mobile apps supporting push
   notifications (app name, app version, and the push notification
   message). Please refer to the Push Notification and/or Synology
   Application Service sections for more information.

How we use your data

   Synology leverages aggregated application statistics from Firebase
   tool, iOS or Android store platforms to better understand our user
   distribution. You can opt out any time by updating your preferences in
   the settings of the iOS or Android devices.

   Synology collects crash report from Firebase to only improve quality
   and to further develop our products and services. Crash information
   helps us to investigate problems and better understand what triggers
   them. You can opt out any time by disabling the analytic feature in the
   setting of the iOS or Android devices.

How we store your data

   Synology retains statistics report and crash report for up to 14 months
   in order to generate useful information. Synology restricts access to
   both statistics report and crash report by specific employee roles.

Alexa Services

Data we collect

   Synology collects the address and OAuth information of your Synology
   device, in order to authorize your NAS to complete the account linking
   process required for the Amazon Alexa service.

How we use your data

   Synology only stores information to authorize the Amazon Alexa service
   to access your NAS content, such as by enabling the Audio Station Skill
   to allow Amazon Alexa access your music in Audio Station. Synology does
   not use this information for any other purpose. We do not share this
   information.

How we store your data

   Data collected by this method are automatically deleted after six
   months of inactivity.

Security

   Synology employs multiple methods of data protection in order to
   minimize the risk of misuse, unauthorized access and disclosure, and
   loss of access. Some of these safeguards include the use of
   pseudonymization, data encryption, data hashing, and other technologies
   and permission control methods. When our employees directly handle, or
   access your personal information, we do so on secured networks and
   through fine-grained permission control to limit who can access your
   information. Data you provide to us is encrypted and stored on both
   third-party storage and on Synology-managed devices, depending on the
   service.

   Synology logs and stores IP addresses of both users to our web services
   solely for security purposes. This log is archived and then removed at
   irregular intervals depending on ongoing or existing security threats
   or investigations. If Synology has overwhelming evidence that certain
   IP addresses, users, or devices may be purposely damaging or hindering
   our operations or service quality, we may deny further services and/or
   report such behavior to relevant authorities.

   Synology removes data that is no longer required to provide services
   based on each service.

Changes to Statement

   Synology may make amendments to this document when needed to reflect
   statement updates, customer feedback, as well as new products or
   services. We will provide a brief overview of the changes, and if the
   terms modify the way we process or handle your data or affect your
   rights, we will notify you through direct message or by posting notices
   if we are unable to directly reach you. We encourage that you regularly
   review this Privacy Statement to understand how your data is handled.

Data from Children

   Synology's products and services are targeted at professionals and are
   not designed nor intended to be used by children under 16 years of age.
   Synology does not typically collect date of birth information as it is
   not used by Synology. If children under the minimum age of the relevant
   jurisdiction must use Synology's products and services, explicit
   parental consent must be provided and verified. If Synology is notified
   or discovers that data collected is from a child under the minimum age,
   we will take procedures to delete the information as soon as possible.

Do Not Track

   Synology does not track users to provide targeted advertising and
   therefore will not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.

Notice to End Users

   Certain Synology products or services may be managed or administered to
   you by organizations or other users. Your use of these managed Synology
   products or services will be affected by the terms or policies that are
   provided and dictated by the organization or service provider. Please
   direct inquiries in these instances to the administrator of the device
   or service. Synology will not be responsible for the privacy or
   security practices, including the lawfulness of practices for our
   customers as they may manage or implement our products and services in
   a manner that is no longer determined by Synology's policies or
   agreements.

   You can directly contact us through your Synology Account, or by

10. User Content and Interactive Services or Areas

   The Site may include discussion forums, user generated content or other
   interactive areas or services ("Interactive Areas"), including chat
   rooms or message boards, online hosting or storage services, or other
   areas or services in which you or other users create, post or store any
   content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound,
   photos, video, graphics, code or other items or materials on the Site
   ("User Content"). Synology forums, including without limitation the
   Synology forum located at http://forum.synology.com and the Synology
   Wiki located at http://forum.synology.com/wiki, may include additional
   terms and conditions that will apply to your use of the forum or the
   Wiki. In the event of any conflict between any provisions in the forum
   or Wiki, the terms and conditions of these Site Terms will prevail. You
   are solely responsible for your use of the Interactive Areas and use
   them and the User Content at your own risk.

   By using any Interactive Areas, you agree not to post, upload to,
   transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the
   Site: (a) any User Content that is unlawful, libelous, defamatory,
   obscene, pornographic, indecent, lewd, suggestive, harassing,
   threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, abusive,
   inflammatory, fraudulent or otherwise objectionable; (b) any User
   Content that would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a
   criminal offense, violate the rights of any party, or that would
   otherwise create liability or violate any local, state, national or
   international law; (c) any User Content that may infringe any patent,
   trademark, trade secret, copyright or other intellectual or proprietary
   right of any party; (d) any User Content that impersonates any person
   or entity or otherwise misrepresents your affiliation with a person or
   entity; (e) unsolicited promotions, political campaigning, advertising
   or solicitations; (f) private information of any third party,
   including, without limitation, addresses, phone numbers, email
   addresses, Social Security numbers and credit card numbers; (g)
   viruses, corrupted data or other harmful, disruptive or destructive
   files; and (h) any User Content that, in the sole judgment of Synology,
   would otherwise restrict or inhibit any other person from using or
   enjoying the Interactive Areas or the Site, or which may expose
   Synology or its users to any harm or liability of any type.

   By posting User Content, you represent and warrant that you have the
   lawful right to distribute and reproduce such User Content. Synology
   takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content
   posted, stored or uploaded by you or any third party, or for any loss
   or damage thereto, nor is Synology liable for any mistakes, defamation,
   slander, libel, omissions, falsehoods, obscenity, pornography or
   profanity you may encounter. Your use of Interactive Areas is at your
   own risk. As a provider of interactive services, Synology is not liable
   for any statements, representations or User Content provided by its
   users in any public forum, personal home page or other Interactive
   Area. Enforcement of the user content or conduct rules set forth in
   these Site Terms is solely at Synology's discretion, and failure to
   enforce such rules in some instances does not constitute a waiver of
   our right to enforce such rules in other instances. In addition, these
   rules do not create any private right of action on the part of any
   third party or any reasonable expectation that the Site will not
   contain any content that is prohibited by such rules. Although Synology
   has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the User Content
   posted in any Interactive Area, Synology reserves the right, and has
   absolute discretion, to remove, screen or edit any User Content posted
   or stored on the Site at any time and for any reason without notice,
   and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and
   replacing any User Content you post or store on the Site at your sole
   cost and expense. Any use of the Interactive Areas or other portions of
   the Site in violation of the foregoing violates these Site Terms and
   may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your
   rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Site. In order to
   cooperate with legitimate governmental requests, subpoenas or court
   orders, to protect Synology's systems and customers, or to ensure the
   integrity and operation of Synology's business and systems, Synology
   may access and disclose any information it considers necessary or
   appropriate, including, without limitation, user profile information
   (i.e. name, e-mail address, etc.), IP addressing and traffic
   information, usage history, and posted User Content. Synology's right
   to disclose any such information shall govern over any contrary terms
   of Synology's Privacy Policy.

   If you post User Content to the Site, unless we indicate otherwise, you
   grant Synology and its affiliates a nonexclusive, royalty-free,
   perpetual, irrevocable and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce,
   modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from,
   distribute, perform and display such User Content throughout the world
   in any media on or in connection with the Site. You grant Synology and
   its affiliates and sublicensees the right to use the name that you
   submit in connection with such content, if they choose. You represent
   and warrant that (x) you own and control all of the rights to the User
   Content that you post or you otherwise have the right to post such User
   Content to the Site, (y) the User Content is accurate and not
   misleading, and (z) use and posting of the User Content you supply does
   not violate these Site Terms and will not violate any rights of or
   cause injury to any person or entity.

Cookie Policy

   Effective 5/22/2018

   Synology websites and certain online services may use cookies, which
   are files that are placed on your device to enable data collection. If
   you opt-in to our use of cookies, we will use the information collected
   by cookies to better understand how you navigate our website and to
   assess your engagement, to remember customized settings and
   preferences, such as your language choice, and for purposes of
   personalizing marketing measures and re-marketing. All cookies will
   expire in 540 days from the day you visit Synology websites. After you
   have opted-in to our use of cookies, you can disable cookies by
   modifying settings in your browser. If you choose to do so, some
   functionalities that are dependent on cookies may not function
   properly. The following categories are defined by ICC UK Cookie guide.

Category 1 – Strictly necessary cookies

   These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the
   website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the
   website. Without these cookies, services you have asked for, like
   payment services or account authorization, cannot be provided.

Category 2 – Performance cookies

   These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for
   instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error
   messages from web pages. These cookies do not collect information that
   identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is
   aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how a
   website works.

Category 3 – Functionality cookies

   These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as
   your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide
   enhanced, more personal features. These cookies can also be used to
   remember changes you have to parts of web pages that you can customize.
   They may also be used to keep track of which notices you have already
   viewed to avoid repetition. The information these cookies collect will
   not personally identify you and cannot track your browsing activity on
   other websites.

Category 4 – Targeting cookies or advertising cookies

   These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your
   interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an
   advertisement as well as help to measure the effectiveness of the
   advertising campaigns. They are usually placed by advertising networks
   with the website operator's permission. They remember that you have
   visited a website and this information is shared with other
   organizations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising
   cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other
   organization. For example, in our remarketing or retargeting campaigns,
   we will serve targeted ads to you after you have visited or taken
   action on our website. In terms of technical execution, remarketing is
   the process of using a JavaScript tag to place a cookie in your
   browser. The cookie then informs a remarketing platform to serve
   specific display ads through an ad exchange, based on the pages or
   products you have engaged with or searched for on our website or app.

How do I refuse my consent to the use of cookies?

   If you do not want cookies to be stored on your device, you can adjust
   the setting of your browser to reject the setting of all or some
   cookies, and to alert you when a new cookie is added. For further
   information about how to do so, please refer to your browser help
   documentation. Please note that if you use your browser settings to
   block all cookies (including strictly necessary cookies) you may not be
   able to access or use all or parts or functionalities of our sites.
   If you want to remove previously-stored cookies, you can manually
   delete the cookies at any time. However, this will not prevent the
   sites from placing further cookies on your device unless you adjust
   your browser setting as described above.
   For more information on the development of user-profiles and the use of
   targeting and advertising cookies, please see www.youronlinechoices.eu
   if you are located in Europe, or www.aboutads.info/choices if in the
   United States.
