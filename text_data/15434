Reduced Food Waste

   This is the back end of a processing plant for vegetables in Burscough,
   Lancashire, UK. If you wonder why you have never seen a crooked carrot
   in your local market, commercial or natural, this is why. Vegetables
   are ruthlessly sorted to conform to “quality standards” set by the food
   chain, and this is the result. Some is carted off to piggeries, some as
   you can see is already rotting in the water.

   A third of the food raised or prepared does not make it from farm or
   factory to fork. Producing uneaten food squanders a whole host of
   resources—seeds, water, energy, land, fertilizer, hours of labor,
   financial capital—and generates greenhouse gases at every
   stage—including methane when organic matter lands in the global rubbish
   bin. The food we waste is responsible for roughly 8 percent of global
   emissions.

   Losing food to one waste heap or another is an issue in both high- and
   low-income countries. In places where income is low, wastage is
   generally unintentional and occurs earlier in the supply chain—food
   rots on farms or spoils during storage or distribution. In regions of
   higher income, willful food waste dominates farther along the supply
   chain. Retailers and consumers reject food based on bumps, bruises, and
   coloring, or simply order, buy, and serve too much.

   There are numerous and varied ways to address key waste points. In
   lower-income countries, improving infrastructure for storage,
   processing, and transportation is essential. In higher-income regions,
   major interventions are needed at the retail and consumer levels.
   National food-waste targets and policies can encourage widespread
   change. Beyond addressing emissions, these efforts can also help to
   meet future food demand.

   Global cost and savings data too variable to be determined
   Impact: After taking into account the adoption of plant-rich diets, if
   50 percent of food waste is reduced by 2050, avoided emissions could be
   equal to 26.2 gigatons of carbon dioxide. Reducing waste also avoids
   the deforestation for additional farmland, preventing 44.4 gigatons of
   additional emissions. We used forecasts of regional waste estimated
   from farm to household. This data shows that up to 35 percent of food
   in high-income economies is thrown out by consumers; in low-income
   economies, however, relatively little is wasted at the household level.

Technical Summary

   Reduced Food Waste

   Project Drawdown defines reduced food waste as: minimizing food loss
   and wastage from all stages of production, distribution, retail, and
   consumption. This solution replaces current reported trends in food
   waste by region.

   Estimates suggest that 30–40 percent of all food produced worldwide is
   wasted across the supply chain (Smith, P. et al., 2014). When food is
   wasted, all the energy, resources, and money that went into producing,
   processing, packaging, and transporting it are wasted too. The further
   down the supply chain the food gets before it is thrown out, the more
   resources are wasted to get it to that stage. If measures are taken to
   reduce food waste by improving storage and transport systems,
   generating public awareness, and changing consumer behavior, this
   solution could lead to substantial reductions in waste and carbon
   emissions.

   Methodology

   To evaluate the impact of reduced food waste, an independent model was
   created outside Drawdown’s core model framework to project food
   consumption and waste from 2020-2050. This was required due to the
   complexity of estimating country- and regional-scale food consumption
   and waste trends based on reported commodity types along the supply
   chain.

   Total Addressable Market

   The global market for reduced food waste is defined as the total demand
   for food, based on estimated kilocalories supplied per year for
   consumption by the world’s population. The baseline food consumption is
   projected for all countries up to 2060 in kilocalories per capita per
   year, using data compiled by the Food and Agriculture Organization
   (FAO) for the year 2013. [1] Future consumption is forecasted using
   growth factors from Alexandratos et al. (2012), which reflect projected
   dietary changes. [2]

   Total food loss and wastage is calculated according to regional
   estimates of waste generated at each supply chain stage [3] (FAO,
   2011), applied to aggregated country-level food demand by commodity
   type. Current adoption [4] of reduced food waste is considered to be
   zero percent.

   Adoption Scenarios [5]

   Impacts of increased adoption of reduced food waste from 2020-2050 were
   generated based on three growth scenarios, which were assessed in
   comparison to a Reference Scenario where the solution’s market share is
   fixed at the current levels.

   Adoption scenarios in this model grow linearly over time starting from
   the base year of 2014, and are considered “complete” in 2050. Linear
   growth trends were chosen because of the lack of country or regional
   data; additional behavioral research at more granular scales can reveal
   more representative adoption estimates.

   For reduced food waste, three scenarios were developed:
     * Plausible Scenario: This scenario assumes that a 50 percent
       reduction in total global food loss and wastage will be achieved by
       2050.
     * Drawdown Scenario: In this scenario, a 75 percent reduction in
       total global food loss and wastage by 2050 is modeled.
     * Optimum Scenario: Aligned with the Zero Hunger Challenge of
       eliminating food loss and wastage, this scenario assesses the
       impacts of a 100 percent reduction in total global food loss and
       wastage.

   Emissions Model

   To estimate emissions, commodity-specific carbon dioxide-equivalent
   per-calorie values were drawn from several sources (see Audsley et al.,
   2010; Heller and Keoleian, 2014; Hoolohan et al., 2013; Tilman and
   Clark, 2014; Vieux et al., 2012) to determine minimum, average, and
   maximum estimated emissions factors per commodity. The emissions
   factors were multiplied by the baseline annual food demand by country
   and commodity to get the carbon dioxide-equivalent values for food
   items over time. Emissions estimates were aggregated by commodity
   types [6] and regions classified by the FAO (2011), and are aligned
   with regions used by Project Drawdown.

   FAO regional estimates of food loss and wastage by commodity types
   across the supply chain stages were applied to aggregated emissions
   values associated with regional food demand. Emissions reductions were
   calculated based on the incremental adoption of reduced food waste
   according to the Plausible, Drawdown, and Optimum Scenarios, which was
   applied across all stages of the supply chain. Resulting emissions
   reductions were aggregated to represent the total global reduction from
   avoided agricultural production.

   Integration

   Project Drawdown calculated the total reduction in food loss and
   wastage by weight (in million metric tons) by commodity type. It was
   assumed that reduced loss and wastage can be diverted to feed current
   and future undernourished populations. Diverted tonnage of food was
   used as an input in the Project Drawdown Integrated Yield Model, which
   combines all agricultural production models to determine the required
   yield to meet the estimated food and bio-based product demand on an
   annual basis. Results from all demand-side solutions, i.e. reduced food
   waste and plant-rich diet, determine the need for land conversion to
   cropland and grassland in order to meet future food demand. Emissions
   reductions associated with land conversion were applied to both reduced
   food waste and plant-rich diet according to the proportion of their
   contribution to diverted food supply.

   In addition, the results of reduced food waste were applied to solution
   models in the Materials Sector that utilize organic municipal solid
   waste.

   Results

   Between 2020 and 2050, the Plausible Scenario projects the total
   cumulative reduction of food loss and wastage to be approximately
   22,160 million metric tons, resulting in the reduction of 70.53
   gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions: 26.17 gigatons due to
   diverted agricultural production, and 44.36 gigatons from avoided land
   conversion.

   The Drawdown Scenario reduces food loss and waste by 32,103 million
   metric tons, and sees a total of 83.02 gigatons of emissions avoided.
   Finally, the Optimum Scenario sees a 41,287 million metric ton
   reduction, resulting in 93.72 gigatons of emissions avoided.

   Discussion

   Food loss and waste has many negative economic and environmental
   impacts. The global economic, environmental, and social cost of food
   wastage is estimated at USD$2.6 trillion, which is nearly equal to the
   GDP of France (FAO, 2014). Food waste generates unnecessary greenhouse
   gas emissions and wastes both water and land, negatively impacting
   natural ecosystems.

   Reducing food loss and waste can also help close the over 60 percent
   gap between food available today and food needed in 2050, thereby
   working toward eliminating hunger. Although solutions at consumer level
   are difficult to implement and hard to measure, they must be pursued at
   regions with high levels of consumer food waste. Food loss and waste
   measurement tools must be developed to standardize the measurement and
   reporting. Food waste reduction targets should be set not only at
   country levels, but also broken down to corporate, supplier, and
   consumer levels. Incentives for waste reduction should be designed and
   provided to influence behavior change. Reducing food waste is a big
   physical problem. But it has widespread benefits for the economy, the
   environment, society, and human health.

Food

Reduced Food Waste

   This is the back end of a processing plant for vegetables in Burscough,
   Lancashire, UK. If you wonder why you have never seen a crooked carrot
   in your local market, commercial or natural, this is why. Vegetables
   are ruthlessly sorted to conform to “quality standards” set by the food
   chain, and this is the result. Some is carted off to piggeries, some as
   you can see is already rotting in the water.

   A third of the food raised or prepared does not make it from farm or
   factory to fork. Producing uneaten food squanders a whole host of
   resources—seeds, water, energy, land, fertilizer, hours of labor,
   financial capital—and generates greenhouse gases at every
   stage—including methane when organic matter lands in the global rubbish
   bin. The food we waste is responsible for roughly 8 percent of global
   emissions.

   Losing food to one waste heap or another is an issue in both high- and
   low-income countries. In places where income is low, wastage is
   generally unintentional and occurs earlier in the supply chain—food
   rots on farms or spoils during storage or distribution. In regions of
   higher income, willful food waste dominates farther along the supply
   chain. Retailers and consumers reject food based on bumps, bruises, and
   coloring, or simply order, buy, and serve too much.

   There are numerous and varied ways to address key waste points. In
   lower-income countries, improving infrastructure for storage,
   processing, and transportation is essential. In higher-income regions,
   major interventions are needed at the retail and consumer levels.
   National food-waste targets and policies can encourage widespread
   change. Beyond addressing emissions, these efforts can also help to
   meet future food demand.

   Global cost and savings data too variable to be determined
   Impact: After taking into account the adoption of plant-rich diets, if
   50 percent of food waste is reduced by 2050, avoided emissions could be
   equal to 26.2 gigatons of carbon dioxide. Reducing waste also avoids
   the deforestation for additional farmland, preventing 44.4 gigatons of
   additional emissions. We used forecasts of regional waste estimated
   from farm to household. This data shows that up to 35 percent of food
   in high-income economies is thrown out by consumers; in low-income
   economies, however, relatively little is wasted at the household level.

Technical Summary

   Reduced Food Waste

   Project Drawdown defines reduced food waste as: minimizing food loss
   and wastage from all stages of production, distribution, retail, and
   consumption. This solution replaces current reported trends in food
   waste by region.

   Estimates suggest that 30–40 percent of all food produced worldwide is
   wasted across the supply chain (Smith, P. et al., 2014). When food is
   wasted, all the energy, resources, and money that went into producing,
   processing, packaging, and transporting it are wasted too. The further
   down the supply chain the food gets before it is thrown out, the more
   resources are wasted to get it to that stage. If measures are taken to
   reduce food waste by improving storage and transport systems,
   generating public awareness, and changing consumer behavior, this
   solution could lead to substantial reductions in waste and carbon
   emissions.

   Methodology

   To evaluate the impact of reduced food waste, an independent model was
   created outside Drawdown’s core model framework to project food
   consumption and waste from 2020-2050. This was required due to the
   complexity of estimating country- and regional-scale food consumption
   and waste trends based on reported commodity types along the supply
   chain.

   Total Addressable Market

   The global market for reduced food waste is defined as the total demand
   for food, based on estimated kilocalories supplied per year for
   consumption by the world’s population. The baseline food consumption is
   projected for all countries up to 2060 in kilocalories per capita per
   year, using data compiled by the Food and Agriculture Organization
   (FAO) for the year 2013. [1] Future consumption is forecasted using
   growth factors from Alexandratos et al. (2012), which reflect projected
   dietary changes. [2]

   Total food loss and wastage is calculated according to regional
   estimates of waste generated at each supply chain stage [3] (FAO,
   2011), applied to aggregated country-level food demand by commodity
   type. Current adoption [4] of reduced food waste is considered to be
   zero percent.

   Adoption Scenarios [5]

   Impacts of increased adoption of reduced food waste from 2020-2050 were
   generated based on three growth scenarios, which were assessed in
   comparison to a Reference Scenario where the solution’s market share is
   fixed at the current levels.

   Adoption scenarios in this model grow linearly over time starting from
   the base year of 2014, and are considered “complete” in 2050. Linear
   growth trends were chosen because of the lack of country or regional
   data; additional behavioral research at more granular scales can reveal
   more representative adoption estimates.

   For reduced food waste, three scenarios were developed:
     * Plausible Scenario: This scenario assumes that a 50 percent
       reduction in total global food loss and wastage will be achieved by
       2050.
     * Drawdown Scenario: In this scenario, a 75 percent reduction in
       total global food loss and wastage by 2050 is modeled.
     * Optimum Scenario: Aligned with the Zero Hunger Challenge of
       eliminating food loss and wastage, this scenario assesses the
       impacts of a 100 percent reduction in total global food loss and
       wastage.

   Emissions Model

   To estimate emissions, commodity-specific carbon dioxide-equivalent
   per-calorie values were drawn from several sources (see Audsley et al.,
   2010; Heller and Keoleian, 2014; Hoolohan et al., 2013; Tilman and
   Clark, 2014; Vieux et al., 2012) to determine minimum, average, and
   maximum estimated emissions factors per commodity. The emissions
   factors were multiplied by the baseline annual food demand by country
   and commodity to get the carbon dioxide-equivalent values for food
   items over time. Emissions estimates were aggregated by commodity
   types [6] and regions classified by the FAO (2011), and are aligned
   with regions used by Project Drawdown.

   FAO regional estimates of food loss and wastage by commodity types
   across the supply chain stages were applied to aggregated emissions
   values associated with regional food demand. Emissions reductions were
   calculated based on the incremental adoption of reduced food waste
   according to the Plausible, Drawdown, and Optimum Scenarios, which was
   applied across all stages of the supply chain. Resulting emissions
   reductions were aggregated to represent the total global reduction from
   avoided agricultural production.

   Integration

   Project Drawdown calculated the total reduction in food loss and
   wastage by weight (in million metric tons) by commodity type. It was
   assumed that reduced loss and wastage can be diverted to feed current
   and future undernourished populations. Diverted tonnage of food was
   used as an input in the Project Drawdown Integrated Yield Model, which
   combines all agricultural production models to determine the required
   yield to meet the estimated food and bio-based product demand on an
   annual basis. Results from all demand-side solutions, i.e. reduced food
   waste and plant-rich diet, determine the need for land conversion to
   cropland and grassland in order to meet future food demand. Emissions
   reductions associated with land conversion were applied to both reduced
   food waste and plant-rich diet according to the proportion of their
   contribution to diverted food supply.

   In addition, the results of reduced food waste were applied to solution
   models in the Materials Sector that utilize organic municipal solid
   waste.

   Results

   Between 2020 and 2050, the Plausible Scenario projects the total
   cumulative reduction of food loss and wastage to be approximately
   22,160 million metric tons, resulting in the reduction of 70.53
   gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions: 26.17 gigatons due to
   diverted agricultural production, and 44.36 gigatons from avoided land
   conversion.

   The Drawdown Scenario reduces food loss and waste by 32,103 million
   metric tons, and sees a total of 83.02 gigatons of emissions avoided.
   Finally, the Optimum Scenario sees a 41,287 million metric ton
   reduction, resulting in 93.72 gigatons of emissions avoided.

   Discussion

   Food loss and waste has many negative economic and environmental
   impacts. The global economic, environmental, and social cost of food
   wastage is estimated at USD$2.6 trillion, which is nearly equal to the
   GDP of France (FAO, 2014). Food waste generates unnecessary greenhouse
   gas emissions and wastes both water and land, negatively impacting
   natural ecosystems.

   Reducing food loss and waste can also help close the over 60 percent
   gap between food available today and food needed in 2050, thereby
   working toward eliminating hunger. Although solutions at consumer level
   are difficult to implement and hard to measure, they must be pursued at
   regions with high levels of consumer food waste. Food loss and waste
   measurement tools must be developed to standardize the measurement and
   reporting. Food waste reduction targets should be set not only at
   country levels, but also broken down to corporate, supplier, and
   consumer levels. Incentives for waste reduction should be designed and
   provided to influence behavior change. Reducing food waste is a big
   physical problem. But it has widespread benefits for the economy, the
   environment, society, and human health.

   [2] The projected dietary changes show significant impacts for
   countries like India and China, whose populations are expected to
   demand more carbon-intensive foods over the next 30 years.

   [3] Supply chain stages are defined as: agricultural production,
   postharvest handling and storage, processing, packaging, distribution,
   and consumption.

   [4] Current adoption is defined as the amount of functional demand
   supplied by the solution in the base year of study. This study uses
   2014 as the base year due to the availability of global adoption data
   for all Project Drawdown solutions evaluated.

   Plant-Rich Diet
   Meat-centric diets come with a steep climate price tag: one-fifth of
   global emissions. Plant-rich diets dramatically reduce emissions and
   rates of chronic disease.
   Food
   Conservation Agriculture
   Conservation agriculture avoids tilling and employs cover crops and
   crop rotation. By protecting the soil, it makes land more resilient and
   sequesters carbon.
   Buildings and Cities
   Landfill Methane
   Landfills are a top source of methane emissions. Instead, landfill
   methane can be captured, preventing emissions, and used as a fairly
   clean energy source.
   Food
   Improved Rice Cultivation
   Flooded rice paddies produce large quantities of methane—10 percent of
   agricultural emissions. Techniques exist to reduce methane, while
   improving production and sequestering carbon.
