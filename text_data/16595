Rustic Harvest Gold Fall Tablescape with Black & White Accents

   Fall is definitely creeping in around here in Colorado. The leaves are
   starting to change up in the mountains and they are dropping off the
   trees here. Today, I am excited to share our new Rustic Harvest Gold
   Fall Tablescape that I will easily transition for Halloween next (more
   on that later!).

Warm and Cozy Fall Coffee Table Styling

   When the colors and temperatures start changing outside, it is usually
   time for new changes inside. This change of season brings on my
   favorite holidays of the year and I look forward to decorating for it
   every year. Today, I am sharing my new Warm and Cozy Fall Coffee Table
   Styling in one of our living areas.

Fall Vignette featuring Nuts and Snacks

   As fall approaches, I usually start my decor a little early once the
   kiddos go back to school. It feels like a fresh start to the ‚Äúnew
   normal‚Äù once we get settled back into our regular schedules.

   For our fall decor this year, I started in our Butler‚Äôs Pantry which is
   an area that is utilized daily in our home. Today, I am sharing simple
   Fall Vignette featuring nuts and snacks that I just put together.

Alfresco Wine Dinner Party

   The weather here in Colorado does not quite feel like fall yet.
   However, our son has gone off to college and our daughter has started
   her senior year in high school so it feels like fall is right around
   the corner. To commemorate this new season in our lives, I decided to
   put together an Alfresco Wine Dinner Party for some out of town guests.

Rustic Alfresco Summer Table Setting

   Being able to eat outdoors for so many months of the year is one of my
   most favorite things about living in Colorado. When the afternoon rains
   stay away, we typically eat outside. ‚ÄúAlfresco‚Äù is an Italian term that
   means ‚Äúin the cool (air)‚Äù. Today, I am excited to share a Rustic
   Alfresco Summer Table Setting for a dinner party we recently hosted.

   I am also so happy to be joining an amazing group of women sharing
   their own summer tablescape ideas. I have been following some of these
   ladies since before I started blogging, so it is really fun for me to
   be sharing this hop with them today. The links to their beautiful posts
   are at the bottom of this post.

   Have you ever used table runners as placemats?! I do this a lot and use
   them for both directions...down the table or across. I chose these
   black ones for this Harvest Gold Fall Tablescape because I thought it
   would make it easy to transition this table setting for Halloween next.
   How's that for thinking?! üòâ . Tomorrow, we are headed up to CSU for
   Parent's Weekend so I am super excited to be back on campus with our
   son! I anticipate being very restless tonight!! . . . . .

   When I am putting together a table setting in my dining room, I always
   try to coordinate the decor on my buffet. In this case, it was super
   simple. I just added this potted goldenrod (that matched the garland on
   my table) and one of the same white porcelain pumpkins I used on top of
   each place settings and that was it. You can see all of the details of
   the room linked in my profile. A special side note...the salt and
   pepper vessels belonged to my great-grandmother and are one of my most
   cherished serving pieces!! I just love featuring them! . . . . .

   New post alert! Today, I am excited to share my new Rustic Harvest Gold
   Fall Tablescape. As I was planning this, I also considered how I can
   easily transition this table setting for Halloween. I just love mixing
   gold with black and white! All of the details are linked in my profile.

   Thank goodness today is my husband's birthday because it brought our
   son home from college for the weekend!! So, there is one happy momma
   here! A free dinner out also helped!! Do you bribe your kids with nice
   dinners out to come home?! Fortunately, he does love being home even
   though he doesn't even recognize the changes I have made in the house
   for fall. All is good! . . . . . #homewithholliday

   Hi friends! I have not popped in much over the last week as I have been
   super sick...like 5 full days in bed with a diet of Ziacam, Musinex,
   Hall's cough drops, hot toddies, etc. You know it is bad when you
   constantly crave Vicks Vapor Rub!! My fall snack tray (details linked
   in my profile) has come in handy over the last week since we have had a
   lot of friends and kids through here while I have been flat on my back.
   In the middle of being sick, I just couldn't miss our local blogger's
   @fyiconference that I had been signed up for many months ago. I just
   took a box of tissues, cough drops, etc. and plugged on through and,
   boy, am I glad I did! I will share more on that later. In the meantime,
   I am going back to bed!
