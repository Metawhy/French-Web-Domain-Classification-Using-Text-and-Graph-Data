Contextual, Connected, and Comparative: Proposed Directions for Information
Literacy Scholarship

   Posted on November 19, 2018 by Lisa Janicke Hinchliffe

   [Introductory Note: I had the privilege of serving as the conference
   rapporteur for the ECIL 2018 Conference in Oulu, Finland.  It was an
   honor to be trusted by the conference organizers with this role. Onsite
   I spoke from an outline/notes. Many people asked me to provide a text
   of my remarks and so this is a post-delivery re-construction.]

   ECIL is always a highlight conference. I extend my congratulations to
   the organizers on a successful conference. The labor involved is
   immense.  And, I am grateful not only to our organizers but the
   reviewers, editors, session chairs, etc. as well as the staff of our
   hotels and catering.  I also wish to recognize those in our personal
   and professional lives who contributed to our ability to be here by
   taking on our tasks and responsibilities, at least temporarily, and
   leaving us free to gather together for ECIL. Finally, to all of you who
   presented and/or engaged in formal and informal conversations, thank
   you. And, I beg your forgiveness and patience as I came in and out of
   your sessions in order to attempt to sample across the conference as
   broadly as possible in preparing these remarks.

   In here welcoming remarks, Sonja reminded us of the theme of this
   conference – our focus on information literacy in everyday life. And,
   she exhorted us to meet each other and “EXCHANGE IDEAS!”

   I think we have succeeded.

   A concept that has shaped my own work as a librarian educator for the
   past decade is the notion of a community of practice. A community of
   practice is a group of people who share a concern or a passion for
   something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact
   regularly and reflects the fundamentally social nature of human
   learning.

   Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger first articulated this concept in their
   book Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation, which
   Wenger then extended in his 1998 work Communities of Practice:
   Learning, Meaning, and Identity.

   A few years ago I had the great privilege of being coached by Etienne
   and his partner Beverly Wenger-Trayner on design principles for
   fostering a community of practice. In that experience I came to
   understand the depth of this seemingly simple concept.

   So, I’ll begin by observing how ECIL is maturing as a community of
   practice. There are clearly emerging roles, culture, methods,
   practices, rules, traditions, etc. For example, there will always be
   dancing!

   ECIL has so far avoided the negative aspects that can develop in a
   community of practice, the setting up of barriers to keep people out.
   I am proud to be a member of this community.

   As I prepared these remarks, I found my thoughts and reflections
   telescoping in and out. I was inspired in part by the artwork in the
   hallway outside this room. If you haven’t yet noticed, take a look. At
   first you will see silhouettes of individuals and groups. But, come
   closer and the components come into focus. The images are made up of
   overlapping printed words – works like excitement, spirit, vitality,
   and imagination. So appropriate for this ECIL gathering!
     __________________________________________________________________

   As I reflected closely on this ECIL 2018 conference in particular, I
   noted that the methodological aspect of our investigations into
   information literacy research and practice is strengthening
   tremendously. I also noted the widening breadth of considerations,
   particularly highlighted and brought to the foreground by the theme of
   this conference.

   I’ll personally be taking with me the taxonomy that was introduced in
   the keynote address by Frans Mäyrä: functional literacy, critical
   literacy, and creative literacy. This taxonomy is a lens through which
   we can consider many of the things spoken about at this conference.

   I’m also pleased to note the increased attention to disadvantaged and
   oppressed peoples and their information literacy needs and practices.
   Many papers took as their starting point a focus on a particular group
   of people. This point is the core of what I would challenge us to
   pursue next in the collective deepening of our scholarship. I want to
   see us build from our stronger methodological base to more
   sophisticated analysis of the diversity within our populations.  I
   would challenge us to look carefully at the subpopulations within our
   studies and bring an intersectional lens to our work.

   Similarly, I believe we need to improve our measures of the information
   environments that are the contexts of information literacy. Currently
   the information environment is typically treated as a constant and
   uniform variable even though we easily can see that it is not. We also
   cannot – and should not – assume a uniformity of experiences of the
   information environment within a given community.

   We need to look not only at those populations that are socially
   identified as disadvantaged but also at those whose oppression exists
   within the larger context, hidden by systemic factors – those
   structural factors that blind us but which our research approaches
   could reveal. This leads me to my belief that in doing so we would find
   power in avoiding deficit models and theories of information literacy
   and instead using models of capabilities, capacities, and participatory
   inquiry methods. In sum, I am putting forth that we should adopt an
   epistemology of inclusion, equity, and social justice.

   So, as I come to a close, let me share three words that I hope will
   guide our next stage of growth as this information literacy scholarship
   community of practice.

   Contextual – We must understand information literacy in context. In
   doing so, we will recognize and reveal the heterogeneity of that
   context and thus of the variety of information literacy experiences and
   practices in our communities.

   Connected – I’d like to consider this on multiple levels. First, at the
   individual level I think we need to connect information literacy across
   the various spheres of individual experience and across the lifespan.
   E.g., respectively, how does information literacy in the workplace
   connect with information literacy in the home or in civic life? And,
   what are the long-term implications of differential early experiences
   with information literacy or are there connections between life events
   and propensity toward lifelong information literacy practices?

   Second, we should consider connections at the community or group level.
   What are the impacts of peers and social connections on information
   literacy skill development? Also, what is the collective impact of
   multiple information literacy organizations functioning in a particular
   community? How do these organizations create an information literacy
   network or social fabric for our communities? How does a collective of
   organizations function compared to that of a single organization? As a
   side note, I hope to see some of you in Kaunas, Lithuania in October
   for the UNESCO GAPMIL Conference, which has as its theme this year
   “media and information literate cities” and thus encourages this
   community lens perspective.

   Comparative – Finally, I’d like to encourage us to move towards more
   comparative frameworks in our research studies. At the micro level, for
   example, detailed comparisons of instructional practices could help us
   develop more strategic information literacy interventions. We know that
   many practices are effective. What we need to ask now is not just is
   x-practice effective or is y-practice effective but is x-practice or
   y-practice more effective for what purpose in which settings? Likewise,
   at a more macro level, comparative city, country, or regional studies
   on information literacy policy, frameworks, and practices could help us
   understand the interplay between information and social policy and
   legal regimes and options for information literacy programs.

   I will leave you with a final thought as we return to our homes and
   look forward to our re-convening at ECIL2020. I was reminded today of
   the concept of “the prepared mind” – the mindset that is the capacity
   to benefit from what one encounters. As we leave this place and each
   other, we leave with a newly prepared mind.  We are poised to benefit
   in new ways from what we encounter. We came together to exchange ideas.
   We leave inspired, challenged, and nourished in our information
   literacy work.  Thank you.

Doctoral Forum

   Posted on June 13, 2018 by ECIL

   The doctoral forum of the European Conference on Information Literacy
   2018 will have a novel concept with a focus in scientific publishing.
   We want to extend the invitation to all doctoral candidates attending
   the conference. In other words, a participant does not have to have
   submitted a paper to the doctoral forum to participate.

   The doctoral forum will be held on the final day of the conference
   (Thursday 27th of September). The schedule has not yet been planned in
   detail, but we are happy to inform you that Professor Peter Bath
   (University of Sheffield, UK) and Dr Emma Coonan (Anglia Ruskin
   University, UK) have agreed to speak in the doctoral forum. In
   addition, Professor Karen E. Fisher (University of Washington, US) as
   well as other scholars will act as mentors in the forum.

   We have asked scholars to share their experiences on scientific
   publishing as researchers, reviewers, and editors. The doctoral
   candidates will have an active role in the forum but will not be
   required to prepare full presentations or papers.

   At this point, we would ask those doctoral candidates interested in
   participating to contact the organising committee. This way we can
   consider this in the general schedule.

   Note that the early bird registration of ECIL conference will close on
   the 22th of June.

Gala dinner

   Posted on May 17, 2018 by ECIL

   NOTE! We are sorry to inform that the gala dinner is fully booked. We
   apologise for the inconvenience!

   The gala dinner will take place in the old wooden house of Oulu YMCA
   located next to Franzén park and Oulu Cathedral.

   Oulu YMCA “Ynninkulma” still stands as proud as on the year of 1825,
   when it was built. This old house has gathered a beautiful patina over
   the years and seen the city grow as well as witnessed the city’s role
   as the governmental capital of the province. The oldest of the three
   vaults on the grounds was built in the middle of the 17th century, so
   you can certainly feel the history of Oulu.

Excursions

   Posted on May 8, 2018 by ECIL

   Lively Oulu, the pearl of Fennoscandia, is a gateway to urban culture
   as well as to the unique nature of the North. This is where modern
   business meets northern peace and exoticism. Founded in 1605 by King
   Charles IX of Sweden, Oulu charms with its light and lushness and has
   an interesting history.

   The former salmon and tar capital has evolved into a major high-tech
   centre, particularly in IT and wellness technology. The university has
   the world’s first 5G test network and the city itself has been
   nominated as the most intelligent community in Europe–twice. The city
   has one of the youngest populations in Europe and it is bound to do big
   things also in the future.

   The word “Oulu” is probably derived from the Sámi word for “flood
   water” and quite fittingly, the city has a seaside feel to it. The
   archipelago nature is just around the corner and beautiful parks are
   all around. In the fall, the whole city takes a tint of red, yellow and
   brown called “ruska”, as the ubiquitous trees and bushes change colour
   in the anticipation of winter.

   We hope you will take some time to become acquainted with the city of
   Oulu. The best way to do that is to take part in some of our exciting
   excursions!

   This day trip takes you to three interesting and beautiful natural
   sites in the outskirts of Oulu.

   First, the Kierikki Stone Age Centre takes you back in time thousands
   of years into the distant past of the North. The Kierikki Centre is
   located along the Iijoki river on a Stone Age dwelling site that has
   been studied since the 1960s.

   The Kierikki Centre’s permanent exhibition explores local and regional
   pre-history and life in the Stone Age in a fascinating and entertaining
   way. It features the greatest finds of the excavation, including a
   mammoth’s molar tooth that is 35,000 years old! The road to the Stone
   Age village is a wide boardwalk with beautiful views to the nearby
   Iijoki river and the archaeological excavation is open to the public in
   summer. You might find something really old!

   The trip also takes you to the Panuma village located in the middle of
   wilderness, one of the oldest villages of reindeer husbandry in the
   southern reindeer management area. No less than seven generations have
   already been practising reindeer husbandry at Poro-Panuma. You will see
   reindeer, reindeer and reindeer at the wilderness farm so make sure to
   charge your cameras!

   Lastly, you will spend a wonderful afternoon in Koiteli, an island

   Ranua Zoo, Arktikum & Santa Claus Village^3

   This tour is an arctic one! We will take you to Lapland, to the Ranua
   Zoo, to experience the wild arctic. The Ranua Wildlife Park specialises
   in arctic and northern animal species. The spacious animal fencings are
   located in the midst of northern conifer forests, the natural habitat
   of most of the animals.

   You can see the only polar bears living in Finland, as well as 50 other
   arctic and northern animal species, 200 individuals, altogether. Say hi
   to arctic foxes, huge moose, musk oxen, and Venus the polar bear and
   her cub Sisu.

   Ranua Zoo

   From Ranua, we journey north to Arktikum, the science centre and museum
   that lets you experience northern nature, culture and history up close.
   Finland’s northernmost and largest province, Lapland has been home to
   permanent settlements and a broad network of northern peoples for
   thousands of years. The exhibitions illustrate the history of Lapland,
   its cultures, nature, and other contemporary themes. Familiarize
   yourself with the Lapland War, the occupations and livelihoods in the
   north, the unique natural characteristics, reindeer herding, as well as
   the Sámi people.

   Finally, we will take you all the way to the Arctic Circle to meet none
   other than Santa Claus at the official Santa Claus village. You can
   take a photo with the one and only Santa and let him know what you want
   for Christmas well in advance. You will get to cross the Arctic Circle,

   the magic time of elves and reindeer. Lapland might steal your heart,
