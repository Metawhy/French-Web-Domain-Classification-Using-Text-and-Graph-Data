From exploration to preservationPerpetual Planet

A living laboratory

   For the founder of Rolex, Hans Wilsdorf, the world was like a living
   laboratory. He began to use it as a testing ground for his watches from
   the 1930s, sending them to the most extreme locations, supporting
   explorers who ventured into the unknown. But the world has changed.
   As the 21st century unfolds, exploration for pure discovery has given
   way to exploration as a means to preserve the natural world. Rolex
   continues the legacy of its founder, supporting the explorers of today
   on their new mission: to make the planet perpetual.

Everest

   Rolex watches have taken part in some of humanity’s greatest
   adventures. One such occasion was the 1953 expedition to Everest, led
   by Sir John Hunt, which saw Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay
   become the first to summit the world’s highest mountain. The same year,
   to honour this historic exploit, Rolex officially launched the Explorer
   model.

Trieste

   In 1960 a milestone for deep-sea exploration was established with an
   experimental Rolex watch, the Deep Sea Special. It was attached to the
   exterior of the bathyscaphe Trieste, piloted by Swiss oceanographer
   Jacques Piccard and American Navy Lieutenant Don Walsh descended to a
   then record depth of 10,916 metres in the Mariana Trench.

Deepsea Challenge

   In 2012, film-maker and explorer James Cameron made the first solo dive
   to the deepest part of the oceans, the Mariana Trench. He navigated a
   specially designed DEEPSEA CHALLENGER submersible to a depth of 10, 908
   metres (35,787 feet). Attached to the outside of the hull was an
   experimental Rolex Deepsea Challenge watch that functioned perfectly
   under extreme pressure.

Under the Pole

   Deepsea Under the Pole by Rolex, was a pioneering expedition undertaken
   in 2010 to learn more about the submerged side the Arctic. Of all the
   equipment used, only the Rolex Deepsea watches continued to function
   properly during the entire expedition. It was succeeded by Under The
   Pole III in 2017, exploring the water from the Arctic to the Antarctic,
   to better understand climate equilibrium, bioluminescence, improve
   underwater exploration techniques and encourage future generations to
   do the same.

Perpetual Planet

   For nearly a century, Rolex has supported pioneering explorers, pushing
   back the boundaries of human endeavour. With the Perpetual Planet
   campaign, launched in 2019, Rolex is committed for the long term to
   support the explorers in their quest to protect the environment.
   To start with, this commitment focuses on the Rolex Awards for
   Enterprise and partnerships with the National Geographic Society and
   Sylvia Earle’s Mission Blue initiative. But that is just the beginning.

National Geographic

   Rolex and National Geographic have been partners in exploration since
   1954. Through Perpetual Planet Extreme Expeditions, there is the
   opportunity to fuse the power of science, the fascination for discovery
   and the enthralment of storytelling to find and share fresh insights
   into a changing world.

   inspiring individuals, through the Rolex Awards for Enterprise. More
   than 140 Laureates have achieved outstanding feats of discovery,
   commitment and renewal in the fields of science, exploration, health,

Mission blue

   An internationally renowned oceanographer and long-standing Rolex
   Testimonee Dr Sylvia Earle is a pioneer of the deep. After more than 50
   years of underwater exploration, she is a committed advocate of the
   oceans and their vulnerable ecosystems. Her initiative Mission Blue is
   igniting public support to safeguard the world’s oceans. Earle’s
   relationship with Rolex started in 1970, when she received her first
   Rolex.
