Snopes.com Participates in Facebook’s Effort to Combat Hoaxes, Fake News

Facebook announced a plan to address the circulation of false information via
social media with the help of third-party fact checkers, including
snopes.com.

   snopes
     * Published 30 November 2016

   The growing proliferation of fake news and other misinformation via
   social media over the past few years has prompted a public outcry for
   better methods of discerning and coping with the spread of falsehoods —
   an effort which has long been central to our mission as the oldest and
   most trusted fact-checking web site on the Internet.

   Since our inception in 1995, snopes.com has been dedicated to providing
   accurate, impartial analyses of rumors, hoaxes, fake news, propaganda,
   and whatever other forms false information may take.

   On 15 December 2016, Facebook announced a new initiative aimed at
   confronting the increasing volume of misinformation online by
   enhancing users’ ability to report questionable posts and providing a
   mechanism by which their accuracy can be evaluated by third-party fact
   checkers and flagged where appropriate as “disputed,” so that social
   media users can learn more and make informed choices before sharing
   them. We have agreed to participate in this experiment alongside other
   well-regarded fact checking sites.

   In doing so, the ownership and editorial staff of snopes.com wish
   to reiterate our commitment to accuracy and impartiality. Our core
   mission will not change. We expect to derive no direct financial
   benefit from this arrangement, nor will we ever relinquish our
   independence as a fact-checking organization. Our goal is to help
   empower Facebook users to better control and enhance their own online
   experience, and we believe that increasing the flow and visibility of
   accurate, vetted information is one of the best ways to do that.

   Most Snopes assignments begin when readers ask us, “Is this true?”
   Those tips launch our fact-checkers on sprints across a vast range of
   political, scientific, legal, historical, and visual information. We
   investigate as thoroughly and quickly as possible and relay what we
   learn. Then another question arrives, and the race starts again.

   We do this work every day at no cost to you, but it is far from free to

Snopes.com Participates in Facebook’s Effort to Combat Hoaxes, Fake News

Facebook announced a plan to address the circulation of false information via
social media with the help of third-party fact checkers, including
snopes.com.

   snopes
     * Published 30 November 2016

   The growing proliferation of fake news and other misinformation via
   social media over the past few years has prompted a public outcry for
   better methods of discerning and coping with the spread of falsehoods —
   an effort which has long been central to our mission as the oldest and
   most trusted fact-checking web site on the Internet.

   Since our inception in 1995, snopes.com has been dedicated to providing
   accurate, impartial analyses of rumors, hoaxes, fake news, propaganda,
   and whatever other forms false information may take.

   On 15 December 2016, Facebook announced a new initiative aimed at
   confronting the increasing volume of misinformation online by
   enhancing users’ ability to report questionable posts and providing a
   mechanism by which their accuracy can be evaluated by third-party fact
   checkers and flagged where appropriate as “disputed,” so that social
   media users can learn more and make informed choices before sharing
   them. We have agreed to participate in this experiment alongside other
   well-regarded fact checking sites.

   In doing so, the ownership and editorial staff of snopes.com wish
   to reiterate our commitment to accuracy and impartiality. Our core
   mission will not change. We expect to derive no direct financial
   benefit from this arrangement, nor will we ever relinquish our
   independence as a fact-checking organization. Our goal is to help
   empower Facebook users to better control and enhance their own online
   experience, and we believe that increasing the flow and visibility of
   accurate, vetted information is one of the best ways to do that.

   Most Snopes assignments begin when readers ask us, “Is this true?”
   Those tips launch our fact-checkers on sprints across a vast range of

   investigate as thoroughly and quickly as possible and relay what we
   learn. Then another question arrives, and the race starts again.

   We do this work every day at no cost to you, but it is far from free to

Did Physicist Michio Kaku Say HAARP Caused Irma and Harvey?

A 2013 CBS video segment about weather modification was dishonestly reframed
as a clip about Hurricanes Irma and Harvey.

   Kim LaCapria
     * Published 11 September 2017

Claim

   Professor Michio Kaku said Hurricanes Harvey and Irma were caused by
   the United States Government modifying the weather.

Origin

   On 9 September 2017 the web site YourNewsWire.com published an item
   suggesting that theoretical physicist and CBS News contributor Michio
   Kaku had said that the recent hurricanes Harvey and Irma were the
   result of a government research program that shuttered in 2014.

   The article, titled “Top Scientist Tells CBS: HAARP Responsible For
   Recent Hurricanes,” claims that physicist and professor Michio Kaku had
   confessed that the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program, an
   Alaska-based program created to analyze the ionosphere, which has been
   the subject of numerous conspiracy theories, had created the two deadly
   hurricanes:

     World renowned physicist Dr. Michio Kaku made a shocking confession
     on live TV when he admitted that HAARP is responsible for the recent
     spate of hurricanes.

     In an interview aired by CBS, Dr. Kaku admitted that recent
     ‘man-made’ hurricanes have been the result of a government weather
     modification program in which the skies were sprayed with nano
     particles and storms then “activated” through the use of “lasers”.

     In the interview (below), Michio Kaku discusses the history of
     weather modification, before the CBS crew stop him in his tracks.

     The High-Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) was
     created in the early 1990’s as part of an ionospheric research
     program jointly funded by the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, the
     University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the Defense Advanced Research
     Projects Agency (DARPA).

   The claim quickly spread to several conspiracy blogs, YouTube channels,
   and Facebook pages in early September 2017.

   Kaku never said that HAARP was responsible for hurricanes. YouTube
   videos espousing the conspiracy theory splice together misinformation
   about HAARP with an interview Kaku did with CBS News in 2013 in which
   he talked about the possibility of governments one day being able to
   cause rainfall using lasers and other means.

   The description of the official video of the CBS interview read:

     Scientists and researchers may one day be able to manipulate rain
     and lightning using lasers. “CBS This Morning” contributor Michio
     Kaku, a physics professor at City College of New York, talks to
     Charlie Rose and Norah O’Donnell about the potential future of
     weather.

           IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/hm1_TfTgUag?rel=0



   In the video, Kaku also discusses the possibility that governments had
   manipulated weather in the past to cause or prevent rainstorms, and he
   calls the evidence “inconclusive” several times. He said of current
   efforts to manipulate the weather that there was “nothing conclusive …
   [but scientists are] bringing in the laws of physics” and “actually
   using trillion watt lasers” in such experiments. Kaku mentioned
   hurricanes at the end of a list of future theoretical weather
   modification applications:

     … in the laboratory, sure enough they [now] precipitate rain out of
     water vapor … [but] the bad news is if it’s a clear blue sky, it’s
     not gonna do anything at all … outdoor events, and agriculture, and
     flooding, and even hurricanes all can be subject to weather
     modification.

   We reached out to Kaku, who told us “The story is 100% false.”

   Kaku also appeared on CBS in August 2017 to discuss Hurricane Harvey
   and the science behind hurricanes. He did not at any point say that
   HAARP had caused hurricanes.

McDonald’s Exposed for Using Human Meat?

Reports that an Oklahoma City McDonald's outlet was caught with horse meat

Origin

   False rumors about McDonald’s restaurants using worms as filler in
   their hamburgers and true reports of some retail chains being vended
   food products tainted with horse meat due to problems with supplies
   have been the basis for wild (but apparently believable) claims that an
   Oklahoma City McDonald’s outlet was caught with horse meat and human
   meat in their freezers.

   Such claims originated with a 27 March 2014 article published by the
   Huzlers web site:

     First Horse meat, then the mysterious “Pink slime”, Now Human meat?
     A shocking discovery has been made in an Oklahoma City McDonald’s
     meat factory and other McDonald’s meat factories nationwide. Meat
     inspectors reportedly found, what appeared to be, Human meat stored
     in the meat factory freezers of an Oklahoma City meat factory and
     human meat already in trucks right outside the factory ready to be
     shipped to McDonald’s restaurants. Health inspectors immediately
     demanded inspection in various McDonald’s meat factories across the
     country and horrifyingly found human meat in about 90% of the
     factories inspected thus far.

     The USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) has seized
     McDonald’s production and shipping and will call for more meat
     factory inspections and restaurant inspections. The FBI is also
     investigating the factories. FBI agent Lloyd Harrison told Huzler
     reporters “The worst part is that it’s not only human meat, it’s
     child meat. the body parts that were found across the U.S. factories
     were deemed to small to be adult body parts, this is truly
     horrible”.

     The situation brings up many unanswered questions. How long have
     they been using human meat? Where did they get the children from?
     Were they already dead when brought into factories? Investigators
     and Inspectors are currently being deployed for intensive
     investigations all around the U.S.

   However, that McDonald’s article was just a spoof from the Huzlers web
   site, which offers users the ability to “Create your own news prank and
   trick your friends by sharing it” and has a history of publishing
   fabricated news stories (such as one about pop star Justin Bieber‘s
   admitting to being bisexual and one about the 2014 Super Bowl being
   rigged). The Huzlers site also carries a disclaimer on its pages noting
   that “Huzlers.com is a combination of real shocking news and satire
   news to keep its visitors in a state of disbelief” and is listed in our
   article about “5 Fake News Sites to Avoid Sharing.”

   In truth, no part of the McDonald’s operation has been cited for having
   bought, sold, processed, or used either horse meat or human meat (the
   latter of which cannot legally be vended in the U.S.) for food
   purposes.

Did Bill Gates Admit Vaccinations Are Designed So Governments Can Depopulate
the World?

The computer magnate believes that vaccines can be used to reduce childhood
mortality and ultimately reduce population growth through associated social
changes, not as an agent of death.

Origin

   On 21 January 2016, dubious news and conspiracy theory site
   YourNewsWire.com published a story with the headline “Bill Gates Admits
   ‘Vaccines Are Best Way To Depopulate’”. The article opens with
   a damning claim:

     Bill Gates has openly admitted that vaccinations are designed so
     that governments can depopulate the world.

   To support this claim, the site presented a February 2011 clip of Bill
   Gates being interviewed by CNN’s Sanjay Gupta about his foundation’s
   vaccination efforts:

     Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Ten billion dollars over the next 10 years to make
     it “the year of the vaccines.” What does that mean exactly?

     Bill Gates: Over this decade, we believe unbelievable progress can
     be made, in both inventing new vaccines and making sure they get out
     to all the children who need them. […] we only need about six or
     seven more — and then you would have all the tools to reduce
     childhood death, reduce population growth, and everything — the
     stability, the environment — benefits from that.

   To make sure the point was not lost on the reader, YNW repeated the
   “reduce population growth”, emphasized above, numerous times at a
   variety of different playback speeds, as if to suggest this was a slip
   of the tongue revealing some nefarious secret. This narrative is
   reinforced with another video that opens with this text:

     Next are two short excerpts from a recently filmed TED presentation
     (Feb 2010) by none other than Bill “Microsoft” Gates. […] As Gates
     casually addresses the issue [of reducing carbon emissions], he goes
     on to state that one way to accomplish this goal is to reduce the
     global human population.

     In the first clip you will hear him state in plain language that he
     considers VACCINES to be desirable to that end. You will also
     casually hear him promoting HEALTH CARE and REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
     SERVICES, to accomplish that same goal.

     In the second excerpt you will hear Gates again confirming his
     profound affection for vaccines.

   The damming moment, according to YourNewsWire.com, was the
   following statement from Gates:

     First, we’ve got population. The world today has 6.8 billion people.
     That’s headed up to about nine billion. Now, if we do a really great
     job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we
     could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent […].

   The suggestion, hinted at by both of these clips and argued later in
   the article, is that Gates knows vaccines are dangerous — and he is
   using this information to kill children in the developing world to stem
   population growth. In reality, however, Gates’ statements regarding
   vaccines and population growth were neither an accidental slip nor a
   nefarious admission of plans for a new world order.

   As discussed in a 21 November 2011 Forbes cover story profiling the
   Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, reducing population growth has
   always been integral to their stated mission of “improving people’s
   health and giving them the chance to lift themselves out of hunger and
   extreme poverty”:

     In 1997, when he and Melinda first ventured into public health […]
     they focused on birth control, funding a Johns Hopkins effort to use
     computers to help women in the developing world learn about
     contraception. The logic was crisp and Bill Gates-friendly. Health =
     resources ÷ people. And since resources, as Gates noted, are
     relatively fixed, the answer lay in population control.

   As further discussed in this piece, Gates later came to the conclusion
   that birth control was not the best approach to achieve the goal of
   slower population growth, instead realizing that — counterintuitively —
   a reduction in childhood mortality was the best way to limit population
   growth:

     In society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate
     falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate
     follows, and population growth stabilizes. “It goes against common
     sense,” Gates says. Most parents don’t choose to have eight children
     because they want to have big families, it turns out, but because
     they know many of their children will die.

     “If a mother and father know their child is going to live to
     adulthood, they start to naturally reduce their population
     size,” says Melinda.

   This is a point Gates has made repeatedly, and his views were clearly
   articulated in the 2009 Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Annual
   Letter:

     A surprising but critical fact we learned was that reducing the
     number of deaths actually reduces population growth. […] Contrary to
     the Malthusian view that population will grow to the limit of
     however many kids can be fed, in fact parents choose to have enough
     kids to give them a high chance that several will survive to support
     them as they grow old. As the number of kids who survive to
     adulthood goes up, parents can achieve this goal without having as
     many children.

   In other words, Gates is not interested in using vaccines to reduce the
   population by using them as an agent of death or a tool to sterilize
   unsuspecting masses. Rather, Gates is interested in keeping more
   children alive in order to reduce the need for parents to have more
   children, thus limiting the overall population growth rate.

   As evidenced in a 2014 paper in Science that attempted to calculate
   future population growth, not everyone is convinced childhood mortality
   is the smoking gun to quell population growth:

     Among the most robust empirical findings in the literature on
     fertility transitions are that higher contraceptive use and higher
     female education are associated with faster fertility decline. These
     suggest that the projected rapid population growth could be
     moderated by greater investments in family planning programs to
     satisfy the unmet need for contraception and in girls’ education.

   But Gates’ view on childhood mortality contribution to population
   growth is increasingly discussed in the scientific literature and is
   still subject to debate. What is not up to debate are the intentions of
   the Bill and Melinda Gate’s Foundation with regard to vaccines and
   population growth, as articulated by Bill and Melinda Gates in their
   Foundation’s 2017 Annual Letter:

     Melinda: Saving children’s lives is the goal that launched our
     global work. It’s an end in itself. But then we learned it has all
     these other benefits as well. If parents believe their children will
     survive—and if they have the power to time and space their
     pregnancies—they choose to have fewer children.

     Bill: When a mother can choose how many children to have, her
     children are healthier, they’re better nourished, their mental
     capacities are higher—and parents have more time and money to spend
     on each child’s health and schooling. That’s how families and
     countries get out of poverty. This link between saving lives, a
     lower birthrate, and ending poverty was the most important early
     lesson Melinda and I learned about global health.

   This is obviously a far cry from, as YourNewsWire.com puts it, having
   Bill Gates tell us “how we must all consent to a ‘kill the humans’
   strategy, to ‘save the planet’ from the carbon dioxide we make.”
