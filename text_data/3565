The Chinese Army Is Going Full James Bond

   These military autogyros will be used for special forces, search and
   rescue.
   image
   By Kyle Mizokami
   Jan 11, 2016
   image [yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7]

   The Chinese military is putting a little-used aircraft concept to work.
   Looking like something out of the classic James Bond film You Only Live
   Twice, the Hunting Eagle gyrocopter is going into People's Liberation
   Army (PLA) service.

   Developed by Shaanxi Baoji Special Vehicles, the Hunting Eagle is
   expected to operate in the search and rescue, border control,
   reconnaissance, anti-riot, and other roles. It will also be used to
   self-deploy Chinese special forces on missions into enemy territory.

   Gyrocopters are different from helicopters in having an unpowered main
   rotor. A rearward-facing, engine-powered propeller provides thrust, and
   once sufficient speed is gained, the main rotor begins to rotate,
   providing lift. Gyrocopters were actually developed before helicopters,
   which at the time were thought technologically unfeasible.

   Little is known at this time about the Hunting Eagle's performance
   specifications, in particular load carrying capacity and range. The
   Hunting Eagle has been developed in one-, two- and three-man versions.
   Perhaps not surprisingly, there is some grumbling online that the
   Hunting Eagle bears a very strong resemblance to German gyrocopter
   manufacturer MTO's designs.

   Gyrocopters have never really taken off in Western military service,
   with most armed forces preferring the range and payload of full-size
   helicopters.

   Unlike James Bond's "Little Nellie" gyrocopter, which was packed with
   everything from aerial mines to a flamethrower, the Hunting Eagle does
   not appear to have any built-in weaponry. Small and fragile, an
   gyrocopter can't take even the limited punishment a helicopter can and
   should avoid combat if at all possible.

   One photo of the three-man version has a passenger carrying a
   shoulder-fired rocket launcher, but the weapon is likely just being
   transported; firing from his seat, the soldier carrying the rocket
   launcher  would likely fry his co-passengers.

   Here's a YouTube video of the Hunting Eagle strutting its stuff:

10 Ski Tech Breakthroughs Coming to the Mountain

   Just ahead of the Sochi Olympics, the SnowSports Industries America
   trade show in Denver this past weekend saw the debut of some incredible
   technology. Some of it is strictly for Olympians, but here are a few
   you'll be able to get your hands on.

   Uvex Variotronic Goggles
   Price: $499
   We saw a lot of goggle tech at this show, including one with a heads-up
   display, but this Uvex is the first-ever goggle to convert the lens
   into an LCD—something previously confined to military use. In the
   future, LCD goggles may allow for the embedding of onscreen
   information, but for now Uvex is using it to auto-tint the lens color
   faster than any other technology could. This is particularly useful in
   mixed light, when a skiier might move from sun to shade or from fog
   into piercing sunshine. Pro downhillers will likely be the first to
   make full use of the Variotronic lenses.
   The LCD system requires only a simple USB charge. But this goggle won't
   be cheap or even common: Uvex says it plans to build just 500 units to
   start, but hopes to expand production within the year.

   K2 Route Helmet
   Price: $150
   A day of skiing in a hefty lid can be uncomfortable. But at 320 grams,
   K2's new Route, a sandwich of EPS foam and a polycarbonate shell, may
   be the lightest snow helmet on the market. Another major impediment to
   helmet use is heat—many of them simply don't breathe all that well. So
   K2 focused on maximum venting: To trap heat in the cold, they created
   what's known as PowFly, essentially a wind-blocking membrane that fits
   over the top. The helmet is certified for both skiing and snowboarding,
   as well as cycling.

   Black Diamond Jetforce Avalanche Airbags
   Price: $1000
   Most avalanche airbag systems rely on the same compressed-air tank
   systems pioneered in diving. While this is an incredible lifesaving
   technology, It's illegal to fly with the tanks, so traveling
   backcountry skiers have had to ship tanks or buy them locally. Plus,
   they're a one-shot deal: If you get caught in an avalanche and blow the
   tank high up on a run but need the protection farther down the
   mountain, you're out of luck.
   Black Diamond and co-brand POC now have a better system. It's like a
   turbocharged Shop-Vac motor running in reverse, powered by a
   lithium-ion battery, and inflates the airbag within 3 seconds (the same
   as a compressed-air system). The Jetforce design has four inflations
   per charge, and holds the bags open longer. After you fire the airbag,
   the blower motor keeps filling the bag for 3 minutes, which can
   continue to protect you in the event of further slides. Then it
   reverses the motor, deflating the balloon. The reason: If you've been
   buried, this creates a void in the snow, increasing the potential
   you'll be dug out alive.

   Black Diamond Ion Headlamp
   Price: $25
   Small headlamps aren't uncommon, but they tend to be relatively
   expensive and don't have a full feature set. This affordable set has an
   output of 80 lumens and uses easy-to-find AAA batteries. It has
   touch-sensitive controls for dimming, flashing, and brightness
   functions, and there's a red LED mode to prevent damage to night
   vision. It also has a ratcheting tilt function, often found in larger,
   heavier LED headlamps.

   FootBalance Race Heat Footbed
   Price: $79
   Custom-molded footbeds are common in snow sports (not to mention in
   cycling and running), and the same goes for heated footbeds.
   FootBalance's new Race Heat system combines the two ideas so buyers get
   a customized orthotic insole threaded via a wiring harness to a battery
   pack made by Therm-ic (a common aftermarket heated-insole brand).
   Beyond skiing and snowboarding, FootBalance has seen interest among
   winter bike commuters and people who have to work outdoors in the cold
   and need additional support as well.

   Sony HDR-AS100V
   Price: $300
   Yes, this action camera debuted at CES last month. But trade shows like
   SIA are seeing more and more GoPro competitors because people are
   buying action cams not at electronics stores but at sporting goods
   stores, since the athletic community is the target market. Sony is
   seeking to carve out its place with features like the ability to
   capture super-slo-mo (240 frames per second) and a rugged, splash-proof
   body that doesn't require a case. And what Sony calls the "broadcast
   quality" XAVC S codec developed for HD has now migrated from the
   camcorder market to the tiny action-cam format. Maximum wide angle is
   170 degrees, and the sensor size is an impressive 18 megapixels.
   Available in March.

   Patagonia Nano Air Hoodie
   Price: $249
   If you've ever worn a typical fleece for athletic activities, then you
   know the drill: It can get very hot when you're working hard, but it
   lets in too much air when the wind is blowing. Wear a synthetic or down
   puffy instead and there isn't enough air permeability to prevent sweat
   buildup. The Nano Air was designed to have more air permeability, but
   not as much as a typical fleece. It's made with four-way-stretch for
   easier freedom of movement as well, and a DWR (durable water repellent)
   finish adds some wind and water resistance, and includes rip-stop to
   prevent tears.

   Salomon QBC Lab Ski
   Price: $799
   Ultralight skis are the new normal, with carbon fiber allowing for
   lightness as well as stiffness. The downside is that skis like this can
   be noisy, with a lot of vibration on rougher snow. Although there are a
   variety of approaches to quelling that noise, QBC Lab's design is one
   of the most novel. Flax linen is added to the construction, essentially
   putting a blanket atop the carbon. And while $799 isn't cheap, normal
   carbon skis tend to run north of $1000.

   Smith Optics Archive Collection
   Price: $80 and up
   If you're into retro looks, you'll dig Smith's revisiting of some of
   its iconic shapes from the brand's history. The retro-redux frames are
   made from cellulose, as they were back in the day, although for
   safety's sake the lens tech is updated to modern carbonic materials and
   protection grades (UVA-B shielding and the like). The multiple lines
   include revisits to 1988, 1991, and 1993 vintages, with multiple styles
   in each set.

   Dynafit RC1 Boot
   Price: $2100
   Randonnee is the sport of racing uphill and skiing back down. It's a
   huge deal in Europe, and it's also pushing the arms race of technology
   within standard downhill, where lighter weight is all the rage. We may
   not see anything this radical in alpine for a while yet, however—the
   RC1 is an insanely lightweight all-carbon-shell randonnee boot
   hand-constructed in Europe. There's minimal retention or frills, and it
   costs an eye-bleeding $2100. But if your aim is pushing new boundaries,
   there's no question this boot does that.

The Chinese Army Is Going Full James Bond

   These military autogyros will be used for special forces, search and
   rescue.
   image
   By Kyle Mizokami
   Jan 11, 2016
   image [yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7]

   The Chinese military is putting a little-used aircraft concept to work.
   Looking like something out of the classic James Bond film You Only Live
   Twice, the Hunting Eagle gyrocopter is going into People's Liberation
   Army (PLA) service.

   Developed by Shaanxi Baoji Special Vehicles, the Hunting Eagle is
   expected to operate in the search and rescue, border control,
   reconnaissance, anti-riot, and other roles. It will also be used to
   self-deploy Chinese special forces on missions into enemy territory.

   Gyrocopters are different from helicopters in having an unpowered main
   rotor. A rearward-facing, engine-powered propeller provides thrust, and
   once sufficient speed is gained, the main rotor begins to rotate,
   providing lift. Gyrocopters were actually developed before helicopters,
   which at the time were thought technologically unfeasible.

   Little is known at this time about the Hunting Eagle's performance
   specifications, in particular load carrying capacity and range. The
   Hunting Eagle has been developed in one-, two- and three-man versions.
   Perhaps not surprisingly, there is some grumbling online that the
   Hunting Eagle bears a very strong resemblance to German gyrocopter
   manufacturer MTO's designs.

   Gyrocopters have never really taken off in Western military service,
   with most armed forces preferring the range and payload of full-size
   helicopters.

   Unlike James Bond's "Little Nellie" gyrocopter, which was packed with
   everything from aerial mines to a flamethrower, the Hunting Eagle does
   not appear to have any built-in weaponry. Small and fragile, an
   gyrocopter can't take even the limited punishment a helicopter can and
   should avoid combat if at all possible.

   One photo of the three-man version has a passenger carrying a
   shoulder-fired rocket launcher, but the weapon is likely just being
   transported; firing from his seat, the soldier carrying the rocket
   launcher  would likely fry his co-passengers.

   Here's a YouTube video of the Hunting Eagle strutting its stuff:

10 Ski Tech Breakthroughs Coming to the Mountain

   Just ahead of the Sochi Olympics, the SnowSports Industries America
   trade show in Denver this past weekend saw the debut of some incredible
   technology. Some of it is strictly for Olympians, but here are a few
   you'll be able to get your hands on.

   Uvex Variotronic Goggles
   Price: $499
   We saw a lot of goggle tech at this show, including one with a heads-up
   display, but this Uvex is the first-ever goggle to convert the lens
   into an LCD—something previously confined to military use. In the
   future, LCD goggles may allow for the embedding of onscreen
   information, but for now Uvex is using it to auto-tint the lens color
   faster than any other technology could. This is particularly useful in
   mixed light, when a skiier might move from sun to shade or from fog
   into piercing sunshine. Pro downhillers will likely be the first to
   make full use of the Variotronic lenses.
   The LCD system requires only a simple USB charge. But this goggle won't
   be cheap or even common: Uvex says it plans to build just 500 units to
   start, but hopes to expand production within the year.

   K2 Route Helmet
   Price: $150
   A day of skiing in a hefty lid can be uncomfortable. But at 320 grams,
   K2's new Route, a sandwich of EPS foam and a polycarbonate shell, may
   be the lightest snow helmet on the market. Another major impediment to
   helmet use is heat—many of them simply don't breathe all that well. So
   K2 focused on maximum venting: To trap heat in the cold, they created
   what's known as PowFly, essentially a wind-blocking membrane that fits
   over the top. The helmet is certified for both skiing and snowboarding,
   as well as cycling.

   Black Diamond Jetforce Avalanche Airbags
   Price: $1000
   Most avalanche airbag systems rely on the same compressed-air tank
   systems pioneered in diving. While this is an incredible lifesaving
   technology, It's illegal to fly with the tanks, so traveling
   backcountry skiers have had to ship tanks or buy them locally. Plus,
   they're a one-shot deal: If you get caught in an avalanche and blow the
   tank high up on a run but need the protection farther down the
   mountain, you're out of luck.
   Black Diamond and co-brand POC now have a better system. It's like a
   turbocharged Shop-Vac motor running in reverse, powered by a
   lithium-ion battery, and inflates the airbag within 3 seconds (the same
   as a compressed-air system). The Jetforce design has four inflations
   per charge, and holds the bags open longer. After you fire the airbag,
   the blower motor keeps filling the bag for 3 minutes, which can
   continue to protect you in the event of further slides. Then it
   reverses the motor, deflating the balloon. The reason: If you've been
   buried, this creates a void in the snow, increasing the potential
   you'll be dug out alive.

   Black Diamond Ion Headlamp
   Price: $25
   Small headlamps aren't uncommon, but they tend to be relatively
   expensive and don't have a full feature set. This affordable set has an
   output of 80 lumens and uses easy-to-find AAA batteries. It has
   touch-sensitive controls for dimming, flashing, and brightness
   functions, and there's a red LED mode to prevent damage to night
   vision. It also has a ratcheting tilt function, often found in larger,
   heavier LED headlamps.

   FootBalance Race Heat Footbed
   Price: $79
   Custom-molded footbeds are common in snow sports (not to mention in
   cycling and running), and the same goes for heated footbeds.
   FootBalance's new Race Heat system combines the two ideas so buyers get
   a customized orthotic insole threaded via a wiring harness to a battery
   pack made by Therm-ic (a common aftermarket heated-insole brand).
   Beyond skiing and snowboarding, FootBalance has seen interest among
   winter bike commuters and people who have to work outdoors in the cold
   and need additional support as well.

   Sony HDR-AS100V
   Price: $300
   Yes, this action camera debuted at CES last month. But trade shows like
   SIA are seeing more and more GoPro competitors because people are
   buying action cams not at electronics stores but at sporting goods
   stores, since the athletic community is the target market. Sony is
   seeking to carve out its place with features like the ability to
   capture super-slo-mo (240 frames per second) and a rugged, splash-proof
   body that doesn't require a case. And what Sony calls the "broadcast
   quality" XAVC S codec developed for HD has now migrated from the
   camcorder market to the tiny action-cam format. Maximum wide angle is
   170 degrees, and the sensor size is an impressive 18 megapixels.
   Available in March.

   Patagonia Nano Air Hoodie
   Price: $249
   If you've ever worn a typical fleece for athletic activities, then you
   know the drill: It can get very hot when you're working hard, but it
   lets in too much air when the wind is blowing. Wear a synthetic or down
   puffy instead and there isn't enough air permeability to prevent sweat
   buildup. The Nano Air was designed to have more air permeability, but
   not as much as a typical fleece. It's made with four-way-stretch for
   easier freedom of movement as well, and a DWR (durable water repellent)
   finish adds some wind and water resistance, and includes rip-stop to
   prevent tears.

   Salomon QBC Lab Ski
   Price: $799
   Ultralight skis are the new normal, with carbon fiber allowing for
   lightness as well as stiffness. The downside is that skis like this can
   be noisy, with a lot of vibration on rougher snow. Although there are a
   variety of approaches to quelling that noise, QBC Lab's design is one
   of the most novel. Flax linen is added to the construction, essentially
   putting a blanket atop the carbon. And while $799 isn't cheap, normal
   carbon skis tend to run north of $1000.

   Smith Optics Archive Collection
   Price: $80 and up
   If you're into retro looks, you'll dig Smith's revisiting of some of
   its iconic shapes from the brand's history. The retro-redux frames are
   made from cellulose, as they were back in the day, although for
   safety's sake the lens tech is updated to modern carbonic materials and
   protection grades (UVA-B shielding and the like). The multiple lines
   include revisits to 1988, 1991, and 1993 vintages, with multiple styles
   in each set.

   Dynafit RC1 Boot
   Price: $2100
   Randonnee is the sport of racing uphill and skiing back down. It's a
   huge deal in Europe, and it's also pushing the arms race of technology
   within standard downhill, where lighter weight is all the rage. We may
   not see anything this radical in alpine for a while yet, however—the
   RC1 is an insanely lightweight all-carbon-shell randonnee boot
   hand-constructed in Europe. There's minimal retention or frills, and it
   costs an eye-bleeding $2100. But if your aim is pushing new boundaries,
   there's no question this boot does that.
