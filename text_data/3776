Meet the Cutest Kitten in the World!

   bentorode00

   ◄ Back
   Next ►
   Picture 1 of 12
   [INS: :INS]

   When we first came across Daisy, we proudly declared her “The Cutest
   Little Kitten in the World.” There’s no denying her cuteness, the way
   she plays the piano, hides in bowls and sweetly gazes at bubbles make
   her undeniably adorable. Ben Torode, her proud owner, gave us a
   wonderful glimpse into her world telling us in this interview, “Daisy
   doesn’t like to be held or even petted that much, but she HATES to be
   alone. Her happiest time (apart from eating) is joining us on the bed.
   She just likes to be near us and that’s when she’ll purr like crazy.”

   You may not know it but Daisy has a partner in crime! Yes, Torode got
   Daisy in May 2012 and then Hannah just three months later. “Daisy was
   having trouble understanding how hard to bite or scratch us (way too
   hard) and we wanted to get her a sister so she could learn to play
   properly, because when they get bitten they learn how much is too
   much,” Torode tell us.

   When asked what he hopes everyone gets out of these photos, Torode told
   us this, “For the people who watch my Flickr andBlipfoto streams, it
   seems the most interesting thing has been seeing these two cats slowly
   become accustomed to one another despite their very different traits.
   I’m glad we got two very different cats and I’m just happy to share the
   joy of owning them in a visual way.”
