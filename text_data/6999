Emissions Sources For Deforestation-Related Carbon Dioxide Emissions (image)

Caption

   Emissions sources for deforestation-related carbon dioxide emissions
   are diverse and vary by region. Emissions embodied in production are
   shown for each commodity group within each region. A region's width on
   the x-axis corresponds to the embodied emissions produced in that
   region, while the y-axis shows the share of emission attributed to each
   commodity group within each region, implying that the rectangles within
   the plot are scaled according to the emissions embodied in each
   region-commodity combination. The percentages within the rectangles
   indicate the share of the total embodied emissions; 2.6?gigatonnes of
   carbon dioxide due to tropical deforestation during the period
   2010-2014.

   News Release 10-Jun-2019

2019 'dead zone' may be the second largest on record

   Louisiana State University
   Share
    Print  E-Mail

   A recent forecast of the size of the "Dead Zone" in the northern Gulf
   of Mexico for late July 2019 is that it will cover 8,717-square-miles
   of the bottom of the continental shelf off Louisiana and Texas. The
   unusually high Mississippi River discharge in May controls the size of
   this zone, which will likely be the second largest zone since
   systematic measurements began in 1985. The water mass with oxygen
   concentrations less than 2 parts per million forms in bottom waters
   each year primarily as a result of nitrogen and phosphorus loading from
   the Mississippi River watershed, which fertilizes the Gulf of Mexico's
   surface waters to create excessive amounts of algal biomass. The
   decomposition of this plant material in the bottom layer leads to
   oxygen loss.

   The low oxygen conditions in the gulf's most productive waters stresses
   organisms and may even cause their death, threatening living resources,
   including fish, shrimp and crabs caught there. Low oxygen conditions
   started to appear 50 years ago when agricultural practices intensified
   in the Midwest. No reductions in the nitrate loading from the
   Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico have occurred in the last few
   decades.

   The predicted hypoxic area is about the size of the land area of New
   Hampshire and about 4.5 times the size of the Hypoxia Action Plan goal.
   This estimate assumes that there are no significant tropical storms in
   the two weeks before the monitoring cruise or during the cruise. The
   estimate is made each year by LSU scientists Eugene Turner and Nancy
   Rabalais. The report is posted at https://gulfhypoxia.net/research/
   shelfwide-cruise/?y=2019&p=hypoxia_fc.

Emissions Sources For Deforestation-Related Carbon Dioxide Emissions (image)

Caption

   Emissions sources for deforestation-related carbon dioxide emissions
   are diverse and vary by region. Emissions embodied in production are
   shown for each commodity group within each region. A region's width on
   the x-axis corresponds to the embodied emissions produced in that
   region, while the y-axis shows the share of emission attributed to each
   commodity group within each region, implying that the rectangles within
   the plot are scaled according to the emissions embodied in each
   region-commodity combination. The percentages within the rectangles
   indicate the share of the total embodied emissions; 2.6?gigatonnes of
   carbon dioxide due to tropical deforestation during the period
   2010-2014.

   News Release 10-Jun-2019

2019 'dead zone' may be the second largest on record

   Louisiana State University
   Share
    Print  E-Mail

   A recent forecast of the size of the "Dead Zone" in the northern Gulf
   of Mexico for late July 2019 is that it will cover 8,717-square-miles
   of the bottom of the continental shelf off Louisiana and Texas. The
   unusually high Mississippi River discharge in May controls the size of
   this zone, which will likely be the second largest zone since
   systematic measurements began in 1985. The water mass with oxygen
   concentrations less than 2 parts per million forms in bottom waters
   each year primarily as a result of nitrogen and phosphorus loading from
   the Mississippi River watershed, which fertilizes the Gulf of Mexico's
   surface waters to create excessive amounts of algal biomass. The
   decomposition of this plant material in the bottom layer leads to
   oxygen loss.

   The low oxygen conditions in the gulf's most productive waters stresses
   organisms and may even cause their death, threatening living resources,
   including fish, shrimp and crabs caught there. Low oxygen conditions
   started to appear 50 years ago when agricultural practices intensified
   in the Midwest. No reductions in the nitrate loading from the
   Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico have occurred in the last few
   decades.

   The predicted hypoxic area is about the size of the land area of New
   Hampshire and about 4.5 times the size of the Hypoxia Action Plan goal.
   This estimate assumes that there are no significant tropical storms in
   the two weeks before the monitoring cruise or during the cruise. The
   estimate is made each year by LSU scientists Eugene Turner and Nancy
   Rabalais. The report is posted at https://gulfhypoxia.net/research/
   shelfwide-cruise/?y=2019&p=hypoxia_fc.
