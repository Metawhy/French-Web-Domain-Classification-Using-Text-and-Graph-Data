What class of languages is recognized by finite-state automata with $k$

   $\begingroup$

   A DFA or NFA reads through an input string with a single head, moving
   left-to-right. It seems natural to wonder about finite-state machines
   that have multiple heads, each of which moves through the input from
   left-to-right, but not necessarily at the same place in the input as
   the others.

   Let us define a finite state machine with $k$ heads as follows:

     A k-head NFA is a tuple $(Q, \Sigma, \Delta, q_0, F)$, where:
     * As usual, $Q$ is a finite set of states, $\Sigma$ is a finite
       alphabet, $q_0$ is an initial state, and $F$ is a set of accepting
       states. Let $\Sigma_\varepsilon := \Sigma \cup \{\varepsilon\}$
       denote the set of characters including the empty string.
     * $\Delta \subseteq Q \times (\Sigma_\varepsilon)^k \times Q$ is the
       transition relation: a transition $(p, (\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots,
       \sigma_k), q)$ means that, if the machine is in state $p$, it may
       read in $(\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_k)$ such that
       $\sigma_i$ is the next character for head $i$ (or $\varepsilon$ if
       that head does not move), and then move to state $q$.

     A run of this kind of machine (any path starting from the start
     state and ending in an accepting state) results in not one string,
     but $k$ different strings (formed by concatenating the characters
     along the run). Then we say that the run is valid if the $k$ strings
     are identical.

     The language of the machine is the set of strings $w$ such that
     there exists a valid run of the machine where the $k$ strings
     produced along that run are all equal to $w$.

   Question: What is the class of languages recognized by such machines?
   Has it been studied?
     __________________________________________________________________

   A first observation is that such machines produce a class larger than
   the regular languages. For example, the language $$ \{a^n b^n \mid n
   \in \mathbb{N}\} $$ is recognized by the following $2$-head NFA with
   $3$ states: 2-head NFA example

   (Here, an edge labeled with $\sigma_1 / \sigma_2$ denotes a transition
   of the form $(p, (\sigma_1, \sigma_2), q)$.)

   However, a second observation is that not all context-free languages
   are recognized; for example, it seems that the Dyck language cannot be
   recognized by these $k$-head machines.

       $\begingroup$ Looking a bit around I see multi-head automata being
       mentioned in arxiv.org/abs/0906.3051: their definition is about
       two-way automata, but they also define the one-way variant. Isn't
       there something helpful in that paper? or in its references, e.g.,

   This model is one of the standard models in automata theory and it has
   been examined by some researchers.

   The references given in the first comment are very good starting
   points.

   When the head is two-way, the classes of languages recognized by such
   models are identical to logarithmic-space classes. However, when the
   head is one-way, then, up to my knowledge, we do not have a similar
   exact characterization, but, we have certain incomparable results and
   some hierarchies based on the number of heads.

   If you are interested in, I recommend you to check alternating,
   probabilistic, and quantum versions of multi-head automata, as well.
   Such models can be quite interesting even when using a single head, as
   the computation is split in into different paths, and then, in each
   path, the head may access different part of the inputs.

Arithmetic circuits over $GF(p)$ for computing $x \bmod 2$ given input $x \in
GF(p)$

   $\begingroup$

   Let $p$ be a prime. Suppose we consider the function $f: GF\left(p
   \right) \rightarrow \left\{0, 1 \right\}$ where $f(x) = x \bmod 2$ for
   all.

   The question is the following: are there any known circuit bounds or
   results on computing $f$ using arithmetic circuits over $GF(p)$?

   In other words, we'd like to evaluate $f$ using only field additions
   and multiplications.

   It's simple to do this with arithmetic circuits of size $O \left(p
   \right)$ and also probably straightforward to show that it cannot be
   done with arithmetic circuits of size $o\left( \log p \right)$.
   However, it has been difficult for us to say anything concrete other
   than these simple bounds. Any literature or references on this problem
   (or similar types of problem) would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

     * $\begingroup$ What is your notion of $x\mod 2$ here? My
       understanding is it must depend on the underlying representative
       (for example, in $\mathbb{F}_5$, $0\mod 2\neq 5\mod 2$, even though
       $0,5\in\overline{0}$). $\endgroup$ – Mark 2 days ago

       $\begingroup$ Thanks for the response! Sorry I was not more precise
       in asking this question. If we continue the analogy of working over
       the integers $\mod p$, let's assume that $x \in \left[0, p - 1
       \right]$. This avoids the issue you mention above. $\endgroup$ – A

   It's not clear if this is directly useful, but lower bounds are known
   for depth-3 circuits computing an $n$-variate version of your function
   over $\mathrm{GF}(p)$ for $p \neq 2$. See Theorem 3.7 in the survey of
   Shpilka and Yehudayoff for details and references.

   I don't believe lower bounds of the form $\omega(\log d)$ are known for
   general circuits computing an explicit univariate polynomial of degree
   $d$, so proving an $\omega(\log p)$ lower bound for your problem will
   likely be difficult.

     * $\begingroup$ Thank you for the response. While it doesn't directly
       apply to the problem I mentioned here, there is a bounty of
       references in that survey that we will investigate. We looked at
       trying to tie the problem to evaluating polynomials of degree $d$,
       but this seemed difficult due to things like the possibility of
       repeated squaring. $\endgroup$ – A Lost Cryptographer 12 hours ago
     * $\begingroup$ I believe these are referenced in Shpilka-Yehudayoff,
       but Bürgisser-Clausen-Shokrollahi's Algebraic Complexity Theory and
       chapter 8 of Bürgisser's Completeness and Reduction in Algebraic
       Complexity touch more on the complexity of univariate polynomials.
       Unfortunately, I'm not familiar enough with BCS to point towards
       something concretely useful. Hopefully something in these turns out
       to be useful. $\endgroup$ – Robert Andrews 11 hours ago

What's the point of stack judgement in CBPV?

   Call-by-push-value (CBPV) introduces two main families of types, values
   and computations, and their corresponding judgements. However, in some
   extensions/variants/adaptation of CBPV, there is a third judgement:
   stacks. What is the purpose of this judgement? Why it was not present
   in the original CBPV? What do we gain when we introduce them?

   The kind of extensions I am talking about are for example Levy's CBPV
   with stacks, or Egger et al.'s Enriched Effect Calculus, or the
   calculus in Ahman et al.'s Dependent Types and Fibred Computational
   Effects.

       $\begingroup$ The stacks make it an abstract machine, like the
       Krivine abstract machine. When you define the term calculus, you
       have a top-level reduction but it's often not enough to define an
       operational semantics. For example in the lambda calculus, you need
       to use weak head reduction the goes under some contexts. You can
       think of abstract machines as the top-level reduction plus rules
       that explicitly "move" in the term: the left part of the
       configuration is the subterm you're looking at, and the stack
       represents the context you are under. $\endgroup$ – xavierm02

     * $\begingroup$ So it is some sort of trick to express intermediate
       states in operational semantics, but not needed, if for example, I
       was interested just in a denotational semantics? $\endgroup$

   The point of stacks is that they are in a sense the dual concept to
   computations.

   A computation does not run in a vacuum. It is always "surrounded" by
   some sort of an environment, or evaluation context, telling us what the
   current "state of progress" is, or is recording "where we are, and
   where we're going". Often this sort of information has stack-like
   behavior, so we can call it simply a stack.

   The duality between computations and stacks can be made quite precise
   and is useful in formalizing and discovering various mathematical
   aspects of computation. I am not sure where you're expecting a more
   technical answer, but that's the gist of it.

     * $\begingroup$ Interesting. But why it was not present in the
       original presentation of CBPV? It's because it's not needed if
       you're not interested in this more operational view of
       computations? $\endgroup$ – Qhead 21 hours ago
     * $\begingroup$ I suppose it was not there because (a) it was "just"
       Paul Levy's PhD thesis and there are only so many things one can
       squeeze out of a PhD student, and (b) it takes time for people to
       figure things out. $\endgroup$ – Andrej Bauer 1 hour ago
     * $\begingroup$ (c) The stacks are a very French thing, Paul is
       English. $\endgroup$ – Andrej Bauer 1 hour ago
