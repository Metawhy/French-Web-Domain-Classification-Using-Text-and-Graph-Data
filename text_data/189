   Based on the well-known original memtest86 written by Chris Brady,
   memtest86+ is a port by some members of the x86-secret team, now
   working at www.canardpc.com. Our goal is to provide an up-to-date and
   completly reliable version of this software tool aimed at memory
   failures detection. Memtest86+ was, is and will always be a free,
   open-source software. The original Memtest86 is now handled by

   -= History =-

   The first version of Memtest86+ was released on early 2004, based on
   memtest86 v3.0 that was not updated since mid-2002. Our main challenge
   was to provide an up-to-date version of this useful tool, as reliable
   than the original. Our work started when we got the first AMD64 system.
   Unfortunatly, the original memtest v3.0 didn't run at all. After
   looking at the source code, we fixed the bug.After some days, I saw lot
   of other things like chipsets or CPU that were not correctly detected
   or not detected at all. As I'm the chief-editor of a french hardware
   website (www.x86-secret.com now integrated into www.canardpc.com), I
   have access to lot of recent hardware and I can test and debug on quite
   all available motherboards on the market. After adding detection for
   all current CPUs, I've added detection for all current chipsets (SiS,
   VIA, nVidia, Intel) and ECC Polling for AMD64, i875P and E7205. Then, I
   decided to display some useful settings for the most popular chipsets.
   For exemple, on i865PE/i875P series, memtest86+ will now display FSB &
   Memory frequency, PAT status, memory timings, ECC status and the number
   of memory channels. Next version will perhaps contain several
   enhancements and bug-fixes.

   -= History =-

   The first version of Memtest86+ was released on early 2004, based on
   memtest86 v3.0 that was not updated since mid-2002. Our main challenge
   was to provide an up-to-date version of this useful tool, as reliable
   than the original. Our work started when we got the first AMD64 system.
   Unfortunatly, the original memtest v3.0 didn't run at all. After
   looking at the source code, we fixed the bug.After some days, I saw lot
   of other things like chipsets or CPU that were not correctly detected
   or not detected at all. As I'm the chief-editor of a french hardware
   website (www.x86-secret.com now integrated into www.canardpc.com), I
   have access to lot of recent hardware and I can test and debug on quite
   all available motherboards on the market. After adding detection for
   all current CPUs, I've added detection for all current chipsets (SiS,
   VIA, nVidia, Intel) and ECC Polling for AMD64, i875P and E7205. Then, I
   decided to display some useful settings for the most popular chipsets.
   For exemple, on i865PE/i875P series, memtest86+ will now display FSB &
   Memory frequency, PAT status, memory timings, ECC status and the number
   of memory channels. Next version will perhaps contain several
   enhancements and bug-fixes.

   -= History =-

   The first version of Memtest86+ was released on early 2004, based on
   memtest86 v3.0 that was not updated since mid-2002. Our main challenge
   was to provide an up-to-date version of this useful tool, as reliable
   than the original. Our work started when we got the first AMD64 system.
   Unfortunatly, the original memtest v3.0 didn't run at all. After
   looking at the source code, we fixed the bug.After some days, I saw lot
   of other things like chipsets or CPU that were not correctly detected
   or not detected at all. As I'm the chief-editor of a french hardware
   website (www.x86-secret.com now integrated into www.canardpc.com), I
   have access to lot of recent hardware and I can test and debug on quite
   all available motherboards on the market. After adding detection for
   all current CPUs, I've added detection for all current chipsets (SiS,
   VIA, nVidia, Intel) and ECC Polling for AMD64, i875P and E7205. Then, I
   decided to display some useful settings for the most popular chipsets.
   For exemple, on i865PE/i875P series, memtest86+ will now display FSB &
   Memory frequency, PAT status, memory timings, ECC status and the number
   of memory channels. Next version will perhaps contain several
   enhancements and bug-fixes.

   -= History =-

   The first version of Memtest86+ was released on early 2004, based on
   memtest86 v3.0 that was not updated since mid-2002. Our main challenge
   was to provide an up-to-date version of this useful tool, as reliable
   than the original. Our work started when we got the first AMD64 system.
   Unfortunatly, the original memtest v3.0 didn't run at all. After
   looking at the source code, we fixed the bug.After some days, I saw lot
   of other things like chipsets or CPU that were not correctly detected
   or not detected at all. As I'm the chief-editor of a french hardware
   website (www.x86-secret.com now integrated into www.canardpc.com), I
   have access to lot of recent hardware and I can test and debug on quite
   all available motherboards on the market. After adding detection for
   all current CPUs, I've added detection for all current chipsets (SiS,
   VIA, nVidia, Intel) and ECC Polling for AMD64, i875P and E7205. Then, I
   decided to display some useful settings for the most popular chipsets.
   For exemple, on i865PE/i875P series, memtest86+ will now display FSB &
   Memory frequency, PAT status, memory timings, ECC status and the number
   of memory channels. Next version will perhaps contain several
   enhancements and bug-fixes.

   -= History =-

   The first version of Memtest86+ was released on early 2004, based on
   memtest86 v3.0 that was not updated since mid-2002. Our main challenge
   was to provide an up-to-date version of this useful tool, as reliable
   than the original. Our work started when we got the first AMD64 system.
   Unfortunatly, the original memtest v3.0 didn't run at all. After
   looking at the source code, we fixed the bug.After some days, I saw lot
   of other things like chipsets or CPU that were not correctly detected
   or not detected at all. As I'm the chief-editor of a french hardware
   website (www.x86-secret.com now integrated into www.canardpc.com), I
   have access to lot of recent hardware and I can test and debug on quite
   all available motherboards on the market. After adding detection for
   all current CPUs, I've added detection for all current chipsets (SiS,
   VIA, nVidia, Intel) and ECC Polling for AMD64, i875P and E7205. Then, I
   decided to display some useful settings for the most popular chipsets.
   For exemple, on i865PE/i875P series, memtest86+ will now display FSB &
   Memory frequency, PAT status, memory timings, ECC status and the number
   of memory channels. Next version will perhaps contain several
   enhancements and bug-fixes.
