   Climate change is a complex and intimidating threat. You can't see it
   when you look out your bedroom window. Its impacts are often not
   immediately noticeable, nor are the benefits of acting against it.
   ﻿Luckily there are a large group of passionate individuals who have
   dedicated their lives to studying climate change. These people write
   complex research papers, unpacking every aspect of climate change,
   analysing it thoroughly and clinically.  They understand the numbers,
   the facts and the figures. They know what is causing it, what the
   impacts will be and how we can minimise these impacts.
   But they're not robots. These scientists are mothers, fathers,
   grandparents, daughters. They are real people. And they're concerned.

   How do I feel about climate change?
   I feel confident that we WILL reduce emissions to slow global warming
   to a pace to which we can (mostly) adapt.
   Why am I so confident?
   Firstly, because in 2015, more than 1.5% of all articles in the New
   York Times mentioned “climate change”. This compares with 2% of
   articles that mentioned “terrorism” and 1.4% that mentioned “refugees”.
   As in other countries, the media profile of “climate change” is now
   very strong – politicians and the public see reports about our changing
   climate almost daily.
   ​
   Secondly, in 2015 over 15,000 scholarly papers were published with the
   topic of “climate “change”, “greenhouse effect”, or “global warming” as
   the topic. In 1988, the year the IPCC was established, only 68
   scholarly articles published on these topics.
   With such strong and growing media and expert interest, how can we
   fail?

   Climate change presents us with a huge challenge: moving from a society
   built on fossil fuels to something cleaner and more sustainable. I
   don’t really have feelings on the science of climate change, but I do
   have feelings about the cacophony of opinions and misdirection around
   the question of “what do we do about climate change?” On this topic, I
   feel discouraged, frustrated, and powerless.
   I am discouraged that the message is not getting out that we cant wait
   for action – we needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions yesterday to
   avoid habitat loss, sea level rise which endanger the lives of many,
   and more drought.
   I feel frustrated that I cannot even convince those closest to me that
   we are, as a society, being irresponsible, and our children,
   grandchildren, and people around the world will pay the price. Don’t we
   feel compassion for these people and the life we are signing them up
   for?
   And sometimes I feel powerless in the face of powerful forces arguing
   against action.
   But I think there is reason for optimism! Climate change presents us
   with a huge opportunity to redefine how we live in the world. Humans
   are remarkably resilient, creative and intelligent. Over the past
   couple of centuries we’ve gone from a world of manual labor and
   subsistence agriculture to a world where we can buy iPads in vending
   machines before we fly across the planet. The inventions of the past
   150 years rocked the world – why should we expect people to stop
   inventing, creating, exploring, and pushing the boundaries of what we
   think is possible?
   This is why I am optimistic. We know what we need to do- reduce
   reliance on fossil fuels, reduce the land needed for intensive
   agriculture, find ways to use less energy and materials, or re-use
   materials we already have. In fact – there’s chances for people to make
   tons of money from these inventions and technologies!
   Now is the time to apply all of our creativity and innovation to the
   big problem… So I am hopeful, in the end.
   Yours,

   Sometimes I have this dream.
   I’m going for a hike and discover a remote farm house on fire.
   Children are calling for help from the upper windows. So I call the
   fire brigade. But they don’t come, because some mad person keeps
   telling them that it is a false alarm.
   The situation is getting more and more desperate, but I cant convince
   the firemen to get going.
   I cannot wake up from this nightmare.

   How I feel about climate change:
   ·      Dismayed
   ·      Depressed
   ·      Powerless
   ·      Sad
   ·      Overwhelmed
   -But also-
   ·      Hopeful
   ·      Unwilling to give up
   I am a scientist mostly focussed on studying precisely how human
   activities are destroying coral reefs. On coral reefs climate change
   effects are hugely obvious and very depressing. Huge swaths of coral
   have died due to heat stress and more will continue unless drastic
   changes occur.
   It is very hard not to feel totally overwhelmed buy the magnitude of
   the problem and depressed by the extreme apathy of most of the worlds
   population (it seems) towards doing anything about climate change.
   But then there are bright spots of hope:
   - Suggestions of political will to actually change emissions.
   - Amazing ingenuity from people designing new fuels and engineering
   clever solutions to counteract emissions.
   - Some bits of evidence that the natural world is more resilient than
   it may at first appear (sometimes).
   -  Grass roots movements to make lifestyle changes and create community
   momentum towards sustainable living.
   I’m not yet willing to give up on a future where humans live lightly
   upon the planet, and I hope that you are not, either.
   All together we can fix this mess. But we do need to try!

   I feel tired!
   This is how I feel about climate change. At times I think this is not
   right. There is so much noise around the issue that I often feel
   compelled to be outraged by our own inability as a species to response
   to the challenge climate change poses. But the truth is that more often
   than not I just feel tired.
   As a scientist I found consensus incredibly boring! What motivated me
   to become a scientist in the first place was my desire to explain and
   model things we did not understand. It was never about preaching others
   about an existing scientific consensus. I feel uncomfortable in this
   strange role nearly as much as I am in discussing about believing or
   not in climate change. I am also tired of a debate that often becomes
   confrontational, dogmatic and sterile.
   But I am an optimist by nature and I like to think there is a lot we
   can do as scientists to reframe the dialogue between providers and
   users of climate information and present our collective knowledge in a
   way that is both more relevant and usable by us as a species. This is
   what I am working on at the moment.

   I feel overwhelmed by the debate surrounding Climate Change.  The
   science behind climate change itself is intriguing.  The debate is too,
   getting fiercer by the day, but also getting quite tiresome, because
   the motivation behind it is not purely science driven. Climate change
   is a multi-dimensional issue.
   Dealing with a large population, things need to be regulated, and so
   this has become a political issue.  As this has intruded into one’s
   belief on what is right or wrong, it has also become a sensitive issue.
   Good thing that there are now lots of places online where one can find
   solace, share common ground?

   I am unsure if every one of us is aware of the concept ‘Anthropocene’,
   a period of rapid population increase, technology and science, with all
   the problems and the good things that come as a package, that we are in
   it, that our action as an aggregate puts significant impact on the
   biosphere.
   The good things and comfort, we are addicted to and are deeply
   ingrained in our habitual patterns.  The problems are too complex to
   solve.  With that, it is hard to act, especially when it is a global
   problem, when it is easy to just point finger at someone else.  It is
   easier not to act, to find the reasons not to act.  But inaction is not
   a long-term solution for this.  The science implies that we should
   somehow get our act together, the sooner the better, for the prosperity
   of future generations.

   My name is Don Wuebbles. I am an atmospheric scientist and a professor
   at the University of Illinois. I am an expert in the physics and
   chemistry affecting the Earths climate system. I am also the son of a
   farmer and both of my grandfathers were farmers and my wife’s farther
   was a farmer – we grew up with the concept of being stewards of the
   land and we care about the future abilities of farmers to be able to
   feed the world. I am also a father, with 3 sons and currently 3
   grandsons. I am greatly concerned about the legacy we are leaving them
   and their peers because of the effects human activities are having on
   the Earth’s Climate. This is already affecting us and the potential
   impacts on humanity and the world around us are too great to ignore.
   We need to take climate change seriously and resolve it to cause the
   least harm.
   The science is clear, the Earth’s climate is changing, it is changing
   rapidly (much more rapid than occurs naturally), and the evidence
   clearly indicates it is human activities driving this change,
   especially from the burning of fossil fuels and from land use change.
   While climate has changed in the past, it has not changed this rapidly.
   The change in temperature, severe weather, and sea levels are also not
   due to the sun – if anything, solar output has decreased slightly in
   the last 4 decades. The observations clearly point to human activities
   as the reason for the changes we are seeing.
   In The United States, we have already seen a huge increase in the
   costs, both economically and in lives, as a result of increasing trends
   in severe weather events.
   Similar trends are occurring worldwide, these trends for more severe
   weather, more intense heat waves, more droughts in some regions, more
   flooding in others, and more severe precipitation, are all likely to
   continue. Sea levels could increase by 1-4 feet this century. The
   potential impacts of climate change on human health, on water
   resources, on agriculture, on energy and transportation, and on
   ecosystems are huge. We should all be concerned.
   But I also have a sense of hope. Humanity has shown throughout history
   that we can solve our problems. We now need to turn our attention to
   climate change. We don’t want to leave the warming conditions late this
   century to our children and grandchildren to sort out.

   What do I feel?
   I feel the twenty first century is the ‘human century’ because of the
   huge global challenges we face.  Of these I believe global poverty,
   global security, global inequality, environmental degradation and
   climate change are the most pressing. Of these climate change is the
   most insidious as it make all the other worse.  So our challenge this
   century is to build win-win solutions that tackle these multiple
   challenges.
   These are easy to conceptualise and design but of course much harder to
   implement given all the vested interests created by our warped global
   economy. However I see this century through the eyes of an optimist –
   as things are getting better for the majority of humanity though not
   nearly fast enough.  I feel deep down that politicians and the public
   know our rules currently governing society are outdated and not fit for
   purpose and new governance systems will be required to deal with these
   immense challenges.
   I know where there is humanity there is always hope.

   Dear Joe,
   You have asked me how I feel about climate change. It’s probably the
   first time I have ever been asked to say what I feel, rather than what
   I think and it’s a hard question to answer.
    In my day to day job I run simulations with a regional climate model
   of Greenland and the Arctic to see how glaciers, ice sheets and sea ice
   respond to greenhouse gas forcings. The processes and connections I am
   modelling and following are so familiar it is actually rather easy to
   bear witness to melting glaciers, rising sea level and vanishing sea
   ice with near complete detachment. Sometimes however, I am caught by
   surprise by a new result that at first appears counter-intuitive. Then
   I feel  that beautiful complex mix of elation, surprise, bewilderment
   and satisfaction as another piece falls into place, that characterizes
   scientific understanding.  It is endlessly fascinating watching how the
   planet reacts to a changing climate and we are learning so much about
   the earth system.
   Then I go home and what seem like very arcane models and far-off
   projections start to seem much more real. 2050 (the year Denmark aims
   to become carbon neutral) is no longer impossibly distant to imagine
   but my children will be only a little older than I am now. I have a
   glimpse of the possible environment they will likely experience and it
   is sobering. I feel a profound sadness that they will be dealing with a
   much degraded environment. They will be living with severe problems of
   our making, an acidifying ocean, reduced biodiversity, extreme weather
   events, rising sea levels and an Arctic environment that is very
   different from today. I have no idea how to start to talk to them about
   this.
   We live in a wealthy country that can (more or less) afford to adapt to
   climate change, but what of other nations?  How will the rest of the
   world deal with these challenges? These are scary questions that I
   can’t answer. In spite of all this I do not feel depressed about the
   future. Humans are an amazingly adaptable and versatile species. We are
   at our best when we work together on our grand challenges. Let us hope
   so at any rate.
   So, what do I feel about climate change? Interest, intellectual
   curiosity, satisfaction, excitement, extreme worry, sadness, fear and
   perhaps a glimmer of hope...
   Yours sincerely

   I feel exasperated that it is taking so many decades before society
   gets serious about the challenge posed by climate change – speeches and
   declarations, yes, but nothing has been done that measures up to the
   challenge. In 1972 I ran into a little book, “Inadvertent Climate
   Modification”, that outlined the problem we face today. I was convinced
   right then that this would very likely grow into a serious problem.
   Today we know much more about past climates and the massive impact we
   have on the atmosphere, oceans, and ecosystems. Every year there are
   more warning lights that start blinking red.
   What we do or not do trying to avoid catastrophic outcomes is a moral
   choice. What world are we leaving to our children and grand children?
   When emissions are limited, how do we allocate emissions rights between
   poor and rich nations? Our current economic system requires perpetual
   growth to function well.  How can we redesign our economy to function
   in the zero growth environment that the Earth will force upon us? Our
   observations suggest that may occur sooner rather than later. It is
   easy to see why progress has been so inadequate.
   In the mean time, my wife and I consider it our moral duty to minimize
   our footprint on the environment in any way we can. I also consider it
   my duty as a scientist and as a citizen to try to inform the public and
   policy makers clearly about the predicament we are in and the choices
   we cannot avoid.

   Dear Joe,
   How do I feel about climate change?
   Like many others I feel frustrated with the current state of public
   discourse and I’m dismayed by those who, seemingly motivated by their
   own short-term self interest, have chosen to hijack that discussion.
   The climate is changing and WE are the primary cause. The implications
   for the future can be troubling. It is arguably the challenge of our
   generation.
   But I also continue to be optimistic and feel that as climate change
   unfolds, the necessity of dealing with it is likely to spur
   improvements, not only in energy policy but also in the ways that we
   communicate and cooperate on local, national, and international levels.
   In a strange way, it could be an opportunity, a chance past the
   controversial “crossfire” debates that are a staple of the current
   public discourse and a chance for governments to overcome the tribal
   and national divisions that contribute to the current paralysis in
   dealing with the issue.
   Our changing climate might provide just the impetus we need to rework
   our public institutions for the better, in search of a global solution.
   Why now? Why this issue? Because our success in dealing with it lies
   beyond ourselves and our world is at stake.
   I’m optimistic we won’t waste this opportunity.
   John Fasullo.

   How I feel about climate change.
   Like all of us climate scientists, I have several different feelings
   about climate change, but the strongest is that I feel resolved to act.
   The area where I am now focused is on communicating climate science to
   the broad public. I am absolutely resolved to do whatever I can to
   inform and alert people about the many facets of climate change. I
   realize that helping to provide a better understanding of what
   scientists have discovered is not a silver bullet that will magically
   solve the problem, but I think it is part of the silver buckshot, the
   large number of worthwhile efforts that all need to take place.
   I have studied social science research on science communication. I am
   working with a partner, Susan Joy Hassol, an expert on communicating
   climate science. Much of what she and I do is described on the website
   climatecommunication.org. We understand that people want to hear
   messages of hope. They want to learn about solutions to the threat and
   challenge of climate change. They are not interested in seeing this
   issue framed as only gloom and doom. I too want to be positive and
   hopeful, and it is cathartic for me to convey information not only
   about climate science, but also about the actions needed to limit
   global warming to tolerable levels.
   I think that older climate scientists like myself are often well-suited
   to be public voices, speaking out about the accomplishments and
   findings of the science of climate change. We are experienced teachers,
   writers and speakers. We are not facing a career ladder asking us to
   concentrate on research and publications. Some of us are retired, or
   partly retired, and we may simply have more time now to devote to
   activities such as speaking to journalists, informing politicians, and
   writing for non-technical audiences. Helping to communicate what is
   known and what can be done about climate change is very often rewarding
   and fulfilling. It is indeed better to light a candle than to curse the
   darkness.

   Dear Reader,
   I’d like to start with an analogy that best explains how I feel.
   Imagine how a medical doctor feels having to inform their patient, an
   old, life-long friend, of a dire but treatable diagnosis. The friend
   angrily disregards what you have to say, for a variety of very human
   reasons, and you watch helplessly as the pain and illness unfold over
   the rest of their shortened life.
   There is a similar closeness between climate scientists and the planet.
   There’s a sense of wonder and respect. Nations and economies don’t like
   uncertainty. Climate change destabilizes the institutions we’ve built
   over centuries of stable climate and sea level.
   Returning to our patient, I feel frustrated that my friend won’t
   listen. But I hope they will listen to other doctors and come accept
   the diagnosis. I hope that, for very human reasons, the patient will
   see this as a positive, life-affirming choice.
   I hope that we see ourselves as the patient.
   Sincerely,
   Peter B. deMenocal

   Dear Joe,
   I became a professional climate scientist in 1976 and was passionate
   about observing climate, and tracking New Zealand climate from earliest
   observations.
   Along with other climate cohorts, I established my own climate station.
   Then I joined ‘Uncle Tom Cobbly and all’ (Tom Wigley, Phil Jones, Jean
   Palutikof, Mick Kelly, etc.) at CRU in 1980 and we were convinced
   global warming was real and would be attributable around 2000.
   Having been on this journey now into my fifth decade it has been
   fascinating to see it develop from an academic study to be highly
   politicised. Leaders and politicians of countries ‘don’t get it’. It is
   now time for all of those who care to speak up and out to make a
   difference so that we change our ways for the future abd those that can
   not yet speak.
   It is up to us now.
   If we will it, it will be no dream…
   So whilst there is enough good and committed people we can change our
   path of warming. I am always hopeful – but 4 to 5 degrees Celsius of
   change will be a challenge to survive.

   I feel like nodbody’s listening. Ok Sure, some people are listening but
   not enough of our leaders are listening – those that make decisions
   that influence all our lives. And climate change is affecting and will
   continue to affect all our lives.
   I feel like I will be the worst old person - “I told you so” will be my
   clichéd catch cry. But when I think that through and think about what
   that means ‘on the ground’ so to speak, for humanity, then I really
   don’t want to be that grumpy old person. Because that would mean that
   global temperatures and sea levels have risen. That we experience more
   extreme extremes in weather, and more often. That people are suffering
   through drought, bushfires, floods and inundation more often – who
   wants that for the world’s future?
   I feel perplexed at why many of our politicians, business leaders , and
   members of the public don’t get that increased CO2 in the Earths
   atmosphere is a problem. The very premise that CO2 traps heat is based
   on fundamental physics – the very same physics that underpins so much
   of modern society. The very same physics that has seen higher C02
   linked with warmer periods in the geological past. And sure, there have
   been warm periods in the past and the Earth weathered the storm (excuse
   the pun) but back then there weren’t millions of people, immovable
   infrastructure, or entire communities in harms way.
   I feel astonished that some would accuse me of being part of some
   global conspiracy to get more money – if I was in it for the money I
   would have stayed working as a geologist in the mining industry. No, I
   do climate research because I find climate so very interesting, global
   warming or not.
   I feel both exasperation and despair in equal measure, that perhaps
   there really is nothing I can do. I feel vulnerable, that perhaps by
   writing this letter I expose myself to trolling and vitriol – perhaps
   I’m better off just keeping quiet.
   But as a scientist I am trained to check and re-check data, to question
   the data and test the embedded assumptions. The data is solid, and
   there is time, just, to get CO2 levels under control.
   So I feel the need to continue to speak up as best I can.

   I have mixed feelings about climate change.
   As a climate scientist I feel privileged to be alive when things are
   changing so fast. Humanity is currently carrying out an unintended
   experiment on the climate system, which means that new questions are
   being thrown-up continuously and our knowledge is advancing fast. As a
   research scientist that is exciting!
   As a human-being, and especially as a parent, I feel concerned that we
   are doing damage to the planet. I don’t want to leave a mess for my
   children, or anyone else’s children, to clear-up. We are currently
   creating a problem for them at an alarming rate – that is worrying.
   As an optimist, I am hopeful that we can solve the climate problem. It
   is a huge challenge because it requires international collaboration,
   and for people to act on behalf of others. But that also means that
   tacking climate change could be a catalyst to develop a much better
   relationship between humans and the environment, and a more just and
   connected global humanity.
   Cue heavenly choir...:-)

   How do I feel about climate change?
   Afraid: for my grand children, for my family, for people. That keeps me
   awake at night.
   Angry: fossil fuels cause terrible pollution and climate warming that
   lead to millions of deaths every year, and many millions sickened. We
   have better options.
   Frustrated: with complacency. Parents who would leap between a bear or
   lion and a child – live in ignorance, confusion, or at best, fear. Leap
   into the climate debate, mom and dad.
   Sadness: many have been hurt, many more will be. Rapid action on
   climate change will save many lives and prevent enormous property
   losses globally, and in your town.
   Bewildered: almost all the weather extremes are becoming more extreme
   due to a warmer atmosphere. Why is that hard to understand?
   Nervous anticipation: listen to the science, or to nature. The latter
   will speak louder, with random and terrible viciousness - storms, heat
   waves, drought, floods, pollution – all causing pain and suffering.
   Excitement: we can fix this!! We have the plans, policies and
   technology to fix this. We can have great lives with clean, safe
   renewable energy. Please help! Get involved.  Demand action on climate
   at all political levels.
   Gratitude: thanks for listening – and for acting. Ask how if you need.

   I was unable to receive a hand written letter from Professor Trenberth,
   but he kindly contributed the typed copy above.

   Human-induced climate change is happening, of that there is no doubt.
   Yet there is a glimmer of hope that we might address it substantively
   every now and again.  I think that a principle of “user pays” should
   apply to burning fossil fuels so that all the downstream costs of air
   pollution and climate change are built into the price via a carbon fee
   or tax, or some related mechanism.  Changing the economics of energy
   and even subsidizing renewables while appropriately taxing
   non-renewable fuels could bring about a major revolution led by the
   private sector.  It won’t stop climate change, but then we don’t have
   to stop it entirely, but we do have slow it down a lot to enable
   adaptation to occur in a reasonable fashion.  There is hope.
   The burgeoning population and its demands on resources is a bigger
   problem. We humans are fowling our own nest, so to speak, in part by
   changing atmospheric composition.  It was not so much an issue when
   there were just a few billion of us – not that long ago - but now there
   are over 7 billion living unsustainably.  In general I feel quite
   pessimistic about the future and the kind of planet we will leave the
   future generations.   It seems likely that we will continue to boom and
   then bust in one-way or another.    The main way we “deal” with it is
   to have lots of regional wars and conflicts.  What happens when
   regional becomes intercontinental? Step back from our planet and
   observe our species and its (lack of) governance.  Now that is scary.

   Dear Joe
   How do I feel about climate change?
   Well that’s tough. You see, I feel several conflicting emotions. I feel
   concern, bemusement, frustration, disgust, anger, and hope. Yes, most
   of all, I feel hope. I’ll come back to that later.
   Why do I feel concern? I feel concern that we will leave behind a
   fundamentally degraded planet for our children. I feel concern that my
   8 year old daughter, her children, and grandchildren may end up asking
   why it is that my generation failed to act in time to avert a
   catastrophe. The decisions we are making today will have profound
   consequences for what sort of planet we leave behind for future
   generations. If we continue to burn fossil fuels and elevate the
   concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, we risk soon
   locking in dangerous and potentially irreversible climate
   changes—changes that will cause much suffering for us and for future
   generations.
   Why do I feel bemusement? Because the scientific case is clear. The
   world’s scientists have reached a consensus that climate change is
   real, caused by us, and a threat if we if we fail to act. Yet in much
   of our public discourse, we’re still stuck in a substantially bad-faith
   debate about whether the problem even exists.
   I feel frustration that politicians, by-and-large, are failing to act
   on the problem, even as the scientific evidence and the case for action
   becomes ever clearer. I feel disgust because, while some of the
   ignorance of our elected representatives is real, much of it is
   willful. The most vociferous opposition to action comes from
   politicians in the pay of fossil fuel special interests. That special
   interests and those who shill for them would readily mortgage the
   health of our planet for future generations for the sake of short-term
   profit angers me.
   Finally, then, how is it that I still feel hope? We are at a critical
   juncture. Time is slipping away. Yet there is still time to make the
   changes in behavior and policy necessary to avert the most dangerous
   climate change impacts. There is a heightened level of awareness among
   the public of the challenge we face. The highly successful recent
   People’s Climate March in New York City are testament to that.
   Historically, when we have stood on the precipice—be it due to acid
   rain, ozone depletion, or other environmental threats, we have acted in
   time. I have faith that we will this time as well.
   So at the end of the day, it is actually hope, among all my conflicting
   emotions, that wins out for me.
   Sincerely,
   Michael E. Mann

   Dear Joe,
   India, my home country, is home to nearly 20 percent of the world’s
   population, including 40 percent of the world's poor.  A key reason for
   this widespread poverty is that most parts of the country are very
   prone to climatic extremes, which regularly impact agricultural
   production and farmers’ livelihood. It is painful to see such a large
   number of our people, especially children, going hungry to bed for
   several days.
   What is ironic that although these poor people are not contributing to
   climate change,  they are the ones most affected by it. The world needs
   to take action quickly to control greenhouse gas emissions and reduce
   the pace of climate change for our common environment and for the
   future. As researchers we are making sincere efforts to develop climate
   adapted technologies to ensure continued food supplies. Addressing
   simultaneously issues of poverty, human capital, institutions and
   governance are equally important to ensure that food security, and as a
   consequent happiness and quality of life, increases for all.

   Dear Joe,
   My Research is concerned with making projections of climate change
   using complex climate models.
   I used to think that this research was somewhat hypothetical. We are
   answering questions like ‘What will the climate of the Earth be like if
   we follow this scenario of greenhouse gas emissions?’ I used to joke
   with my colleagues that we could publish our results in the ‘Journal of
   Unverifyable Science’.
   It seems to me now that we are following these scenarios of
   ever-increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. Our projections of
   hypothetical scenarios might actually be tested.
   From a scientific point of view, it is always good to get more data to
   test your theories. But I worry that we still have much to learn about
   the details of climate change in the future.
    No doubt there will be surprises in the real world that are not in our
   models.
   Best Wishes,
   Mat Collins.

   My feelings about climate change are a mixture of awe, hope, despair,
   frustration and anger.
   Awe: Climate change is part of climate and climate is part of the
   natural world that sustains us. It is majestic and beautiful
   Hope: Humans are incredibly smart. We have the capabilities to repair
   climate and to lighten our footprints to what the planet can sustain.
   Despair: Humans are incredibly dumb. We find it very hard to think
   beyond me, here and now. Yet our task is to fix a generation of
   problems that are global and centennial – to learn to share a finite
   planet.
   Frustration: The situation has been clear for two decades, and we’re no
   further forward now than then.
   Anger: Climate change has become everybody’s lightening rod, a route
   for conducting vast charges. Contrarians want to use it to beat up the
   left; the left want to use it to beat up capitalism; despair junkies
   want to use it to beat up everybody.

   Dear Joe,
   My overwhelming emotion is anger; anger that is fuelled not so much by
   ignorance, but by greed and profiteering at the expense of future
   generations. I am not referring to some vague, existential bonding to
   the future human race; rather, I am speaking as a father of a seven
   year-old girl who loves animals and nature in general. As a biologist,
   I see irrefutable evidence every day that human-driven climate
   disruption will turn out to be one of the main drivers of the
   Anthropocene mass extinction event now well under way.
   Public indifference and individual short-sightedness aside, I am
   furious that politicians like Abbott and his anti-environment henchman
   are stealing the future from my daughter, and laughing about it while
   they line their pockets with the figurative gold proffered by the
   fossil-fuel industry. Whether it is sheer stupidity, greed, deliberate
   dishonesty or all three, the outcome is the same – destruction of the
   environmental life-support system that keeps us all alive and
   prosperous. Climates change, but the rapidity with which we are
   disrupting the current climate on top of the already heavily
   compromised environmental health of the planet makes the situation
   dire.
   My frustration with these greedy, lying bastards is personal.
   Human-caused climate disruption is not a belief – it is one of the
   best-studied phenomena on Earth. Even a half-wit can understand this.
   As any father would, anyone threatening my family will by on the
   receiving end of my ire and vengeance. This anger is the manifestation
   of my deep love for my daughter, and the sadness I feel in my core
   about how others are treating her future.
   Mark my words, you plutocrats, denialists, fossil-fuel hacks and
   science charlatans – your time will come when you will be backed
   against the wall by the full wrath of billions who have suffered from
   your greed and stupidity, and I’ll be first in line to put you there.

   Dear Joe,
   In the last year I’ve become a mum and I’ve found myself looking at my
   son and wondering how I will justify the loss of so much beauty and
   diversity to him. My generation has the power to stop and even reverse
   this environmental demise, yet it is the next generation, my sons
   generation, who will bear the brunt of our choices and face the
   environmental and social consequences.
   I’m lucky to have been a marine biologist for the last 20 years. I look
   at my underwater photos of amazing coral reefs, diverse fish and baby
   turtles hatching and I feel very sad that my son, his friends and their
   children may never see the amazing things I have seen. Yet when I look
   at photos from the generation before me, I also realise that things
   have been in decline for some time. Their photos show even more fish,
   massive healthy corals and crystal clear waters in locations where I
   now struggle to see my hand in front of my face because the water is so
   dirty.
   I am however an optimist, I believe people are capable of amazing
   things and I do believe that climate change can be halted and even
   reversed. I just hope it happens in my life-time. I don’t want to
   become the generation that future children talk of as having destroyed
   the planet. I’d like to be the generation that fought back (and won)
   against human induced climate change. The generation that worked out
   how to live in harmony with the planet – that generation!

   The main things I feel about this are deep disappointment and anger,
   though I should probably try not to.
   People have always faced challenges and adversity. When these are
   accepted and faced together, it can bring out our best – I believe this
   is what allows peoples of the world who endure great hardships to
   remain happy nonetheless.
   The opposite is happening with this issue. We face a problem that could
   be addressed with relatively minor shared sacrifices, but instead there
   is a mass effort to ignore, defer, deny, and lie. Knowing that it will
   fall mostly on our own children, and their kids. On the part of people
   – of a generation – who are farther from hardship than almost any in
   history.
   Global warming doesn’t bother me as much as what it is revealing about
   humans. Maybe I need to just grow up and get over it!
   But that won’t help my kids any.

   I have been studying climate variability and change for more than 20
   years. One point needs to be emphasized is that many of us are misled
   by a small headline global temperature rise of less than one degree
   Celsius so far. Impacts associated with a 2 degree Celsius rise can be
   huge on regional scales, yet the smaller number tends to create
   complacency. Impacts of climate change tend to be exerted though
   extreme events. Black Saturday Bushfire is an example of such extremes,
   when temperature in Melbourne rose to 46.4 degrees Celsius.
   Research has shown that if emission of greenhouse gasses continues at
   the present rate, extreme El Nino events, as occurred in 1982/83, which
   contributed to the severity of Ash Wednesday bushfire, will double in
   frequency of climate extremes induced by changes in the Indian Ocean
   will increase by a factor of three. Such extremes were responsible for
   the catastrophic 1997 floods in East African countries, killing many
   thousand and displacing several hundred thousands more.
   We owe our grandchildren concrete actions to reduce greenhouse emission
   so that their world is a safer place less impacted by climate extremes.

   From time to time I do think about the future. My dream is that the

   On a recent visit to Arnhem Land, I was struck by the beauty of the
   landscapes and seascapes, the rich variety of species, and the
   staggering amount of art, going back 60,000 years, that permeate the
   landscape. The first Australians clearly learned how to live in tune
   with the land, understanding and respecting the great cycles of planet
   Earth that provide the goods and services that support human life.
   We think we have come a long way from they but – in one very important
   respect – we have regressed significantly. The first Australians were
   intimately connected with the biosphere around them, and made sure that
   future generations had the same, stable life support system they had.
   Present day Australians, however, have increasingly cut themselves off
   from the biosphere, ignorant of its functioning and importance, and
   rapidly eroding it’s integrity.
   Climate change is one of many global changes that are destabilising our
   planetary life support system. It is ultimately a question of core
   values. Can we change our core values rapidly enough – and decisively
   enough – to halt our slide towards collapse? That is humanity’s most
   important question in the 21st century!

   We live in a noisy world. Anyone living in a developed nation is
   bombarded by information; 24 hour news reporting, the blogosphere, the
   twitterverse, facebook, all competing for a precious few seconds of our
   eyeballs. Only the most spectacular, outrageous or just plain salacious
   stories are able to gain traction amongst this noise.
   Climate change as an issue is inevitably being framed in the same way,
   an all-or-nothing problem competing for our attention. Climate change
   must be an absolutely catastrophic Doomsday phenomenon, or it is not
   important. As scientists, we must be absolutely, completely certain,
   and if we are not then we obviously have no idea; no room for nuance or
   judgement in a 30 second sound bite!
   The reality is that climate change is, almost certainly, not going to
   cause a Hollywood-style sudden apocalypse. It is best thought of as a
   ubiquitous, insidious process that will influence almost everything,
   sometimes in ways that are not at all obvious. Climate didn’t cause the
   political tensions that led to the ‘Arab Spring’, but drought and high
   food prices were definitely a factor; The Great Barrier Reef faces many
   environmental threats, rising sea levels being just one exacerbating
   factor; growing global wealth inequality is not due to climate change,
   but the fact that human emissions disproportionately affect nations
   with the least resources to deal with them does not help.
   We need to stop thinking about the Doomsday and think instead of the
   Everyday.

   Dear Joe,
   I feel nervous. I get worried and anxious, but also a little curious.
   The curiosity is a strange, paradoxical feeling that I sometimes feel
   guilty about. After all, this is the future of the people I love.
   I get frustrated a lot; by the knowns, the unknowns, and the lack of
   action. I get angry at the invalid opinions that are all-pervasive in
   this age of indiscriminant information, where evidence seems to play
   second fiddle to whomever can shout the loudest. I often feel like
   shouting…
   But would that really help? I feel like they don’t listen anyway. After
   all, we’ve been shouting for years.
   I hate feeling helpless. I’m ashamed to say that, sometimes, my
   frustration leads to apathy. I hate feeling apathetic.
   But sometimes I read things, or see things, from individuals, from
   communities like ‘1 million solar panels installed in Australian
   homes”, and optimism tickles.
   I will keep doing my work. I will keep shouting in my own little way. I
   will be optimistic that we will do something about this, collectively.
   I live in hope that the climate changes on the graphs that I stare into
   every day wont be as bad as my data tells me, because we worked
   together to find a solution. All I can hope is that people share my
   optimism and convert it into Action.

   Dear Jo,
   You ask me how climate change makes me feel.
   I do not have a single answer.
   In equal measure, climate change makes me feel frustrates that my
   community cannot overcome ignorance and apathy. I feel scared that I
   cannot trigger action. I feel scared about what the future brings. But
   most of all, to be honest, I feel challenged by the science, I feel
   invigorated by how bright my group is and I feel very lucky that each
   day brings new challenges to confront and sometimes to overcome.

   My Dear Friend,
   For sometime now I’ve been terribly worried. I wish I didn’t have to
   acknowledge it, but everything I have feared is happening. I used to
   think I was paranoid, but it’s true. She’s slipping away from us. She’s
   been showing signs of acute illness for quite a while, but no one has
   really done anything. Her increased erratic behaviour is something I’ve
   especially noticed. Certain behaviours that were only rare occurrences
   are starting to occur more often, and with heightened anger. I’ve tried
   to highlight these changes time and time again, as well as their speed
   of increase, but no one has paid attention.
   It almost seems everyone has been ignoring me completely, and I’m not
   sure why. Is it easier to pretend there’s no illness, hoping it will go
   away? Or because they’ve never had to live without her, so the thought
   of death is impossible? perhaps they cannot see they’ve done this to
   her. We all have.
   To me this is all false logic. How can you ignore the severe sickness
   of someone you are so intricately connected to and dependent upon. How
   can you let your selfishness and greed take control, and not protect
   and nurture those who need it most? How can anyone not feel an
   overwhelming sense of care and responsibility when those so dear to us
   are so desperately ill? How can you push all this to the back of your
   mind? This is something I will never understand. Perhaps I’m the odd
   one out, the anomaly of the human race. The one who cares enough, who
   has the compassion, to want to help make her better.
   The thing is we can make her better!! If we work together, we can cure
   this terrible illness and restore her to her old self before we
   exploited her. But we must act quickly, we must act together. Time is
   ticking, and we need to act now.
   Yours faithfully,
   Dr Sarah Perkins
   Climate Scientist, Extreme Events Specialist.
   The University of New South Wales.

   Dear Joe
   It’s hard to imagine that people are doing so much damage to the
   natural world. It’s sad when a society like ours can’t see further than
   its bank balance and stumbles blindly into a future when children won’t
   be able to enjoy the flowing rivers, mountain snow, coloured birds and
   bush animals. Don’t we have any responsibility for other creatures,
   forests and rivers? I’m rather ashamed of our behaviour.
   It seems so silly to go on behaving like this – though, from hearing
   our politicians speak, it seems that making and consuming more and more
   is the point of life. Surely the dreadful heat we have suffered from in
   recent heatwaves, and the awful bushfires that have terrified rural
   communities in the past couple of years are telling us that something
   is going very wrong.
   Scientist friends say it’s probably because we’re making the world
   hotter by adding ‘greenhouse gases’ into the air. So we are seriously
   harming the world around us and yet we understand how!
   It’s really sad that some of our local children seem quite puzzled and
   worried by what they see on TV bout this and hearing what adults say. I
   hope my family and our community can try and help solve these
   frightening problems.
   Sincerely,
   Tony McMichael
   Emeritus Professor, Australian National University

   Knowing how much is at stake, knowing that I am one of the few people
   who understand the magnitude of the consequences and then realizing
   that most of the people around me are oblivious. Some of the people are
   not only oblivious, they also do not want to understand. They have made
   up their mind, maybe based on the opinion of someone they trust,
   someone in their family, or a friend, maybe based on a political
   conviction, but certainly not based on facts.
   It makes me feel sick. Looking at my children and realizing that they
   won't have the same quality of life we had. Far from it. That they will
   live in a world facing severe water and food shortages, a world marked
   by wars caused by the consequences of climate change.
   It makes me feel sad. And it scares me. It scares me more than anything
   else. I see a group of people sitting in a boat, happily waving, taking
   pictures on the way, not knowing that this boat is floating right into
   a powerful and deadly waterfall. It is still time to pull out  of the
   stream. We might lose some boat equipment but we might be able to save
   the people in the boat. But no one acts.
   Time is running out.

   I became a professional biologist because I just loved animals -
   watching them, catching them, studying them. I was the kid whose
   bedroom was full of jars and boxes of things that crawled and slithered
   and hopped. The notion that I could actually be paid for doing this, as
   an adult, was truly wonderful.
   But where to for our species in the future? Our biodiversity is our
   life support system, each species a precious support system, each
   species a precious, irreplaceable heritage item. We have harvested and
   cleared and plundered and spoiled. Every year our natural capital
   declines a bit more as we squander our heritage and rob our
   descendants.
   And now we have this new threat, likely to be the biggest one of all.
   Climate change is likely to become the biggest species killer ever,
   impoverishing our planet and our race.
   We have so much to lose.

   How does it make me feel?
   I feel frustrated. The scientific evidence is overwhelming. We know
   what's going on, we know why it's happening, we know how serious things
   are going to get and still after so many years, we are still doing
   practically nothing to stop it.
   I feel betrayed by our leaders who show no leadership and who place
   ideology above evidence, willing to say anything to peddle their
   agendas - leaders who are at best negligent and at worst complicit in
   allowing this to happen with full knowledge of likely consequences. I
   feel bemused. That scientists who have spent years or decades dedicated
   to understanding how it all works are given the same credibility as
   poleticians, [sic] media commentators and industry spokes people with
   obvious vested interests and whose only credential is their ability to
   read discredited blogs.
   I feel concerned that unmitigated our inaction will cause terrible
   suffering to those least able to cope with change and that within my
   lifetime many of the places that make this planet so special - the
   snows on Kilimanjaro, the Great Barrier Reef, even the ice covered
   Arctic will be degraded beyond recognition - our legacy to the next
   generation.
   I also feel a glimmer of hope. China and the USA are starting to move
   in the right direction and beginning to show some global leadership on
   this issue, even if Australia is backtracking again to a position of
   laggard and obstructionist.

   I was unable to receive a hand written letter from Professor Mackey,
   but he kindly contributed the typed copy above.

   Dear Earth,
   Just a quick note to say thanks so much for the last 4 billion years or
   so. It's been great! The planetary life support systems worked really
   well, the whole biological evolution thing was a nice surprise and
   meant that humans got to come into being and I got to exist!
   I’m really sorry about the last couple of 100 years – we’ve really
   stuffed things up haven’t we! I though we climate scientist might be
   able to save the day but alas no one really took as seriously. Everyone
   wants to keep opening new coal mines and for some reason that escapes
   me are happy to ignore the fact that natural gas is a fossil fuel.
   Well, no one can say we didn’t try!
   You’re probably quietly happy that “peak human” time has come and gone
   and it’s kind of all downhill for us now, though I guess you’re more
   than a bit miffed at what we’ve done to your lovely ecosystem (the
   forests and corals were a really nice touch by the way) and sorry again
   for the tigers, sharks etc.
   In case you were wondering, our modeling suggests that your global
   biogeochemical cycles (especially the carbon one) should reach a new
   dynamic equilibrium in about 100,000 years or so. I guess it will be a
   bit of a rocky road until then but, oh well, no one said the universe
   was meant to be stable!
   All the best and do try and maintain that “can do” attitude we love so
   much.

   Australian Psychological Society Pop-up Exhibition:
   ​The Australian Psychological Society (APS) is the premier professional
   association for psychologists in Australia, representing more than
   22,000 members. Psychology is a discipline that systematically
   addresses the many facets of human experience and functioning at
   individual, family and societal levels. The APS has a Climate Change
   and Environmental Threats Reference Group (CCRG) comprised of
   psychological experts in environmental and social psychology.  Their
   members have expertise in resilience, the built environment,
   conservation of wilderness heritage areas, the influence of the
   environment on individual and community wellbeing, media
   representations of environmental threats, behaviour change, adaptation,
   preparedness, and risk perceptions, amongst other interests.
   A selection of ITHYF letters were shown during the APS annual
   conference at the Gold Coast in October 2015. A number of psychologists
   were invited to pen their own letters. Talking about how we feel about
   climate change is an important part of being able to properly accept
   the reality of the threat and then be able to do something about it.

Using ITHYF in the classroom

   Teachers from all over the globe have used Is This How You Feel? as a
   resource to engage everyone from primary and secondary students through
   to university students. They have addressed climate change across a
   broad range of subject areas and through a number of different teaching
   styles and techniques.

   Now the team at Is This How You Feel? want to ask another question:
   Teachers, how could you use this website in the classroom?

   Take whatever you want from the website, concepts, approaches, the
   letters themselves. Test it out in the classroom and let us know how it
   goes.
   We want to showcase how easily climate change can be addressed in the
   classroom, and encourage a broader discussion around the topic so as to
   inspire and empower the next generation to engage with the issue.

   ​Teacher: Lisa Ryan
   Country: Hong Kong
   Age group: 11-18 Years
   Learning Area: Science
   Lisa first found ITHYF when feeling despondent about climate change.
   She knew she wanted to involve her students but wasn't sure how. After
   much consideration she settled on a letter writing campaign. Students
   used the ITHYF letters as templates and inspiration for their own
   musings. To date, over 400 letters have been written by students, many
   have been shared online through the schools Facebook page and via
   Twitter.

     "It has been wonderful to read students' points of view on an issue
     which has been and will be such a large part of their life. We are
     currently reading through all the letters and working out how we are
     going to manage uploading such a large number...
     ..It is important to give the individuals that will be most affected
     a voice and to help them realise that it is within their power to
     act and make a different in the face of seemingly
     insurmountable odds and that by acting they will also
     positively contribute to their own well-being."
     Lisa Ryan

   ​Students cover climate change both directly and indirectly at various
   parts of the curriculum in Hong Kong, but the schools letter writing
   campaign was started and overseen by the extra-curricular Environmental
   Action Group which is active throughout the school and undertakes many
   different initiatives throughout the school year. Every form group has
   an environmental rep who then feeds info and content back to the main
   group.
   ​The students responded in a very positive manner and it is evident
   from their letters that they took time to research the topic and
   that they were able to present reasoned arguments in support of action.

   ​Teacher: Ms Keeling
   Country: UK
   Age group: 12 and 13 Years
   Learning Area: Climate change - Geography
   Ms Keelings students had been studying a unit on climate change, they
   had looked at the causes and consequences of climate change and were
   moving on to look at what would happen in the future. As the starter
   activity for a lesson the students were shown the web
   page http://www.isthishowyoufeel.com/this-is-how-scientists-feel.html.
   Picture
   This helped them to look at how people felt about climate change, they
   then looked at twitter and some recent letters that had been submitted
   to @ITHYF_letters. Higher ability students were also shown the
   following video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APVAAE3b_ws. They
   discussed how they felt about climate change and the idea of writing
   our own letters was introduced.
   The students used lined paper to write their letters but the teacher
   had a typed template for students who were less able  (see below). The
   students wrote about how they felt and why they felt that way. They
   were able to bring in knowledge they had gained in the previous
   lessons. Some of the students also decorated their letters and the
   teacher collected them in to read and judged the best ones to be posted
   on Twitter (@KeelingKD) and Instagram (@kingdowngeogrpahy).
   Picture
   Picture
   The students were enthusiastic and able to articulate their responses
   well, many of them were happy to read their letters to the rest of the
   class. The activity showed that students had understood the concept of
   climate change and really wanted to do something to reduce the future
   impacts.

   In the fall of 2015 they initiated an experimental incubator programme
   entitled Talking Truth: Finding Your Voice Around the Climate Crisis
   with the goal of supporting and building on the understanding of
   climate disruption. They explore options for taking action while
   connecting participants with this weighty global challenge we all
   face. ​
     __________________________________________________________________

   Their experiential workshops employ storytelling, discussions and
   mindfulness exercises. The reflective writing exercise has been offered
   many times

   Picture
   Picture

   Participants enter a dimly lit room with background tonal music or the
   sound of ocean waves. They watch a short video loop of CO2 levels
   rising from 800,000 years ago until the present. After a few minutes,
   the images change to shots of the natural environment. This
   juxtaposition highlights the vulnerability of our ecosystems and
   creates a sombre and thoughtful tone.
   Participants are then asked to write a response to the question, “How
   do you feel about climate change?”  At the top of the page participants
   write their name, age and university association (though anonymity is
   fine too). This approach to engaging with climate change has been
   picked up in other areas of the college too.  Some professors have
   asked students to write responses during class, and in spring 2017
   Madeleine and her team set up a table at the Amherst Sustainability
   Festival to collect responses from community members).
   Artifacts of the reflective writing exercise are housed in the
   University Archives as a "time capsule" documenting the campus
   community's personal responses to climate disruption.

   They have collected  about a thousand writing samples (and some
   drawings) with future plans for sorting, coding, audio- or
   video-recording, and performing live readings of the work on campus and
   in the community.

   Educator: ​Tim Allen
   Country: UK
   Age group: University students, largely 18-22, with smaller proportion
   of postgraduates (21-26) and mature students
   Learning Area: Emotional impact of climate change
   Tim is the Education Officer at The University of Sheffield, where
   he works on developing environmental behaviour change initiatives and
   communicating them within the University. His latest effort Voices of
   the Climate Crisis is a photo project putting a familiar face to the
   realities of climate change, where members of the University of
   Sheffield community share their stories of climate change, and offer
   their solutions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Picture

   The project was carried out by a permanent staff members and a student
   casual staff member. They asked for thoughts on climate change from a
   number of "familiar faces" of the University of Sheffield community.
   This included Student Officers (the student leaders of the
   organisation) and international students from communities being more
   directly affected.
   Quotes from each individual were exhibited alongside their photos.
   The exhibition was live in the Universities busy students union
   building during term. It was also actively promoted on Facebook and the
   Universities website:
   http://su.sheffield.ac.uk/get-involved/sustainability/voices-of-the-cli
   mate-crisis
   https://www.facebook.com/voicesofcc/
   ​According to their website Voices of the Climate Crisis "uses stories
   of people facing the realities of the climate crisis and offers their
   solutions. We explore the intersections of gender, race and climate,
   recognising that women and people of colour in the Global South
   will face the impacts of climate change disproportionately."
   The students involved in being interviewed responded very thoughtfully
   and passionately, and reported that they were glad to be given the
   chance to reflect on this issue, scary though it is. Seeing their faces
   and thoughts alongside many others from the organisation made them feel
   less alone. Those who attended the exhibition engaged very
   constructively and gave the organisers positive feedback.
