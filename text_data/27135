   Cold Wax …. travel to a new place

Cold Wax …. travel to a new place


Inspiration 1:  The Book

   travel, debiriley.com Cold Wax Painting  – The Book

   Anything with “Wabi Sabi” has my immediate attention, as many of you
   have guessed by now.  Wabi-wabi Painting with Cold Wax by Serena Barton
    is on my list of Great Art Books to read. Beautifully laid out,
   logically presented and is easy to follow along and ‘ad lib.



   cold wax oils Cold Wax, Oils on Wood

   Cold wax is a wax medium primarily used with oil paints to extend,
   increase thickness, to create added depth, transparency to the
   painting.  With hot wax, ie encaustics, you need to heat the wax. Which
   is sometimes a logistical issue.


   I have, used cold wax over both acrylics and watercolours.

   It worked fine for me.

   Cold wax is easier, than how wax encaustics.

   Its ready all the time. It doesn’t give precisely the same results as
   hot wax encaustics, it is different. In a good way.

   I have experimented with both, and love both.

   Wax, either cold wax or encaustic,  have a certain quality to them, an
   otherworldliness. This makes them perfect for paintings denoting depth,
   space, antiquity,  and distant lands.

   Its this unique quality the wax provides, that I love.

   The aspect of travel of Other Lands,  suits cold wax application
   beautifully.

   Art is a form of travel.


   Why do I say that?

   Art is able to transport you in time and place.

   I suppose, its almost like a magic carpet. In a way.

   Art is able to transcend the barriers of the present moment – to
   project us forward, backward, or perhaps into alternate and magical,
   realms.


   If, the art is convincing enough.

   If we are fortunate to have a Muse, to help us!



The Art Muse

   Art in all its forms,  needs some type of a muse.

   Something to breathe  the breath of life into the art.

   Something to spark the ember into a fire.

   We need a Muse, that  Adds To   the world of art we wish to create.

   The Muse shares with us, shows us:  different approaches, fresh ideas.
   With the help of our Muse,  we  use all our senses as we go about our
   everyday living.

   Daily life, has been enriched.

   That, is what the Muse does for the artist.



   Expressive Art Creations  can’t  flourish,  in  conditions of rigid
   conformity.

   The Muse,  works best in a free unbound environment.   In utter
   authenticity.

   The Muse relies upon individualist creativity. That which can not be
   replicated,  mass produced.

   The Muse is no Lemming.  What is being created are  things of unique
   and rare merit.

   Imagination comes without an On – Off switch.  Sometimes its ON.
   Sometimes, its Off.



Travel to new lands –  Breaking Out

   Creativity isn’t   free to express its  voice,  if its   shackled to
   the same four walls.

   Art needs to be let out of the room, to go explore.

   Some  Where.

   Once in awhile.


   These 3 Mountain paintings, are from 3 completely different
   geographical areas.

   The exploring, the wandering, the travel …. it continues to  Add To  my
   daily life.

   Color On The Mountain with cold wax added


   We travel to new places,  To See.

   Discovering different pathways.

   To hear the songs from all across the earth.
   Ultramarine Mountain landscape debiriley.com Ultramarine Mountain

   Travel allows us to discover.

   Whether we are  walking a new street, seeing a new country, a new city.

   Using a new color, a new medium, a different paper.  Or a different
   brush.

   Without a bit of travel,  we become insular.

   We become wrapped within our own habits, routines, becoming slaves to
   our own Selves.

   Not noticing the treasures surrounding us.


   So.  By the occasion foray to a new land, a new media,  a different
   place,   we become more aware of our local  daily environment as well.
   Interesting.


   I’d always longed to travel the entire globe.

   Spinning the school’s world globe, studying maps of other lands.

   Dreaming of being a pioneer, of discovering  unknown places.


   While there may not be, many of those wild places left to discover and
   my days of scaling the rugged mountain peaks may have  finished…..  I
   still can hike (stroll)  and explore and conquer new lands.

   I can still travel.

    In many different ways.


   So can you.

   We may not all be able to jet off to New York City, Seattle, London,
   Tokyo,  Madrid, Singapore.

   But we can use Art,  as our vehicle, to  transport us wherever we wish
   to go.

   Any new place we go, adds to us.  We become more, Inside.


   Cold Wax is another way to travel to new places –  in your art.

   It has an adventurous, unknown, feeling to it.    It feels wonderful
   buffed and polished when dry. The layerings will create a sense of
   smoothed-over scarring;  with a dimension and depth that is
   irresistible.

   Making Magic

Making Magic

We all, can make Magic.

   One way, or in another. In some measure. It doesn’t have to be “Art”
   nor music, nor even in the sciences.

   Maybe you are one of the generous ones, the kind and thoughtful ones.
   Sharing your enthusiasm and your knowledge freely.

   That. Is a special kind of magic. People don’t forget it. I certainly
   don’t.

   It really doesn’t matter what your job title is, your career, vocation,
   etc. A convenience store clerk, recently showed me…. how skilful he was
   at making magic. Just by being himself. Being generous. When he did not
   have to be.

Magic is Seeing, What You’ve Never Truly Seen Before

   On the Art side of things, there is a kind of magic I find easy when I
   teach or coach a group of new artists. The kind of magic, that
   illustrates for them a variety of pathways and perspectives on how to
   see what they’ve never truly seen before.

   “Is Graffiti, art?” was one question for the group. At first, many
   didn’t see the art in any graffiti. But, some graffiti is so
   breathtaking, it defies any to not call it Art.
   graffiti is art, cobalt teal blue design, new perspectives in art, debi
   Riley art Graffiti in Cobalt Teal Blue

   I also am inspired when finally, I have been able to get an individual
   to feel, the art. Wow. Yes. Magical indeed the sharing of methods,
   techniques, thoughts, of ways how they can Feel it, and become aware of
   things they’d never felt, before. I do find it easy. Fun. Inspiring.
   Challenging. Magical.

   Yes. I guess that is a type of magic that I do.

   Making Magic applies to the practical side of creativity, the nuts and
   bolts ie the tools and materials, as well as the philosophical side.

The Magical Palette Knife PK 1008

   There is a Magical tool I love.

   It is the PK 1008. A very sensitive, versatile palette knife that
   responds perfectly. Fluidly. There is no stiff rigidity of stroke
   inherent to this palette knife whatsoever. It is far too sensitive for
   that!
   Watercolour Landscape with Palette Knife, on Indian Village handmade
   paper 22x30" Mountain Landscape – Indian Village watercolour paper with
   Indigo and Indanthrone paints debiriley.com

   The Mountain Landscape is a Palette Knife painting, a bit wild and
   rebellious…. that I’ve mounted on my last sheet of handmade Indian
   Village paper.

   I pre painted this in Indanthrone with Indigo for a velvety blue black
   to contrast my image. It worked.

   With the PK 1008 the sharp angle and width allow for a myriad of very
   expressive movements and technical applications.

   Double or triple loading the knife with a few watercolors, then boldly
   …. sliding it across the predampened paper – oh, my. That absolutely
   creates Magic!

   Making Magic with the Palette Knife is most likely my top favourite
   technique in creating art. Nothing else quite works outs like it does.
   Full of unexpected delights and color melting together. Beautiful and
   strange pairings that should not work, but Do.

   And even when the image isn’t doing so well in ‘your’ intended
   direction; turn it around. Maybe that palette knife, does have some
   mysterious magic in it after all. Many times, not only my work, but
   students’ as well, when reassessed in the upside down mode – it is
   stunningly Perfect! Amazing.

Palette Knife Magic Tips:

   My Tips for those wanting to use a palette knife with Watercolors, ie
   not impasto style, are as follows:

   Be Bold! Decisive. No fiddling, nagging, etc. Speak UP. Say it like you
   mean it, then leave it be.

   Review your Art Basics quickly. Tonal Values, Edges, Aerial
   Perspective, Focal Point, Details/contrasts. Then try to stick to most,
   of those.

   Most Importantly, use your artistic drive to make the audience FEEL
   Something! Don’t be content with recording the facts, the details, the
   accuracies.

   Go MAKE MAGIC!

   Art – Acts of Creation

Art – Acts of Creation

To Create

   What is it ‘to create?’

   Why  might this interpretive definition be important to you?

   While I’m specifically  writing this article for the current
   participants of my courses in Perth, I feel it is  relevant for many
   others who’d like to be encouraged,  as they create.

   watercolor painting techniques Acts of Creation, palette knife &
   watercolor

People who create things – ‘Creators’

   We do not, need to be  painters,  to be considered creators of art.

   If you make things, build things, develop things – you are a creator.


   We have been led, to believe only a select rare few, are artists. Are
   deserving to be named art creators.  Not so. We are all, born to
   create. In some form.

   Art, takes an infinity of forms: Music, photography, dance, building &
   bridge design, digital apps., surgery,  interior design, fashion
   design, coding, cooking, sculpture, writing, martial arts….  We can
   make anything an ‘art form’  if that is our desire.

   To take something to an ‘art form,’  we must truly love the subject.

   Become partners with it. At ease and in tune with how it looks, moves,
   feels, sounds, responds.  The beginning of artistry is love, time,
   connectedness.

   Whether we’re painters, teachers, computer app designers,  composers,
   surgeons, city planners – we all can enhance our work when we “feel”
   the situation, the surroundings, immersing ourselves in the subject.
   Being connected.

   Its this way we can best share the excellence of creation we have
   envisioned with the world.


   palette knife in blue Knife’s Edge A Dance in Blue

Acts of Creation:  All In

   We use, channel, harness all of our senses in order to create the art.

   But, we must do so opened up.  All In.

   To be All In,  means you’ve put everything on the line.

   Wabi Sabi, tears and tears

   You are Vulnerable.

   Stripped down to your core. And must engage the process  with
   sensitivity, with feeling.  Being attuned to,  in time with our chosen
   partner,  i.e. subject.

   What is your subject – Is it the Mountain? The ocean? The forest?  The
   dancers at the ballet?   The little rose bush, that the frost of autumn
   has  aged overnight?


   Those cool professional walls, barriers, and that distance put into
   place to keep us “safe” and protected from feeling hurt, or
   embarrassed?

   They don’t help us.

   What they do is  negate the power of creation we  could have  infused
   our art with.


   Why do we copy?

   Replicate Joe Smith’s painting?  What ‘risk’ are we taking in doing
   that?  If it is mocked and we are embarrassed, we can always say, “Oh
   well, I only copied Joe. Its not mine. Not really.”  And, no. It’s not.

   When we open up, we then are so vulnerable. And this is the  scary
   thing.

   It is an uncertain thing.

   We do not like the fact that we don’t know for certain if  our
   creation,  will work or not.

   IF, it will be ok.  Be ‘good enough.’ Or not.

   To have family, a friend, a mentor … “approve.”

   Get “likes” or not.  Get followers or not.

   Life is way too short, for us to make those approvals of monumental
   significance.

   Your own opinion, that’s the one that is of monumental significance.


   And, yes. It is a struggle.

   Every time we pick up the pen, the brush, the mouse, the knife, we hear
   the voice in our head tell us to  do it better this time.

    (Silence that voice each time.  It knows nothing.  Nothing…. of
   relevance to the act of creation.)


   It is the Uncertainty,of not getting it right, that stops us.  It is
   what blocks us, chains us, ties our hands from trying.

   It is the Uncertainly that stops us from being  ‘ALL In.’   Prevents us
   from  giving it every thing we have to give.

   But if we never try, never summon the courage, (in some cases we must
   invent it if that is what is required)  then the world, misses out on
   what we alone have to give.


   monotype in blue Fallen upon my knees, failing

   Yes.  We will stumble.

   We will fall to our knees.

   We will fail.

   Its ok.  I repeat, it is ok that we make mistakes, stumble, fail.

     *side note,  if you are a bridge engineer, aircraft mechanic, heart
     surgeon, airport traffic controller…. its ok,  if you have a little
     higher standards than what I’ve just mentioned.  In fact, thanking
     you in advance for it.  cheers!


   For too long we have all been told, trained and conditioned, to believe
   in the god of perfection.

   “Get It Right.”

   No errors. No flaws.

   No scars.

   No visible signs of cracks, age, wear or tear.

   In other words, absolutely no signs that we are, after all,  Human.

   How sad.

   Because, being human is the greatest asset we have. Flaws and all.



Acrylic Creations

   I’m currently mentoring privately a beautiful person, with acrylics. We
   are working on a helpful approach to lessen the fear of mistakes,
   flaws.  We’re developing a program with Multiple creative  resolution
   methods, imaginative  solutions, thinking outside the box.

   Addressing –  Society’s obsession with imperfections.

   It is a challenge to go against our training.  But, we can do it.  We
   simply repeat, the acts of creation we desire. Over and over, and over.

   In the mentoring sessions,  we are repurposing used acrylic canvases.
   They already have  colors and textures on them,  in abundance.   But,
   they were not quite working.

   The next step is to brush over, in selected areas large swaths of
   contrasting paint.

   We used White. Brilliant!   This creates a lovely and lively sensation
   of vibration and contrast. The underlying base comes through in places
    with the white, skimming along the surface to create fascinating
   patterns suggesting of bark, trees, foliage shapes.

   This Technique clearly demonstrates that the underlying “Imperfect”
   canvas, with its scars, its hard edges, its yucky bits…. actually was
   the perfect substrata for the project.

   I like how this art creation process can also be interpreted through
   the lens of life as well.

   An Act of Creation, Victoria Jane 2019

This is one of the pieces, my friend created using the acrylic methods
described above.   A Wonderful, act of creation.

Art of Connection

   I am in fact, expressing in paint, my world. Not yours. Not Joe’s.
   Mine. This is a very important distinction artists, creators need to
   make.

   When I create a painting, or photographic art image,  I am primarily
   attempting to convey the dialogue.  In other words,  the  dialogue that
   is going on between the subject and myself.


   That simply can not occur if I refuse to spend alone time with it.

   If I treat it callously, abruptly,  with little regard, and simply want
   to “use it” to make a pretty little picture to boost my ego – then, no,
   I can’t expect its true beauty to shine through.

   Its more effective to become friends with the subject.

   To learn about it. To immerse oneself into its world.


   Then…. Maybe I can create art that has a beautiful life energy within
   it.

   What I hope to create, is to convey the essence of what  I myself
   connect to and  “feel.”

   To define this. I think of it in these terms:  of having the emotion of
   Love of life,  emanate from my creation.  Just as a warm fire in winter
   compels and draws people closer.

   I know.  That is,  a lofty goal. And one I often stumble, fall and
   abjectly fail at.  That’s ok.  I’m All In.   I’ll keep trying.  Some,
   do work quite well.  I’m happy with that.


     In whatever form,  the art chooses to take for each individual, we
     want to strive to impart a piece of our selves,  into our  “Acts of
     Creation.”

   I have discovered a new word, I thought I’d pass it along to you.

   Its filled.

   And rich, with layers of meanings.

    I love it!

   It fits perfectly in describing a few select pieces of my art.

   I thought you too, might like to know about this word I’ll share it
   with you.

    Along with a mini collection of my favourite art works I’ve created.

   This is a collection of my own paintings created either on location, an
   echo of a memory,    or from a compilation of my own photos that I have
   taken myself on site.

   Just to let you know, none of them are particularly recent.

   But older.

   For me, I feel they have,  by virtue of their age, stood the test of
   time.

   They still give me Joy.

   Each one, still resonates deep within.

   Reminding me of how I want to paint.

   How I wish to create.

   Reminding me that  if I did it once,   (that is if I created a painting
   I genuinely can  feel the magic  echo within me years later,)  then
   yes, I can repeat that again.

   And again. And again.

   Success can be echoed.

   Zen Brushstrokes I Zen Brushstrokes II Veiled

The Art of More with Less

   Three paintings, on the surface they appear simple. Easy.

   Maybe without the studied and contrived perfection we’re used to.

   They have a type of non conformity that is in direct opposition to what
   “art is supposed to” look like. Or so, what many of us may have been
   told.

   They are Abstracts.

   Blurred, veiled and vague.

   With many abstracts, we’re left uncertain as to the precise, exact
   subject. There is no definitive object… leaving some of us a little bit
   uncomfortable.

   It’s the guessing. The wondering. Being in the dark, that we’re really
   uncomfortable with.

   We like it all spelled out. Clear.

   We are perhaps uneasy with the thought of guessing incorrectly.

   Nor are we comfortable with the huge margin for error that these
   nonrepresentational paintings provide.

   We are forced to use our intuition. To ‘feel’ the emotions from the
   painting and from ourselves. Once again, things many aren’t completely
   at ease with.

   A little secret, a painting can be likened to a person. It should
   emote. You should, be able to sense what the prevailing mood is. It
   shouldn’t be as if it were a flat empty face/space.


Depth and Layers

   The first image.

   The brush was fully loaded with three colors and brazenly, swiftly,
   applied. The colors merge together and yet, we see each individual.

   Connected, yet their own, individual entity.

   I love that philosophy.

   The remembered scene, a waterfall on the edges of Mount Rainier
   National Parks in Washington. The emerald and pine greens with the with
   frosted froth of the falls…. left an indelible impression.

   So even though this painting is an abstract, it’s been distilled from
   my reality. My depth of experience.


Blue Lined Road

   This second was such fun! Another acrylic, it had a bright neon orange
   base. Quite vibrating.

   I’d decided to overpaint to neutralise the shocking orange to a low and
   subtle level. I used a four inch old house paint brush to apply the
   blue and buff in five brushstrokes.

   Ie less is MORE.

   I paused, considering colors, tones, and the placement of those five
   strokes. I wanted to convey depth, texture.

   But also the feeling, the sense of “going” somewhere. That there was a
   path, a direction in which we could follow in our travels in this
   painting.

   I think that was accomplished.


Inferred

   The third image.

   The subtle hints, the mystery of the layerings and veiled coloured
   edges – is beautiful.

   I want to paint More,like this.


   Looking at this last image Veiled, there really is a lot of movement
   and texture and topographic work going on.

   One might need to look, that is to search into the crevices filled with
   the gold leaf dust, before the image’s true self starts to reveal
   itself as : the landscape.

   The landscape, Australia.

   On the surface, it appears flat.

   Empty even. But when you dig deeper, and look closer, you discover it’s
   immense resources. And beauty.


   That too is part of the More….. that I’m referring to.

   Queen’s Gardens: Sculptural Surprise

Queen’s Gardens: Sculptural Surprise

The “Part II” of Saturday’s Work Excursions

   Education. When I present skills, concepts and new techniques, I also
   learn. I learned …. a LOT, from my venture To Queen’s Gardens in Perth.

   On the job, on going education. Perfect.

   Ok.

   Yes. There have been days, of ‘not so’ perfect. And I most definitely
   will not share those with the public. But overall, it is a great gig.

   Sculpture Close up…. Sir George Frampton’s “Peter Pan” @ Queen’s
   Gardens, Perth

Sculpture: Peter Pan

   I left the green shaded groves, of the UWA Sunken Gardens. Leaving the
   calm, zen there.

   I drove off, into the city. Clearly following my well researched and
   diagrammed directions. I had studied this. I knew the route.

   Detours.

   In the city. Gosh. Who, would have suspected?

   Where was my Plan B?

   Needless to say, the first attempt to arrive at Queen’s Garden was met
   with Strike One.

   I ended up, very close to my original starting point. Oops.

   Do I give up and go home? Do I allow the city, and detours, to be
   victorious? I sighed. It WAS HOT. 90+ degrees. How bad, did I really
   want to go?

   But, you know, I am Determined.

   Someone just recently, made that comment – that I was very determined.
   I’m not certain if it that was a polite way of just saying, ‘Stubborn.’
   I’m thinking it was though!

   My “Stubbornness” won out.

   I continued on my target goal to the Queen’s Gardens. Finally, 55
   minutes later – I arrived! It should have taken 20, tops.

   Victory. Ok I met some more road closures, detours. And had to walk
   from the river to the Gardens. (Bonus, more exercise for me!) The point
   is, I achieved my destination point.

   I had a nice pleasant stroll around.

   Relaxing. Taking photos of turtles, black swans, golden breasted
   waterfowl, massive ivory waterlilies on the deep blue ponds, wooden
   bridges, and the famous bench from the movie “Notting Hill.”

   Queens Garden Perth, Peter Pan statue by Sir George Frampton

   Towards the end of my stroll I came closer to the large statue that had
   caught my eye earlier. It had looked like a Pied Piper of sorts.

   I was so immersed in the faces and features, the transcendent
   expressions the artist brought to life, I didn’t look first at the
   title or description.

   Instead I engaged with the art. Section by section.

   I loved the ‘rabbit’ like ears upon some of the figures.

   Once I was finished with taking the photos, then I read.

   I discovered the statue was based on JM Barrie’s story of Peter Pan.

   The sculptor was Sir George Frampton. This was one of his 6 replicas he
   cast from his original mould. This sculpture was erected in Queens
   Garden in June 1929.

   The original is in London, the Kensington Gardens.

   Apparently with the original statue, Sir George…. acted without
   authorisation.

   Overnight, without prior permission, he erected his Peter Pan statue
   unbeknownst to anyone.

   He did get chastised…. however in his defense he stated that he’d
   simply wanted the children to be surprised. To awaken and see the
   ‘Peter Pan’ in the gardens ‘as if the fairies had done so overnight.’

   I can just imagine how this explanation went over!

   But, I think, he may have had a smidgen of ‘determination’ within
   himself. I don’t think he was going to allow anything to dissuade him
   from his goal. He knew what he wanted to accomplish.

   And he did so.

   Finally…

   Artists need to have this quality of Determination.

   This almost wilful, stubbornness.

   It is this, that enables them to overcome the 1001 odds that are
   stacked against them.

   The challenges of the city proved to be an excellent educational tool.
   We can choose to give up too soon, or choose to be Determined.
