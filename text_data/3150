SIF17 - Highlights

   [2017-highlights.png]
   WATCH VIDEO | VIEW AGENDA

     "We need to prove that protecting the environment is profitable and
     in everyone's best interests. We can do this by holding up
     successful examples."
     – Erik Solheim, Executive Director of UN Environment

   Climate Action, in partnership with UN Environment, would like to
   extend our deepest thanks to all sponsors, speakers, partners and
   attendees who joined us at SIF17. You can now access the official Forum
   photos here and the event coverage here

   Taking place alongside COP23, adjacent to the Bula zone, SIF17 brough
   together 800+ carefully hand picked delegates, including: Ministers of
   Energy and Climate Change, Blue Chip CEOs, Mayors, Responsible
   Investors, Development Banks, Green Entrepreneurs and media, for two
   packed days of capacity building, networking, collaboration and deal
   making that will galvanise and fast track the green economy.

   Governments, cities and regions from the 152 countries that have
   ratified the Paris Agreement, must now meet their national climate
   change commitments ( INDC’s ) so they are looking for the clean energy,
   low carbon transport and finance solutions to make this a reality.

   SIF17 provides a world class line up of keynotes, panel discussions,
   networking sessions, live interviews, innovation spotlights, CEO
   panels, Mayors breakfast briefings and much more.

The 8th Sustainable Innovation Forum takes place steps away from the COP23
‘Bula Zone’!

   The Sustainable Innovation Forum was hosted on DHL’s lawn, in the
   shadow of the 162.5 metre Post Tower - a building powered by 100%
   certified renewable energy. On the DHL lawn, SIF took place inside
   award-winning inflatable structures, the Climate Action Domes.

   Alongside SIF17, we were delighted to host a variety of side events in
   the Climate Action Domes, including:

   -The US Climate Action Centre by W​e Are Still In

   -The 'Data for climate’ event by UN Global Post and Western Digital

   as well as high level meetings organised by The Hydrogen Council, ICLEI
   & UN Environment, United for Efficiency and more.

     “The 2017 Sustainable Innovation Forum brought together an
     impressive group of leading leaders and thinkers on low-carbon
     investment and innovation. Energy transition is critical to meeting
     climate goals, and the IEA was pleased to engage with participants
     on important topics of energy transition in the transport sector.”
       Paul Simons, Deputy Executive Director, International Energy Agency
       Paul Simons Deputy Executive Director, International Energy Agency

     “The SIF at COP23 was a great opportunity to get into the detail of
     how different actors are implementing the Paris agreement. We had a
     great panel discussing how cities are developing climate action
     plans and disclosing their progress against those including an
     honest dialogue
     about the challenges and opportunities cities face.”

     "To get on the right path to a better, safer future, we need to work
     together on common and systemic solutions, and to address the
     drivers of environmental degradation. The Sustainable Innovation
     Forum provides a valuable opportunity to share ideas and learn what
     others are doing.”

     high-level ministers, mayors from cities all over the world and
     young professionals to discuss the obstacles and opportunities of a
     sustainable development. It’s all about cooperation when tackling
     climate change. We always pick up new ideas and expand our network
     with the SIF.”

SIF17 - Highlights

   WATCH VIDEO | VIEW AGENDA

     "We need to prove that protecting the environment is profitable and
     in everyone's best interests. We can do this by holding up
     successful examples."
     – Erik Solheim, Executive Director of UN Environment

   Climate Action, in partnership with UN Environment, would like to
   extend our deepest thanks to all sponsors, speakers, partners and
   attendees who joined us at SIF17. You can now access the official Forum
   photos here and the event coverage here

   Taking place alongside COP23, adjacent to the Bula zone, SIF17 brough
   together 800+ carefully hand picked delegates, including: Ministers of
   Energy and Climate Change, Blue Chip CEOs, Mayors, Responsible
   Investors, Development Banks, Green Entrepreneurs and media, for two
   packed days of capacity building, networking, collaboration and deal
   making that will galvanise and fast track the green economy.

   Governments, cities and regions from the 152 countries that have
   ratified the Paris Agreement, must now meet their national climate
   change commitments ( INDC’s ) so they are looking for the clean energy,
   low carbon transport and finance solutions to make this a reality.

   SIF17 provides a world class line up of keynotes, panel discussions,
   networking sessions, live interviews, innovation spotlights, CEO
   panels, Mayors breakfast briefings and much more.

The 8th Sustainable Innovation Forum takes place steps away from the COP23
‘Bula Zone’!

   The Sustainable Innovation Forum was hosted on DHL’s lawn, in the
   shadow of the 162.5 metre Post Tower - a building powered by 100%
   certified renewable energy. On the DHL lawn, SIF took place inside
   award-winning inflatable structures, the Climate Action Domes.

   Alongside SIF17, we were delighted to host a variety of side events in
   the Climate Action Domes, including:

   -The US Climate Action Centre by W​e Are Still In

   -The 'Data for climate’ event by UN Global Post and Western Digital

   as well as high level meetings organised by The Hydrogen Council, ICLEI
   & UN Environment, United for Efficiency and more.

     “The 2017 Sustainable Innovation Forum brought together an
     impressive group of leading leaders and thinkers on low-carbon
     investment and innovation. Energy transition is critical to meeting
     climate goals, and the IEA was pleased to engage with participants
     on important topics of energy transition in the transport sector.”

     “The SIF at COP23 was a great opportunity to get into the detail of
     how different actors are implementing the Paris agreement. We had a
     great panel discussing how cities are developing climate action
     plans and disclosing their progress against those including an
     honest dialogue
     about the challenges and opportunities cities face.”

     "To get on the right path to a better, safer future, we need to work
     together on common and systemic solutions, and to address the
     drivers of environmental degradation. The Sustainable Innovation
     Forum provides a valuable opportunity to share ideas and learn what
     others are doing.”

     "The Sustainable Innovation Forum brings together leading companies,
     high-level ministers, mayors from cities all over the world and
     young professionals to discuss the obstacles and opportunities of a
     sustainable development. It’s all about cooperation when tackling
     climate change. We always pick up new ideas and expand our network
     with the SIF.”
