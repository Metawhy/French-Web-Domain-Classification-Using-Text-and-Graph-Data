Nara

Kawaii deer and superb temples

   Don’t be fooled by its size (with only 365,000 inhabitants) - when it
   comes to tourism Nara plays in the big league.

   Large numbers of tourists come every year to enjoy the charms of its
   large park which is home to deers that are classified as national
   treasures in Japan.

   One of its main advantages is that it is possible to visit all the main
   points of interest in the park on foot from the station in one day.
   Only the Horyu-ji Temple is a little further away, a 12-minute train
   ride followed by a 20-minute walk to get there.

   All the visitors love to say hello to the shika deers that roam freely
   in the park and often come for a little nosy (and in search of a
   snack!) even more so than in Miyajima. Here is a video we’ve made,
   which shows them in their natural environment:

   Nara was the capital of Japan for 74 years during the era of the same
   name (in the eighth century).

   Japan Sightseeing Guide » Kansai

Osaka

Kyoto’s rebellious neighbour

   After Tokyo and Yokohama, Osaka is the third largest city in Japan,
   with 2.66 million inhabitants. Located just a short distance from
   popular Kyoto, the economic capital of Kansai is often neglected by
   tourists.

   As Honshu’s transport hub and a hotspot for travel all over Japan, it
   has an extremely dense and well-developed transport network (at the
   western end of the famous Tokaido road), especially its airport, its
   Shinkansen station and its subway.

   However, Osaka seems to attract more visitors who are just passing
   through and don’t necessarily bother to seek out its attractions, of
   which there are many. Few know, for example, that it is home to the
   first Buddhist temple built in Japan by order of the emperor.

   By scratching the surface of its reputation as "Western Japan”, or even
   for being "dirty", you will discover a host of hidden wonders in Osaka,
   which we are going to try to help you discover and appreciate.

   Think about setting aside a few days in your itinerary to discover the
   charms of the beautiful city, which is too often overshadowed. And take
   the opportunity to meet its residents, who are definitely different to
   the rest of the Japanese!

   Wakayama prefecture, 100 kilometers south of Osaka. Koya-san is a
   well-known Buddhist pilgrimage site where travelers come for a
   religious and/or spiritual retreat in one of the 117 temples of the
   complex and across the Ryujin Quasi-National Park.

   Western tourists in Japan share with almost all of their foreign
   counterparts this understandable interest, especially for, Tokyo and
   Kyoto. But they often add this sometimes surprising fascination for
   Mount Koya, probably because of its constant appearance in classical
   paperback guides.

   On site, this flow of Western tourists is immediately recognizable by a
   rare specificity in Japan: the display of signs written and even the
   broadcast of vocal messages not only in English but also in several
   other Western languages (with the bonus of grammar and vocabulary
   mistakes!). During your travels, if you are looking to find peace and
   resource yourself far away from your roots, you may have to think about
   far-away places of Kii mounts, and avoid Koyasan as the main site, or
   you might be disappointed.

   In order to make it convenient, the journey to Koyasan is a
   well-organized and accessible small trip. Koya is nested directly south
   of Osaka, and therefore, the departure site is there. Count on
   two hours to reach the end of the train, cable car and bus trio. Once
   at the top of the peak, distances are quite short (the farther points
   of interests are only separated by a few kilometers), and it is
   possible to do everything by walking, allowing you to avoid a
   barely-working bus network.

Majestic attractions and temple lodgings

   The heart of the visit is the gorgeous walk to Okuno-in, the mausoleum
   of Kobo Daishi (Kukai), a 9th-century founder of Buddhism as we know it
   today in Japan. Do not be fooled in your path: if the original, typical
   path, offers a beautiful walk among the guardian summits of a cemetery
   that spreads out of sight, the other path is a vast, asphalted road
   without charm, constantly beaten down by a massive flow of
   tourist buses. We could have imagined something more authentic for the
   unofficial starting point of the 88 Shikoku temple pilgrimage.

   The other main attraction of Koyasan obviously remains Shukubo, an
   overnight stay in one of Koya-san's hundreds of Buddhist temples. It is
   absolutely possible to choose not to stay, therefore validating the
   possibility of enjoying the place in one full day. One can read the
   positives and negatives about spending a night in a temple: from
   delighted visitors of this authentic atmosphere, who enjoyed prayers at
   dawn and vegetarian food, to comments from people disgusted by an
   expensive experience and finally very (perhaps too much?) money-based
   visit by monks who consider you nothing more than a part of the rest of
   the flow of Western tourists they see all year long, and who end
   up selling souvenir products!

   The rest of the visit in Koya-san consists of several pretty points of
   interest, among which are Garan, Kongobu-ji and Daimon. Enough to spend
   a very good time there despite the massive groups of visitors,
   especially during the touristy season in spring and summer, which may
   prevent you from finding a calm and quiet time.

   As a good alternative, hiking in the Kii Mountains offers a more
   mystical and less-touristy approach when you are planning and the
   weather allows it. As often, the journey is worth more than the
   destination in this case.

Himeji

Kansai’s little feudal city

   Himeji is a small city located in the Kansai region's Hyogo prefecture,
   60 kilometers west of Kobe. Its newly renovated white castle, famous
   for being one of the last wooden castles on the archipelago, is the
   most frequented place in this touristy destination.

   Himeji’s main advantages for visitors are its small size and the
   location of its main attractions, which are all relatively close to the
   train station. This small city is the second most populated of the
   prefecture with 530,000 inhabitants, and is recognized for its castle
   that looks like a magnificent white heron.

   Even if the castle’s popularity holds much more weight than the rest of
   the city among tourists, and even more since its renovation in 2015, it
   is more interesting to spend a full day there to discover other
   charming places in Himeji, between Chogoku mountains in the north and
   the Seto Sea in the south.

   On the road from the train station and the castle, there are many
   arcades and stores spread throughout, including Miyuki Dori commercial
   street, similar to those seen in big cities of Japan such as Osaka or
   Hiroshima. Some boutiques are local, but most are souvenir stores with
   the same items from one to another, and usually quite expensive.

   Kokoen garden can be visited at the same time as the feudal structure,
   as it is located right next door. Consisting of 9 Japanese gardens, the
   promenade can be enjoyed on a total of 8.5 acres of greenery, perfectly
   cut and maintained since its public opening in 1992.

   Only a few minutes away from the castle by foot, the Fine Arts Museum
   can be recognized by its architecture, a former military compound with
   red brick walls, and renowned for its contemporary art, including from
   France and Belgium. Amateurs can continue their visit towards the
   literature center of Himeji, in a quiet neighborhood, which has the
   peculiar attraction of an observatory on its upper floor.

   By going outside of the city, on the northeast of the train station and
   up on a hill, Nagoyama cemetery offers a beautiful panoramic view on
   Himeji. It is home to a 38 meter high Buddhist tower, which can be seen
   from the surroundings and is, from a religious point of view, a stupa
   (rock dome home of Buddha ashes). These latter where offered by India
   as a symbol of peace.

   Up north, climbing Mount Shosha ends on the magnificent Engyo-ji
   temple, which is not very wel-known to foreign tourists, and therefore
   still mystical and relaxing for those taking a break there. Himeji is
   often used as a historical place for filming Japanese and foreign
   movies. At the end of the day, we recommend tasting a local sake, a
   specialty of the city.

Kobe

The harbor city

   Kobe is a harbor city, capital of Hyogo prefecture in the Kansai
   region, with more than 1.5 million inhabitants. Partially destroyed
   during the powerful 1995 earthquake, it is known today for its
   gastronomy with the famous Kobe beef.

   Sadly, the city is famous for the big earthquake which struck it on
   January 17th, 1995 with a magnitude of 7.2 on the Richter scale. The
   earthquake left impressive pictures, with more than ten thousands
   billions of Yens (~US$ 92,375,339,479.40) of material destruction and
   above all, killed 6,437 people according to the official count.

   Today, Kobe likes to welcome tourists across its various points of
   interests: the harbor and its famous tower, the vast district of
   Chinatown, or the hanging garden and the mountains overhanging the
   city, offering a large choice of hikes and a very famous onsen (Arima).

   Naturally, the gourmets will remind us that we know Kobe for being the
   place of the famous Kobe beef!
