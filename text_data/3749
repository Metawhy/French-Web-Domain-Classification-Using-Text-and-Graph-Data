   Every year 424,000 people die from falls and more than 37 million
   stumbles require medical attention. Those at the highest risk of death
   and injury from gravity's pull are those over 65.

   A group of biomedical engineers have developed this 'smart' robotic
   exoskeleton that automatically adapts to its wearer and tries to
   predict when a person is going to hit the deck.

Virtual reality training can stop the elderly from taking a tumble

   "This device is able to understand whether there is a change in
   locomotion behaviour – in particular at the onset of falling,"
   Silvestro Micera, the lead author of the research by École
   Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, tells WIRED. "It then generates
   torque (movement) at the hip of the subject in order to help the
   subject react to the starting of the falling event".

   Called the Active Pelvis Orthosis (APO), the exoskeleton has been
   designed to help prevent falls in the elderly, amputees and even those
   who live with Parkinson's disease. During the development of the lower
   body suit, Micera and colleagues tested the device on eight people –
   with an average age of 68.9 – and two amputees.

   Those involved in the test were asked to walk on a treadmill at their
   preferred speed while wearing a safety harness. However, the treadmill
   was custom-built and designed to move in multiple different directions,
   encouraging slips and falls.

   When a slip is detected the suit would move, based on the person's
   weight, and reposition their body into a position where the fall is
   less likely. It worked better on the elderly than those with
   amputations.

   Micera says that the device needs around three minutes to calibrate to
   an individual and can learn how a person walks in five steps. Sensors
   in the APO record how a person walks. "A simple algorithm, which
   according to your previous steps, predicts what your next kinematic
   activity will be," he says. "There's a threshold between what is
   predicted and what is detected. If this threshold goes over the system
   allowances and senses something is happening it will generate torque at
   the hip."

   The APO, which has been described and published in the journal Nature
   Health Sciences, was able to detect a person's fall in just 350
   milliseconds and doesn't require the wearer to be trained how to use
   the system. It is also said the algorithm used requires little
   personalisation to match the wearer.

   The team behind the work envisions the device being developed for the
   elderly and those suffering with mobility problems. Micera caveats the
   work by saying the exoskeleton needs to be tested in environments where
   the falls aren't choreographed. "The next step will be to test it
   overground in a more ecological and real-life situation," he adds.

   The Nature paper also adds that a "more focused design" would allow the
   wearable's weight and bulkiness to be reduced. This would be essential
   for any future commercial development, which would still be some time
   in the future.

   "Our findings demonstrate the potential of closed-loop controlled
   wearable robots to assist elderly and disabled subjects and to improve
   their quality of life," the research paper concludes.

   The method is the latest technological application designed to help the
   elderly stay on their feet. In August 2016, researchers at five
   universities in Belgium, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK to
   improve their walking using virtual reality.

   In the VR study 283 people – aged between 60 and 90 – with a history of
   falls were placed on a treadmill in front of a large screen. When they
   were asked to walk, obstacles appeared in their path walking training
   over a number of sessions improved their ability to stay upright.

TikTok is fuelling India's deadly hate speech epidemic

   In small-town India, TikTok videos are a new hate speech minefield.
   Thousands of videos are being removed as users exploit the wild growth
   of the social network

   New court documents reveal TikTok removed 48,000 videos promoting hate
   speech and violence in five months
   WIRED

   At 8:00pm on February 22, 2019, 28-year-old Venkataraman walked into a
   south Indian police station and confessed to strangling his friend
   Vijay to death with a scarf. But police in the state of Tamil Nadu had
   already been looking for Venkataraman for eight hours. Not for murder,
   but for uploading a 56-second video to TikTok.

   “Fight us if you are a real man, you Dalit dogs. You bastards are
   worthless in front of us. We’ll butcher you lowlifes,” a drunk
   Venkataraman rants in the selfie-style video, shot the day before the
   murder – a copy of which has been viewed by WIRED. He made the video
   after being encouraged by 18-year-old Vijay.

   The video’s aim was to insult people belonging to the Dalit group – the
   lowest position in India’s Hindu class ladder that’s known as the caste
   system. Dalits make up 17 per cent of India’s population and a crime
   against them is committed every 15 minutes.

   As Venkataraman’s video went viral, hundreds of angry people from the
   community that he abused blocked the roads and demanded action.
   Venkataraman, a bricklayer by profession, belongs to the Vanniyar
   community – a socially dominant group in Thalavedu.

   To subdue the fast-growing crowd, police brought charges of criminal
   intimidation, intentional insults and inciting violence against
   Venkataraman. “This calmed the mob a bit,” says P Saravanan, the deputy
   inspector at Tiruttani police station, which dealt with the case.

   Not expecting the massive backlash from the video, Venkataraman and
   Vijay went on the run. At 10:00am on February 22, still drunk on cheap
   local hooch, an argument broke out between the pair. They blamed each
   other for the mess, which quickly escalated into a fight.

   “I used the red scarf I carry around my neck to strangle and kill him.
   I turned his body face down and buried his head,” Saravanan recalls
   Venkataraman saying. Saravanan was the police official who took
   Venkataraman’s statement on the night of his arrest. The police report
   blames Vijay for the creation of the inflammatory video. “He was the
   one who came up with the idea. He was the reason for the mess,”
   Venkataraman told Saravanan.

   Vijay’s death went largely unnoticed. It took place in a remote part of
   India that most of the country’s 1.3 billion people wouldn’t be aware
   of. However, it demonstrates the rising tide of hate speech filled
   videos circulating on TikTok and the massive problems the company faces
   in the country.

   During June and July, WIRED identified more than 500 examples of
   caste-based hate, threats, violence and ridicule attacking different
   communities within the Tamil language on TikiTok. Users extol the
   virtues of specific castes and verbally attack local caste-leaders,
   which can trigger hate crimes.

   India’s caste structure is a feudal system of social division
   stratifying people into hierarchical groups based on their background
   and work. These include: priests, warriors, farmers/traders, labourers
   and outcasts. Dalits, formerly the ‘untouchables,’ fall outside the
   system and are widely persecuted.

   Videos found on TikTok include casteist-hate speech posted by users
   identifying themselves from high castes while celebrating and singing
   the praises of their communities. These quickly spill into threats of
   physical violence with members of some communities claiming dominance
   over other castes.

   “We must sever, not the fingers, but the heads of those who dare to lay
   their hands on us (our community),” one user says in a video,
   identifying himself as part of the Nadar community. Nadars have
   traditionally occupied a low status in the caste ladder but have risen
   through entrepreneurship. This video has been liked by thousands of
   users, and more than 89 videos have sprung up lip syncing to the
   speech.

   Another user shared a 15-second video responding to posts against his
   caste. “You Paraiyar dogs stab people in the back. Our courageous lot
   meet people face to face. I’ll chase each one of you Paraiyar down and
   slay you,” he says, identifying himself as a member of the Vanniyar
   community. Paraiyar is often used as a derogatory term to refer to
   Dalits. The user has several posts threatening Dalits and calls for
   people from his community to come together on TikTok.

   As WIRED sampled caste-based videos TikTok’s algorithm quickly caught
   on serving an endless trove of accounts advocating caste supremacy and
   casteist speech. Many of the videos were discoverable under caste
   hashtags like #nadar #vanniyar #thevar and #paraiyar – some had been
   viewed millions of times.

   Alongside the hate-fuelled videos, under the caste-linked hashtags, are
   videos of users lip syncing to popular movies and songs about their
   pride for their caste. The hashtags are also used by people on TikTok
   who criticise caste-based conversation. Videos promoting a ‘casteless’
   society sit alongside those propagating hate and caste-pride.

   WIRED shared a small sample of the videos containing content that
   potentially breaks TikTok’s community guidelines with the company.
   “TikTok promotes creativity – hateful or violent content has no place
   on our platform," a spokesperson said. "Our moderation team flags and
   removes problematic videos 24/7." The spokesperson adds that the
   company currently moderates videos in 15 different Indian languages.

   A spokesperson did not deny that the company faces challenges – like
   all other social platforms – with moderating hate speech but said its
   team had already seen some of the videos presented to it. “The team had
   identified the videos cited before WIRED contacted us and were in the
   removal process, but we continuously work to improve our capabilities
   to do even better,” the spokesperson said.

   However, court documents obtained by WIRED, which have not been made
   public before, show the extent that TikTok’s problem with hate speech
   in India. During the five months between November 31, 2018 and April
   19, 2019, the company removed 36,365 videos that breached its rules on
   hate speech and religion, and another 12,309 videos deemed to include
   dangerous behaviour and violence. The amount of hate speech and
   violence removed from TikTok outnumbers pornographic content by 20
   times.

   Over the five month period the documents reveal that 677,544 videos
   were reported to moderators and only one in ten of them (67,431) were
   removed for breaking TikTok’s guidelines. The number of videos reported
   accounted for just 0.00006 per cent of all those uploaded and only 1.01
   per cent of the accounts reported were banned.

   TikTok’s wild growth has caused its problems. The app, which boomed in
   China before entering India in September 2018, allows users to upload
   15 second videos set to catchy music, movie dialogues or voice-overs.
   It was originally called Musical.ly before ByteDance, one of the
   world's most highly valued startups purchased it for around $1 billion
   (£820 million) in November 2017 and rebranded it as TikTok.

   In India clips and footage related to the country’s vast movie industry
   are prominent on TikTok alongside teenagers uploading homemade dance
   videos, comedy skits, and taking part in hashtag challenges – such as
   the #bottlecapchallenge. They sit alongside influencers who command
   hundreds of thousands of followers and have helped propel it to an
   estimated 200m users in India, making the country one of its largest
   markets.

   The swell in user numbers has also made India one of TikTok’s most
   problematic markets. During the last six months there have been 18
   incidents – ten deaths and eight arrests – linked either directly or
   indirectly to the use of the app.

   Many of these have been accidents: a 22-year-old injured his spinal
   cord while attempting a backflip for a video; two people were killed in
   separate incidents after guns were fired; and one 20-year-old drowned
   while filming. Other serious incidents have been more disturbing. A
   mother of two recorded herself drinking poison and died of suicide
   after her husband claimed she had an additiction to the app. In another
   case, a man, separated from his wife is said to have stabbed her to
   death at her workplace for uploading videos on TikTok.

   But these are just the gruesome tip of the TikTok iceberg – they are
   rare among the millions of short videos uploaded every single day.
   Where the app is facing some of its most difficult troubles is in how
   it is being used to exacerbate existing tensions in local communities.

   Social divisions have run deep in India for centuries. But, the advent
   of easy-to-use video platforms, messaging apps and low mobile data
   limits, has seen hate speech targeting marginalised communities thrive.
   In April, police arrested a 21-year-old for uploading a caste-based
   video on TikTok that could have sparked communal unrest. And in another
   case, nine people were arrested for uploading a video inciting caste
   violence and potential public disorder.

   The problems created by TikTok haven’t gone unnoticed by lawmakers
   either. In April, a court ruling in Tamil Nadu – the region where Vijay
   died – said the app was spreading ‘pornographic’ and other
   ‘inappropriate’ content. As a result, Google and Apple took the largely
   unprecedented step to remove TikTok from their app stores at the
   request of the Indian court system. TikTok was only reinstated after
   more than six million videos were purged from the app.

   “TikTok is wreaking havoc on societies and villages in Tamil Nadu,”
   says lawyer K Neelamegam, who argued in favour of the TikTok ban in
   April. “It is extremely dangerous and playing an active part in
   disrupting peaceful functioning of our lives”. One Indian state
   information technology minister has also said TikTok is “degrading
   culture” and is “inimical to law and order”. And, India’s IT Ministry
   has threatened TikTok with a further ban for how it handles data and
   “anti-Indian” activity. It has demanded ByteDance answer a list of 24
   questions about how it works.

   TikTok's duet videos are often a basis for abuse videos
   TikTok

   TikTok’s current position in India is inevitable. As the company’s user
   base has quickly expanded, it has had to react to more problematic
   videos being posted to its platform. The feeling of community can drive
   people to act on what they see online.

   “We lip sync to songs and put up funny speeches of politicians,” says
   19-year-old Arun Kumar, who lives in the Thalavedu village – where
   18-year-old Vijay was murdered – and took part in the resulting
   protest. “But if we see a video dissing our community, we respond with
   a duet abusing them. We can’t be on the receiving side forever.”

   One common video type is users making a ‘duet’ with a 15-second clip
   urinating into a toilet next to videos of popular political icons. In
   another split-screen duel, Indian civil rights icon Bhimrao Ramji
   Ambedkar is shown alongside a clip pointing towards a rack full of worn
   out footwear, and the user wriggling a slipper as an insult. The video
   response showing footwear, was to demean Dalit users on TikTok
   celebrating a national figure.

   Duet’s have become an effective way of fanning the caste flames leading
   to outrage between entire caste groups. “Claims of being a part of a
   community and exerting superiority is the only thing that makes them
   feel powerful and popular,” says Kathir Vincent of Evidence, an
   organisation working to fight caste disrimination and promote social
   justice in India. “Most TikTok users in small towns work menial jobs
   and are bored. These videos help show the world (and the other castes)
   that they have done something heroic.”

   “We have received reports of caste-based videos on TikTok sparking
   unrest,” says cyber crime cell inspector Senthil Elanthirayan, who is
   based in Madurai, a city in the Tamil Nadu region. Elanthirayan refused
   to disclose the number of cases, castes involved, or locations of the
   reports, as they are still being investigated.

   TikTok says it takes hate speech seriously and has introduced safety
   centers to help educate users. The centers are websites, available in
   10 Indian languages, that advise on the app's policies, provide
   external resources tackling difficult issues and provide guidance
   around account privacy settings. But critics suggest the company has
   yet to do enough to tackle some of the issues it faces.

   “The problem with Tiktok is that they are not very open to advocacy or
   engaging with civil society. Not even to the standards of its American
   counterparts,” says Thenmozhi Soundararajan, executive director of
   Equality Labs, a South Asian human rights group. “I think they'd rather
   pay the fines and don't care.”

   In many cases it is the lack of moderators with adequate understanding
   of the sensitivities of the region that lets such content thrive, she
   adds. TikTok did not answer questions on how many moderators in India
   it employees but stated it has staff moderating content in 15 different
   languages. Previous reports say parent company ByteDance employs more
   than 250 people in India.

   The company does, however, point out that it is willing to work with
   civil society groups. In February, for Safer Internet Day, it worked
   with Indian NGO the Cyber Peace Foundation to host panels and talks
   around user safety and distributed posters advising on online safety to
   schools around the country. It has also introduced two in-app safety
   quizzes for its India users, the first of which it claimed has been
   seen by more than five million people.

   Inside the endless fight to kill the $1 trillion match-fixing industry

   At the moment though, it is unclear just how big TikTok’s hate speech
   problem is in India. While WIRED researched instances of hate speech in
   the Tamil language, Soudararajan says the issue is more pervasive. “We
   have actually reviewed casteist speech on TikTok in different north
   Indian languages as well.” She says videos relating to the Chamar
   community – a Dalit caste located in North India – are “very
   disturbing”. She and her team are currently researching and documenting
   casteist speech on TikTok in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu and plan to
   publish their results at the end of the year.

   The problem of hateful casteist speech and calls to violence against
   minorities on social media is not unique to TikTok. As social networks
   have seen rapid growth in India and other countries where internet
   penetration has sharply increased, they have all faced similar
   moderation issues and problems with user behaviour.

   A year-long research project conducted by Equality Labs found Facebook
   in India failed to remove 93 per cent of posts containing hate speech
   that violated its own rules. Other research has seen Facebook India
   being overrun by Islamophobic content.

   But perhaps the most controversial tech growth in India so far has been
   WhatsApp. The Facebook-owned messaging app has 400m users in the
   country and has been intrinsically linked to fake news, misinformation
   and violence spreading through its network.

   Rumours of child abductors have spread through WhatsApp and turned
   villages into lynch mobs. In one instance, verified by the BBC, a video
   produced by a child welfare group in Pakistan was mistakenly believed
   to show a kidnapping in India. It had been edited in such a way to
   remove the welfare group's message about keeping children safe. After
   the video was forwarded on WhatsApp, vigilante mobs formed and killed
   an estimated ten people.

   In response to the troubles, WhatsApp has limited how messages are
   forwarded, ran education programmes in the country and appointed a
   grievance officer. In February, TikTok followed this approach by saying
   it would hire a ‘nodal officer’ to work in India. The person would work
   with regulators and handle disputes arising in the country and was
   appointed earlier this year.

   Critics say it is crucial that technology companies expanding in India
   need to understand the complexities of the country. “All platforms
   including TikTok lack the cultural competency to enter our market with
   a clear understanding of the volatile nature of its internal dynamics,”
   says Soundararajan. “There is not a single platform that has cultural
   competencies related to caste and religious extremism.”

   Angry, hate-filled videos, can spill into real world repercussions. In
   Tamil Nadu, one teenager from Dharmapuri, travelled more than 200
   kilometres to face-off with an internet troll speaking ill of his
   community on TikTok.

   “This is for the coward Paraiyan who uses fake ID (to abuse me),” the
   user posted on June 27. “I have proved that I am a valourous Vanniyar.
   If you are courageous enough, come meet. I’ll be at the same spot,” he
   said. The user has built up a 12,000 plus following while uploading
   videos speaking about the supremacy of his community on TikTok.

How the crazy security for Trump's UK visit will cost us millions

   Four hours later, he posted another video celebrating his ‘victory’
   proclaiming he had honoured his caste and was leaving because of a no
   show from his opponent. The video had over a 1,000 likes and half a
   dozen downloads within minutes.

   The pent up anger of these type of videos plays out in the comments
   where users share mobile numbers and addresses to take the fight
   offline; meet in person and settle scores. It is unknown how many times
   users confront each other offline. TikTok says users can report videos
   which breach its community guidelines through settings within the app –
   court documents says TikTok responds to requests within 15 minutes on
   average. It also has a private email address where government and law
   enforcement officials can make takedown requests for objectionable
   content.

   “When you see so many casteist slurs, it makes it seem acceptable,”
   Soundararajan says. “Speech like this which normally be whispered in
   backroom, or in a direct threat in an atrocity prone area just moves it
   to the center and makes it more acceptable.''

   TikTok needs to conduct a civil rights audit, she says, to understand
   how hate speech spreads on its platform. After severe scrutiny,
   Facebook committed to an audit in September 2018 to understand
   censorship and how it may discriminate against minority groups. “This
   is as dangerous as a snapped live wire dangling, waiting for something
   more grave to happen,” Vincent says.

   During the court hearings surrounding TikTok’s app store ban, the
   company defended itself by saying it is crucial to free speech and
   people’s creativity. As the app continues to grow it is likely to face
   more scrutiny over its decisions.

   Police officer Saravanan worries that applying a broad interpretation
   to everything on TikTok would provide a veneer that can lead people to
   overlook potentially harmful side effects. “If you leave a gun on a
   table, it is partially your (TikTok) responsibility,” he says. “What we
   have now is leaving a gun chest open.”

   However, P Madhava Soma Sundaram, chairman of the Indian Society of
   Criminology begs to differ. “I will not blame Tiktok. This is a
   reflection of our society. The things that resonate with new internet
   users the most. It is very difficult to do adjudicate such content,” he
   says.

   “You cannot defeat casteism and supremacy by meeting it halfway. You
   have to be clear sighted about it. There are people and politicians who
   want to push the clash of castes for political mileage. The division
   can be overcome only through education till then moderation on social
   media is only meeting the problem half way,” he says.

Ford patents windshield movie screen for driverless cars

   The future heralded by driverless cars promises to be safer - mostly -
   but also, probably, a lot more boring. When you're not stuck in
   gridlock, the act of driving can be rather fun, so what to do when the
   car itself is doing that?

   If Ford has any say in it, you'll be kicking back and watching a movie
   on your windscreen while cruising down the motorway.

   The American motor company has filed a patent for an "Autonomous
   Vehicle Entertainment System" to be used in self-driving cars. In
   simple terms, that's a windscreen that turns into a 50-inch plus movie
   screen.

   From the accompanying image, Ford's mock-up envisages a drop-down
   projector screen as the main viewing method. Ford suggests that viewing
   material could be transferred to smaller screens when the driver is in
   control, "such as a display in the dashboard".

   The abstract for the patent, filed in the US at the start of March,
   describes this screen-switching feature in detail.

   It reads, "the entertainment system controller presents media content
   on a first display while the vehicle is operating in the autonomous
   mode and on a second display when the vehicle is operating in a
   non-autonomous mode. A method includes determining whether a vehicle is
   operating in an autonomous mode [....] and transferring presentation of
   the media content to a second display when the vehicle is operating in
   a non-autonomous mode."

   Although Ford is putting considerable effort into driverless cars (it's
   even pretty confident they won't kill people), in-car cinemas might be
   a bit further off. Ford spokesperson told Forbes "We submit patents on
   innovative ideas as a normal course of business. Patent applications
   are intended to protect new ideas but aren’t necessarily an indication
   of new business or product plans."

   It could be a while before you can kick back and watch Mad Max or play
   Rocket League from the comfort of your front seat, but with the idea
   out there and autonomous cars getting smarter, it may not actually be
   too far off.

The next media revolution will come from driverless cars

   Who'll want to listen to the radio when you could play Gran Turismo in
   the car?

   Driverless cars are here to stay, whether they are Elon Musk’s
   tenuously-funded Teslas or mainstream manufacturers’ more staid
   visions. As the world’s road safety experts and infrastructure
   specialists brace themselves for the coming storm, though, a long
   anticipated media revolution is also nearing: the advent of the ‘third
   living space’ in your car. The way we consume entertainment on the go
   is going to change drastically, and some giants stand to lose as a
   result.
   Integrated music streaming services already represent a serious threat
   to drive-time radio, as easily-connected smartphones offer drivers the
   playlists they actually want, rather than the ones chosen for them.
   Driverless cars will multiply this threat many times over, for one
   simple reason: instead of just listening, drivers and passengers will
   finally be able to watch video and play games.

When does a car become truly autonomous? Levels of self-driving technology

   If Ford have their way, these won’t just be on a small seat-back
   screen. The American car manufacturer has gone as far as patenting an
   “autonomous vehicle entertainment system’ which could effectively cover
   the windscreen with a projector screen, placing more emphasis than ever
   on being able to ignore the road.

   With Ford’s ongoing partnership with Amazon’s Alexa announced at CES
   this year, the people in the car won’t even have to move to pause their
   chosen show. The line between driver, passenger and audience will be
   blurred beyond recognition.
   In this context, with the people formerly known as drivers able to
   divert their full attention away from the road, it’s easy to see why
   radio stations might worry about their place in the entertainment
   equation. A generation is growing up seeing radio as less useful than
   Spotify, and video on demand could in turn overtake music streaming in
   cars. Traffic updates, phone-ins and local news reports struggle to
   assert themselves against personal mixes, let alone the temptation of
   an episode of Poldark.
   With streaming platforms already providing “pick up where you left off”
   services across multiple devices, such integrations don’t present
   overly complex technological challenges – compared to, for example,
   improvements to in-flight entertainment in recent years. And if radio
   will be challenged by video, both will be threatened by gaming. The
   heavy emphasis on portability and adaptability presented by the
   Nintendo Switch indicates yet more prescience by the Japanese giants.
   Cars with built-in console docks are a logical extension of the iPod
   adaptors and in-car DVD players of yore. Drivers could be speeding
   round the Nürburgring in Gran Turismo or throwing blue shells in Mario
   Kart, all while being driven around by a computer.
   If passengers do decide to look out of the window, augmented reality
   integration and heads up display technology will mean that in
   milliseconds the car could interpret a giant QR code on a billboard and
   use it to display a targeted advertisement. Just as we are used to
   personalised recommendations on our TVs and phones, we will become used
   to them in our cars. Why would Netflix want to show you a billboard for
   Orange is the New Black when they know from your account you gave up
   after three episodes?

   These developments represent major opportunities for growth and profit.
   Incentives to sign up to streaming services are just the beginning. In
   addition to standard revenue, a major reward for providers will come in
   the form of rich datasets, generated by the scale of this
   interconnectivity of activity – do users prefer short shows when
   driving in cities compared to rural routes? Are documentaries favoured
   over dramas by 4x4 owners, or puzzle games preferred to first person
   shooters by Silicon Valley drivers? All would become clear.
   As a result, processing data legally will be a major priority for
   providers. If a car manufacturer wanted to anonymously examine braking
   distance data to improve its software, then it would be surprising if
   it faced any issues. However, if an integrated food ordering app wished
   to analyse ordering trends using GPS data, and this data showed
   frequent trips to places of worship, for example, restrictions
   surrounding sensitive personal data may quickly come into play under
   current EU and domestic regulations – before any possible regulatory
   strengthening in the future.
   These sorts of legal pitfalls apply in myriad ways to the “rolling
   living room” of the future. AR advertisers will have to abide by laws
   to ensure they aren’t ambush marketing; entertainment platforms would
   have to be clear on their liability should a driver need to seize the
   wheel and fail to do so; licensing deals for exclusive rights in
   certain cars would need rigorous legal work to ratify – would, say, HBO
   be within its rights to give BMW drivers exclusive access to in-car
   Game of Thrones? As these situations become more pressing, governments
   are also likely to tighten regulations to guard against abuse, with
   penalties to match.
   Connected and autonomous cars do not have a ceiling in terms of
   potential at the moment; from shared lounges in limousines, to utterly
   immersive mobile virtual reality stations and independently travelling
   bookable meeting spaces, the sky is the limit. And this new horizon
   will be rife with opportunity for innovation and profit. It will play
   host to numerous battles, as industries compete for an in-car audience
   that was previously almost entirely dedicated to radio and music,
   fought with all the intensity of a high-stakes game of Call of Duty
   played on the M25.

This hack lets Amazon Echo 'remotely snoop' on users

   Amazon Echo is a voice-activated home audio speaker system, with a
   personal voice assistant, Alexa, to carry out your every need
   Amazon

   Every good paranoiac sees an always-listening device like an Amazon
   Echo as a potential spy sitting in plain sight. Now one security
   researcher has shown exactly how fine the line is between countertop
   computer and surveillance tool. With just a few minutes of hands-on
   time, a hacker could turn an Echo into a personal eavesdropping
   microphone without leaving any physical trace.

   On Tuesday, British security researcher Mark Barnes detailed a
   technique anyone can use to install malware on an Amazon Echo, along
   with his proof-of-concept code that would silently stream audio from
   the hacked device to his own faraway server. The technique requires
   gaining physical access to the target Echo, and it works only on
   devices sold before 2017. But there's no software fix for older units,
   Barnes warns, and the attack can be performed without leaving any sign
   of hardware intrusion.

   While that shouldn't raise alarms for every Echo owner that hackers are
   about to hijack their smart speaker, it does raise questions about the
   security of the devices, which are increasingly left in hotel rooms or
   offices, out of their owners' constant control.

Tapping the Echo

   "We present a technique for rooting an Amazon Echo and then turning it
   into a 'wiretap'," writes Barnes, who works as a security researcher
   for Basingstoke, UK-based MWR Labs. His write-up goes on to describe
   how he was able to install his own rogue software on the device, create
   a "root shell" that gives him access over the internet to the hacked
   Echo, and to "finally remotely snoop on its 'always listening'
   microphones."

   The method takes advantage of a physical security vulnerability Amazon
   left in its pre-2017 Echo units: Remove the rubber base of the device,
   and underneath hides a small grid of tiny metal pads that act as
   connections into its internal hardware, likely used for testing and
   fixing bugs in the devices before they were sold. One of those allows
   the Echo to read data from an SD card, for instance.

   So Barnes soldered his own connections to two of the tiny metal pads,
   one wired to his laptop and another to an SD card reader. Then he used
   Amazon's built-in functionality to load his own version of the Echo's
   so-called "bootloader"—the deep-seated software in some devices that
   tells them how to boot their own operating system—from his SD card,
   including tweaks that turned off the operating system's authentication
   measures and allowed him the privileges to install software on it.

   While the soldering took hours and left behind physical evidence – it
   would be hard to miss the wires sticking out everywhere—Barnes says
   that with a bit more development, the pads could just as easily be
   accessed with a purpose-built device that uses pins to connect to them
   directly and more cleanly achieves the same effect in minutes. In fact,
   an earlier paper by a group of researchers at the Citadel military
   academy in South Carolina identified the same pins, suggesting that
   hackers could use a 3D-printed attachment to connect to them.

   "You just peel off the little rubber base and you can access these pads
   straight away," Barnes explains. "You could make a device that would
   push onto the base, that you wouldn’t have to solder on, and that
   wouldn’t leave any obvious signs of manipulation."

   After gaining the ability to write his own software to the Echo, Barnes
   wrote a simple script that takes over its microphone functions and
   streams its audio to any remote computer he chooses. But he points out
   that his malware could just as easily perform other nasty functions,
   like using it as an access point to attack other parts of the network,
   stealing access to the owner's Amazon account, or installing
   ransomware. "You can make it do whatever you want, really," Barnes
   says.

Turn it off

   Amazon has fixed the security flaw Barnes exploited in its most recent
   version of the Echo, Barnes says, removing the external connection that
   allows access to its SD card. When WIRED reached out to Amazon for
   comment, the company wrote in a statement that "to help ensure the
   latest safeguards are in place, as a general rule, we recommend
   customers purchase Amazon devices from Amazon or a trusted retailer and
   that they keep their software up-to-date.”

   Barnes agrees that his work should serve as a warning that Echo devices
   bought from someone other than Amazon—like a secondhand seller—could be
   compromised. But he also points out that, contrary to the implication
   of the company's statement, no software update will protect earlier
   versions of the Echo, since the problem is in the physical connection
   its hardware exposes.

   Instead, he says that people should think twice about the security
   risks of using an Echo in public or semi-public places, like plans for
   the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas to put an Echo in every room. "In that
   case, you don’t really control who has access to the devices," Barnes
   says. "The previous guest could have installed something, the cleaner,
   whoever." The notion that intelligence services, for instance, might go
   to the effort to turn in-room devices into spying tools is more than
   paranoia: Documents released by WikiLeaks show that the CIA has
   explored similar physical-access techniques designed to turn Samsung
   smart televisions into eavesdropping devices.

   For those wary of a potentially compromised Echo, Barnes notes that
   they do have a Mute button that works as a hardware switch and isn't
   easily bypassed by malware. He recommends it. "If anyone pushes that
   mute button, I can’t unmute it in software," he says.

   And he offers a simpler solution too: "Just turn it off."

   Every year 424,000 people die from falls and more than 37 million
   stumbles require medical attention. Those at the highest risk of death
   and injury from gravity's pull are those over 65.

   A group of biomedical engineers have developed this 'smart' robotic
   exoskeleton that automatically adapts to its wearer and tries to
   predict when a person is going to hit the deck.

Virtual reality training can stop the elderly from taking a tumble

   "This device is able to understand whether there is a change in
   locomotion behaviour – in particular at the onset of falling,"
   Silvestro Micera, the lead author of the research by École
   Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, tells WIRED. "It then generates
   torque (movement) at the hip of the subject in order to help the
   subject react to the starting of the falling event".

   Called the Active Pelvis Orthosis (APO), the exoskeleton has been
   designed to help prevent falls in the elderly, amputees and even those
   who live with Parkinson's disease. During the development of the lower
   body suit, Micera and colleagues tested the device on eight people –
   with an average age of 68.9 – and two amputees.

   Those involved in the test were asked to walk on a treadmill at their
   preferred speed while wearing a safety harness. However, the treadmill
   was custom-built and designed to move in multiple different directions,
   encouraging slips and falls.

   When a slip is detected the suit would move, based on the person's
   weight, and reposition their body into a position where the fall is
   less likely. It worked better on the elderly than those with
   amputations.

   Micera says that the device needs around three minutes to calibrate to
   an individual and can learn how a person walks in five steps. Sensors
   in the APO record how a person walks. "A simple algorithm, which
   according to your previous steps, predicts what your next kinematic
   activity will be," he says. "There's a threshold between what is
   predicted and what is detected. If this threshold goes over the system
   allowances and senses something is happening it will generate torque at
   the hip."

   The APO, which has been described and published in the journal Nature
   Health Sciences, was able to detect a person's fall in just 350
   milliseconds and doesn't require the wearer to be trained how to use
   the system. It is also said the algorithm used requires little
   personalisation to match the wearer.

   The team behind the work envisions the device being developed for the
   elderly and those suffering with mobility problems. Micera caveats the
   work by saying the exoskeleton needs to be tested in environments where
   the falls aren't choreographed. "The next step will be to test it
   overground in a more ecological and real-life situation," he adds.

   The Nature paper also adds that a "more focused design" would allow the
   wearable's weight and bulkiness to be reduced. This would be essential
   for any future commercial development, which would still be some time
   in the future.

   "Our findings demonstrate the potential of closed-loop controlled
   wearable robots to assist elderly and disabled subjects and to improve
   their quality of life," the research paper concludes.

   The method is the latest technological application designed to help the
   elderly stay on their feet. In August 2016, researchers at five
   universities in Belgium, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK to
   improve their walking using virtual reality.

   In the VR study 283 people – aged between 60 and 90 – with a history of
   falls were placed on a treadmill in front of a large screen. When they
   were asked to walk, obstacles appeared in their path walking training
   over a number of sessions improved their ability to stay upright.

TikTok is fuelling India's deadly hate speech epidemic

   In small-town India, TikTok videos are a new hate speech minefield.
   Thousands of videos are being removed as users exploit the wild growth
   of the social network

   New court documents reveal TikTok removed 48,000 videos promoting hate
   speech and violence in five months
   WIRED

   At 8:00pm on February 22, 2019, 28-year-old Venkataraman walked into a
   south Indian police station and confessed to strangling his friend
   Vijay to death with a scarf. But police in the state of Tamil Nadu had
   already been looking for Venkataraman for eight hours. Not for murder,
   but for uploading a 56-second video to TikTok.

   “Fight us if you are a real man, you Dalit dogs. You bastards are
   worthless in front of us. We’ll butcher you lowlifes,” a drunk
   Venkataraman rants in the selfie-style video, shot the day before the
   murder – a copy of which has been viewed by WIRED. He made the video
   after being encouraged by 18-year-old Vijay.

   The video’s aim was to insult people belonging to the Dalit group – the
   lowest position in India’s Hindu class ladder that’s known as the caste
   system. Dalits make up 17 per cent of India’s population and a crime
   against them is committed every 15 minutes.

   As Venkataraman’s video went viral, hundreds of angry people from the
   community that he abused blocked the roads and demanded action.
   Venkataraman, a bricklayer by profession, belongs to the Vanniyar
   community – a socially dominant group in Thalavedu.

   To subdue the fast-growing crowd, police brought charges of criminal
   intimidation, intentional insults and inciting violence against
   Venkataraman. “This calmed the mob a bit,” says P Saravanan, the deputy
   inspector at Tiruttani police station, which dealt with the case.

   Not expecting the massive backlash from the video, Venkataraman and
   Vijay went on the run. At 10:00am on February 22, still drunk on cheap
   local hooch, an argument broke out between the pair. They blamed each
   other for the mess, which quickly escalated into a fight.

   “I used the red scarf I carry around my neck to strangle and kill him.
   I turned his body face down and buried his head,” Saravanan recalls
   Venkataraman saying. Saravanan was the police official who took
   Venkataraman’s statement on the night of his arrest. The police report
   blames Vijay for the creation of the inflammatory video. “He was the
   one who came up with the idea. He was the reason for the mess,”
   Venkataraman told Saravanan.

   Vijay’s death went largely unnoticed. It took place in a remote part of
   India that most of the country’s 1.3 billion people wouldn’t be aware
   of. However, it demonstrates the rising tide of hate speech filled
   videos circulating on TikTok and the massive problems the company faces
   in the country.

   During June and July, WIRED identified more than 500 examples of
   caste-based hate, threats, violence and ridicule attacking different
   communities within the Tamil language on TikiTok. Users extol the
   virtues of specific castes and verbally attack local caste-leaders,
   which can trigger hate crimes.

   India’s caste structure is a feudal system of social division
   stratifying people into hierarchical groups based on their background
   and work. These include: priests, warriors, farmers/traders, labourers
   and outcasts. Dalits, formerly the ‘untouchables,’ fall outside the
   system and are widely persecuted.

   Videos found on TikTok include casteist-hate speech posted by users
   identifying themselves from high castes while celebrating and singing
   the praises of their communities. These quickly spill into threats of
   physical violence with members of some communities claiming dominance
   over other castes.

   “We must sever, not the fingers, but the heads of those who dare to lay
   their hands on us (our community),” one user says in a video,
   identifying himself as part of the Nadar community. Nadars have
   traditionally occupied a low status in the caste ladder but have risen
   through entrepreneurship. This video has been liked by thousands of
   users, and more than 89 videos have sprung up lip syncing to the
   speech.

   Another user shared a 15-second video responding to posts against his
   caste. “You Paraiyar dogs stab people in the back. Our courageous lot
   meet people face to face. I’ll chase each one of you Paraiyar down and
   slay you,” he says, identifying himself as a member of the Vanniyar
   community. Paraiyar is often used as a derogatory term to refer to
   Dalits. The user has several posts threatening Dalits and calls for
   people from his community to come together on TikTok.

   As WIRED sampled caste-based videos TikTok’s algorithm quickly caught
   on serving an endless trove of accounts advocating caste supremacy and
   casteist speech. Many of the videos were discoverable under caste
   hashtags like #nadar #vanniyar #thevar and #paraiyar – some had been
   viewed millions of times.

   Alongside the hate-fuelled videos, under the caste-linked hashtags, are
   videos of users lip syncing to popular movies and songs about their
   pride for their caste. The hashtags are also used by people on TikTok
   who criticise caste-based conversation. Videos promoting a ‘casteless’
   society sit alongside those propagating hate and caste-pride.

   WIRED shared a small sample of the videos containing content that
   potentially breaks TikTok’s community guidelines with the company.
   “TikTok promotes creativity – hateful or violent content has no place
   on our platform," a spokesperson said. "Our moderation team flags and
   removes problematic videos 24/7." The spokesperson adds that the
   company currently moderates videos in 15 different Indian languages.

   A spokesperson did not deny that the company faces challenges – like
   all other social platforms – with moderating hate speech but said its
   team had already seen some of the videos presented to it. “The team had
   identified the videos cited before WIRED contacted us and were in the
   removal process, but we continuously work to improve our capabilities
   to do even better,” the spokesperson said.

   However, court documents obtained by WIRED, which have not been made
   public before, show the extent that TikTok’s problem with hate speech
   in India. During the five months between November 31, 2018 and April
   19, 2019, the company removed 36,365 videos that breached its rules on
   hate speech and religion, and another 12,309 videos deemed to include
   dangerous behaviour and violence. The amount of hate speech and
   violence removed from TikTok outnumbers pornographic content by 20
   times.

   Over the five month period the documents reveal that 677,544 videos
   were reported to moderators and only one in ten of them (67,431) were
   removed for breaking TikTok’s guidelines. The number of videos reported
   accounted for just 0.00006 per cent of all those uploaded and only 1.01
   per cent of the accounts reported were banned.

   TikTok’s wild growth has caused its problems. The app, which boomed in
   China before entering India in September 2018, allows users to upload
   15 second videos set to catchy music, movie dialogues or voice-overs.
   It was originally called Musical.ly before ByteDance, one of the
   world's most highly valued startups purchased it for around $1 billion
   (£820 million) in November 2017 and rebranded it as TikTok.

   In India clips and footage related to the country’s vast movie industry
   are prominent on TikTok alongside teenagers uploading homemade dance
   videos, comedy skits, and taking part in hashtag challenges – such as
   the #bottlecapchallenge. They sit alongside influencers who command
   hundreds of thousands of followers and have helped propel it to an
   estimated 200m users in India, making the country one of its largest
   markets.

   The swell in user numbers has also made India one of TikTok’s most
   problematic markets. During the last six months there have been 18
   incidents – ten deaths and eight arrests – linked either directly or
   indirectly to the use of the app.

   Many of these have been accidents: a 22-year-old injured his spinal
   cord while attempting a backflip for a video; two people were killed in
   separate incidents after guns were fired; and one 20-year-old drowned
   while filming. Other serious incidents have been more disturbing. A
   mother of two recorded herself drinking poison and died of suicide
   after her husband claimed she had an additiction to the app. In another
   case, a man, separated from his wife is said to have stabbed her to
   death at her workplace for uploading videos on TikTok.

   But these are just the gruesome tip of the TikTok iceberg – they are
   rare among the millions of short videos uploaded every single day.
   Where the app is facing some of its most difficult troubles is in how
   it is being used to exacerbate existing tensions in local communities.

   Social divisions have run deep in India for centuries. But, the advent
   of easy-to-use video platforms, messaging apps and low mobile data
   limits, has seen hate speech targeting marginalised communities thrive.
   In April, police arrested a 21-year-old for uploading a caste-based
   video on TikTok that could have sparked communal unrest. And in another
   case, nine people were arrested for uploading a video inciting caste
   violence and potential public disorder.

   The problems created by TikTok haven’t gone unnoticed by lawmakers
   either. In April, a court ruling in Tamil Nadu – the region where Vijay
   died – said the app was spreading ‘pornographic’ and other
   ‘inappropriate’ content. As a result, Google and Apple took the largely
   unprecedented step to remove TikTok from their app stores at the
   request of the Indian court system. TikTok was only reinstated after
   more than six million videos were purged from the app.

   “TikTok is wreaking havoc on societies and villages in Tamil Nadu,”
   says lawyer K Neelamegam, who argued in favour of the TikTok ban in
   April. “It is extremely dangerous and playing an active part in
   disrupting peaceful functioning of our lives”. One Indian state
   information technology minister has also said TikTok is “degrading
   culture” and is “inimical to law and order”. And, India’s IT Ministry
   has threatened TikTok with a further ban for how it handles data and
   “anti-Indian” activity. It has demanded ByteDance answer a list of 24
   questions about how it works.

New data reveals hackers make huge sums from sexual blackmail

   TikTok's duet videos are often a basis for abuse videos
   TikTok

   TikTok’s current position in India is inevitable. As the company’s user
   base has quickly expanded, it has had to react to more problematic
   videos being posted to its platform. The feeling of community can drive
   people to act on what they see online.

   “We lip sync to songs and put up funny speeches of politicians,” says
   19-year-old Arun Kumar, who lives in the Thalavedu village – where
   18-year-old Vijay was murdered – and took part in the resulting
   protest. “But if we see a video dissing our community, we respond with
   a duet abusing them. We can’t be on the receiving side forever.”

   One common video type is users making a ‘duet’ with a 15-second clip
   urinating into a toilet next to videos of popular political icons. In
   another split-screen duel, Indian civil rights icon Bhimrao Ramji
   Ambedkar is shown alongside a clip pointing towards a rack full of worn
   out footwear, and the user wriggling a slipper as an insult. The video
   response showing footwear, was to demean Dalit users on TikTok
   celebrating a national figure.

   Duet’s have become an effective way of fanning the caste flames leading
   to outrage between entire caste groups. “Claims of being a part of a
   community and exerting superiority is the only thing that makes them
   feel powerful and popular,” says Kathir Vincent of Evidence, an
   organisation working to fight caste disrimination and promote social
   justice in India. “Most TikTok users in small towns work menial jobs
   and are bored. These videos help show the world (and the other castes)
   that they have done something heroic.”

   “We have received reports of caste-based videos on TikTok sparking
   unrest,” says cyber crime cell inspector Senthil Elanthirayan, who is
   based in Madurai, a city in the Tamil Nadu region. Elanthirayan refused
   to disclose the number of cases, castes involved, or locations of the
   reports, as they are still being investigated.

   TikTok says it takes hate speech seriously and has introduced safety
   centers to help educate users. The centers are websites, available in
   10 Indian languages, that advise on the app's policies, provide
   external resources tackling difficult issues and provide guidance
   around account privacy settings. But critics suggest the company has
   yet to do enough to tackle some of the issues it faces.

   “The problem with Tiktok is that they are not very open to advocacy or
   engaging with civil society. Not even to the standards of its American
   counterparts,” says Thenmozhi Soundararajan, executive director of
   Equality Labs, a South Asian human rights group. “I think they'd rather
   pay the fines and don't care.”

   In many cases it is the lack of moderators with adequate understanding
   of the sensitivities of the region that lets such content thrive, she
   adds. TikTok did not answer questions on how many moderators in India
   it employees but stated it has staff moderating content in 15 different
   languages. Previous reports say parent company ByteDance employs more
   than 250 people in India.

   The company does, however, point out that it is willing to work with
   civil society groups. In February, for Safer Internet Day, it worked
   with Indian NGO the Cyber Peace Foundation to host panels and talks
   around user safety and distributed posters advising on online safety to
   schools around the country. It has also introduced two in-app safety
   quizzes for its India users, the first of which it claimed has been
   seen by more than five million people.

   Inside the endless fight to kill the $1 trillion match-fixing industry

Inside the endless fight to kill the $1 trillion match-fixing industry

   At the moment though, it is unclear just how big TikTok’s hate speech
   problem is in India. While WIRED researched instances of hate speech in
   the Tamil language, Soudararajan says the issue is more pervasive. “We
   have actually reviewed casteist speech on TikTok in different north
   Indian languages as well.” She says videos relating to the Chamar
   community – a Dalit caste located in North India – are “very
   disturbing”. She and her team are currently researching and documenting
   casteist speech on TikTok in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu and plan to
   publish their results at the end of the year.

   The problem of hateful casteist speech and calls to violence against
   minorities on social media is not unique to TikTok. As social networks
   have seen rapid growth in India and other countries where internet
   penetration has sharply increased, they have all faced similar
   moderation issues and problems with user behaviour.

   A year-long research project conducted by Equality Labs found Facebook
   in India failed to remove 93 per cent of posts containing hate speech
   that violated its own rules. Other research has seen Facebook India
   being overrun by Islamophobic content.

   But perhaps the most controversial tech growth in India so far has been
   WhatsApp. The Facebook-owned messaging app has 400m users in the
   country and has been intrinsically linked to fake news, misinformation
   and violence spreading through its network.

   Rumours of child abductors have spread through WhatsApp and turned
   villages into lynch mobs. In one instance, verified by the BBC, a video
   produced by a child welfare group in Pakistan was mistakenly believed
   to show a kidnapping in India. It had been edited in such a way to
   remove the welfare group's message about keeping children safe. After
   the video was forwarded on WhatsApp, vigilante mobs formed and killed
   an estimated ten people.

   In response to the troubles, WhatsApp has limited how messages are
   forwarded, ran education programmes in the country and appointed a
   grievance officer. In February, TikTok followed this approach by saying
   it would hire a ‘nodal officer’ to work in India. The person would work
   with regulators and handle disputes arising in the country and was
   appointed earlier this year.

   Critics say it is crucial that technology companies expanding in India
   need to understand the complexities of the country. “All platforms
   including TikTok lack the cultural competency to enter our market with
   a clear understanding of the volatile nature of its internal dynamics,”
   says Soundararajan. “There is not a single platform that has cultural
   competencies related to caste and religious extremism.”

   Angry, hate-filled videos, can spill into real world repercussions. In
   Tamil Nadu, one teenager from Dharmapuri, travelled more than 200
   kilometres to face-off with an internet troll speaking ill of his
   community on TikTok.

   “This is for the coward Paraiyan who uses fake ID (to abuse me),” the
   user posted on June 27. “I have proved that I am a valourous Vanniyar.
   If you are courageous enough, come meet. I’ll be at the same spot,” he
   said. The user has built up a 12,000 plus following while uploading
   videos speaking about the supremacy of his community on TikTok.

How the crazy security for Trump's UK visit will cost us millions

   Four hours later, he posted another video celebrating his ‘victory’
   proclaiming he had honoured his caste and was leaving because of a no
   show from his opponent. The video had over a 1,000 likes and half a
   dozen downloads within minutes.

   The pent up anger of these type of videos plays out in the comments
   where users share mobile numbers and addresses to take the fight
   offline; meet in person and settle scores. It is unknown how many times
   users confront each other offline. TikTok says users can report videos
   which breach its community guidelines through settings within the app –
   court documents says TikTok responds to requests within 15 minutes on
   average. It also has a private email address where government and law
   enforcement officials can make takedown requests for objectionable
   content.

   “When you see so many casteist slurs, it makes it seem acceptable,”
   Soundararajan says. “Speech like this which normally be whispered in
   backroom, or in a direct threat in an atrocity prone area just moves it
   to the center and makes it more acceptable.''

   TikTok needs to conduct a civil rights audit, she says, to understand
   how hate speech spreads on its platform. After severe scrutiny,
   Facebook committed to an audit in September 2018 to understand
   censorship and how it may discriminate against minority groups. “This
   is as dangerous as a snapped live wire dangling, waiting for something
   more grave to happen,” Vincent says.

   During the court hearings surrounding TikTok’s app store ban, the
   company defended itself by saying it is crucial to free speech and
   people’s creativity. As the app continues to grow it is likely to face
   more scrutiny over its decisions.

   Police officer Saravanan worries that applying a broad interpretation
   to everything on TikTok would provide a veneer that can lead people to
   overlook potentially harmful side effects. “If you leave a gun on a
   table, it is partially your (TikTok) responsibility,” he says. “What we
   have now is leaving a gun chest open.”

   However, P Madhava Soma Sundaram, chairman of the Indian Society of
   Criminology begs to differ. “I will not blame Tiktok. This is a
   reflection of our society. The things that resonate with new internet
   users the most. It is very difficult to do adjudicate such content,” he
   says.

   “You cannot defeat casteism and supremacy by meeting it halfway. You
   have to be clear sighted about it. There are people and politicians who
   want to push the clash of castes for political mileage. The division
   can be overcome only through education till then moderation on social
   media is only meeting the problem half way,” he says.

Ford patents windshield movie screen for driverless cars

   The future heralded by driverless cars promises to be safer - mostly -
   but also, probably, a lot more boring. When you're not stuck in
   gridlock, the act of driving can be rather fun, so what to do when the
   car itself is doing that?

   If Ford has any say in it, you'll be kicking back and watching a movie
   on your windscreen while cruising down the motorway.

   The American motor company has filed a patent for an "Autonomous
   Vehicle Entertainment System" to be used in self-driving cars. In
   simple terms, that's a windscreen that turns into a 50-inch plus movie
   screen.

   From the accompanying image, Ford's mock-up envisages a drop-down
   projector screen as the main viewing method. Ford suggests that viewing
   material could be transferred to smaller screens when the driver is in
   control, "such as a display in the dashboard".

   The abstract for the patent, filed in the US at the start of March,
   describes this screen-switching feature in detail.

   It reads, "the entertainment system controller presents media content
   on a first display while the vehicle is operating in the autonomous
   mode and on a second display when the vehicle is operating in a
   non-autonomous mode. A method includes determining whether a vehicle is
   operating in an autonomous mode [....] and transferring presentation of
   the media content to a second display when the vehicle is operating in
   a non-autonomous mode."

   Although Ford is putting considerable effort into driverless cars (it's
   even pretty confident they won't kill people), in-car cinemas might be
   a bit further off. Ford spokesperson told Forbes "We submit patents on
   innovative ideas as a normal course of business. Patent applications
   are intended to protect new ideas but aren’t necessarily an indication
   of new business or product plans."

   It could be a while before you can kick back and watch Mad Max or play
   Rocket League from the comfort of your front seat, but with the idea
   out there and autonomous cars getting smarter, it may not actually be
   too far off.

The next media revolution will come from driverless cars

   Who'll want to listen to the radio when you could play Gran Turismo in
   the car?

   Driverless cars are here to stay, whether they are Elon Musk’s
   tenuously-funded Teslas or mainstream manufacturers’ more staid
   visions. As the world’s road safety experts and infrastructure
   specialists brace themselves for the coming storm, though, a long
   anticipated media revolution is also nearing: the advent of the ‘third
   living space’ in your car. The way we consume entertainment on the go
   is going to change drastically, and some giants stand to lose as a
   result.
   Integrated music streaming services already represent a serious threat
   to drive-time radio, as easily-connected smartphones offer drivers the
   playlists they actually want, rather than the ones chosen for them.
   Driverless cars will multiply this threat many times over, for one
   simple reason: instead of just listening, drivers and passengers will
   finally be able to watch video and play games.

When does a car become truly autonomous? Levels of self-driving technology

   If Ford have their way, these won’t just be on a small seat-back
   screen. The American car manufacturer has gone as far as patenting an
   “autonomous vehicle entertainment system’ which could effectively cover
   the windscreen with a projector screen, placing more emphasis than ever
   on being able to ignore the road.

   With Ford’s ongoing partnership with Amazon’s Alexa announced at CES
   this year, the people in the car won’t even have to move to pause their
   chosen show. The line between driver, passenger and audience will be
   blurred beyond recognition.
   In this context, with the people formerly known as drivers able to
   divert their full attention away from the road, it’s easy to see why
   radio stations might worry about their place in the entertainment
   equation. A generation is growing up seeing radio as less useful than
   Spotify, and video on demand could in turn overtake music streaming in
   cars. Traffic updates, phone-ins and local news reports struggle to
   assert themselves against personal mixes, let alone the temptation of
   an episode of Poldark.
   With streaming platforms already providing “pick up where you left off”
   services across multiple devices, such integrations don’t present
   overly complex technological challenges – compared to, for example,
   improvements to in-flight entertainment in recent years. And if radio
   will be challenged by video, both will be threatened by gaming. The
   heavy emphasis on portability and adaptability presented by the
   Nintendo Switch indicates yet more prescience by the Japanese giants.
   Cars with built-in console docks are a logical extension of the iPod
   adaptors and in-car DVD players of yore. Drivers could be speeding
   round the Nürburgring in Gran Turismo or throwing blue shells in Mario
   Kart, all while being driven around by a computer.
   If passengers do decide to look out of the window, augmented reality
   integration and heads up display technology will mean that in
   milliseconds the car could interpret a giant QR code on a billboard and
   use it to display a targeted advertisement. Just as we are used to
   personalised recommendations on our TVs and phones, we will become used
   to them in our cars. Why would Netflix want to show you a billboard for
   Orange is the New Black when they know from your account you gave up
   after three episodes?

   These developments represent major opportunities for growth and profit.
   Incentives to sign up to streaming services are just the beginning. In
   addition to standard revenue, a major reward for providers will come in
   the form of rich datasets, generated by the scale of this
   interconnectivity of activity – do users prefer short shows when
   driving in cities compared to rural routes? Are documentaries favoured
   over dramas by 4x4 owners, or puzzle games preferred to first person
   shooters by Silicon Valley drivers? All would become clear.
   As a result, processing data legally will be a major priority for
   providers. If a car manufacturer wanted to anonymously examine braking
   distance data to improve its software, then it would be surprising if
   it faced any issues. However, if an integrated food ordering app wished
   to analyse ordering trends using GPS data, and this data showed
   frequent trips to places of worship, for example, restrictions
   surrounding sensitive personal data may quickly come into play under
   current EU and domestic regulations – before any possible regulatory
   strengthening in the future.
   These sorts of legal pitfalls apply in myriad ways to the “rolling
   living room” of the future. AR advertisers will have to abide by laws
   to ensure they aren’t ambush marketing; entertainment platforms would
   have to be clear on their liability should a driver need to seize the
   wheel and fail to do so; licensing deals for exclusive rights in
   certain cars would need rigorous legal work to ratify – would, say, HBO
   be within its rights to give BMW drivers exclusive access to in-car
   Game of Thrones? As these situations become more pressing, governments
   are also likely to tighten regulations to guard against abuse, with
   penalties to match.
   Connected and autonomous cars do not have a ceiling in terms of
   potential at the moment; from shared lounges in limousines, to utterly
   immersive mobile virtual reality stations and independently travelling
   bookable meeting spaces, the sky is the limit. And this new horizon
   will be rife with opportunity for innovation and profit. It will play
   host to numerous battles, as industries compete for an in-car audience
   that was previously almost entirely dedicated to radio and music,
   fought with all the intensity of a high-stakes game of Call of Duty
   played on the M25.

This hack lets Amazon Echo 'remotely snoop' on users

   Alexa's always listening but this time it's not a good thing

   Amazon Echo is a voice-activated home audio speaker system, with a
   personal voice assistant, Alexa, to carry out your every need
   Amazon

   Every good paranoiac sees an always-listening device like an Amazon
   Echo as a potential spy sitting in plain sight. Now one security
   researcher has shown exactly how fine the line is between countertop
   computer and surveillance tool. With just a few minutes of hands-on
   time, a hacker could turn an Echo into a personal eavesdropping
   microphone without leaving any physical trace.

What can Alexa do? The best Alexa skills and commands

   On Tuesday, British security researcher Mark Barnes detailed a
   technique anyone can use to install malware on an Amazon Echo, along
   with his proof-of-concept code that would silently stream audio from
   the hacked device to his own faraway server. The technique requires
   gaining physical access to the target Echo, and it works only on
   devices sold before 2017. But there's no software fix for older units,
   Barnes warns, and the attack can be performed without leaving any sign
   of hardware intrusion.

   While that shouldn't raise alarms for every Echo owner that hackers are
   about to hijack their smart speaker, it does raise questions about the
   security of the devices, which are increasingly left in hotel rooms or
   offices, out of their owners' constant control.

Tapping the Echo

   "We present a technique for rooting an Amazon Echo and then turning it
   into a 'wiretap'," writes Barnes, who works as a security researcher
   for Basingstoke, UK-based MWR Labs. His write-up goes on to describe
   how he was able to install his own rogue software on the device, create
   a "root shell" that gives him access over the internet to the hacked
   Echo, and to "finally remotely snoop on its 'always listening'
   microphones."

   The method takes advantage of a physical security vulnerability Amazon
   left in its pre-2017 Echo units: Remove the rubber base of the device,
   and underneath hides a small grid of tiny metal pads that act as
   connections into its internal hardware, likely used for testing and
   fixing bugs in the devices before they were sold. One of those allows
   the Echo to read data from an SD card, for instance.

   So Barnes soldered his own connections to two of the tiny metal pads,
   one wired to his laptop and another to an SD card reader. Then he used
   Amazon's built-in functionality to load his own version of the Echo's
   so-called "bootloader"—the deep-seated software in some devices that
   tells them how to boot their own operating system—from his SD card,
   including tweaks that turned off the operating system's authentication
   measures and allowed him the privileges to install software on it.

   While the soldering took hours and left behind physical evidence – it
   would be hard to miss the wires sticking out everywhere—Barnes says
   that with a bit more development, the pads could just as easily be
   accessed with a purpose-built device that uses pins to connect to them
   directly and more cleanly achieves the same effect in minutes. In fact,
   an earlier paper by a group of researchers at the Citadel military
   academy in South Carolina identified the same pins, suggesting that
   hackers could use a 3D-printed attachment to connect to them.

   "You just peel off the little rubber base and you can access these pads
   straight away," Barnes explains. "You could make a device that would
   push onto the base, that you wouldn’t have to solder on, and that
   wouldn’t leave any obvious signs of manipulation."

   After gaining the ability to write his own software to the Echo, Barnes
   wrote a simple script that takes over its microphone functions and
   streams its audio to any remote computer he chooses. But he points out
   that his malware could just as easily perform other nasty functions,
   like using it as an access point to attack other parts of the network,
   stealing access to the owner's Amazon account, or installing
   ransomware. "You can make it do whatever you want, really," Barnes
   says.

Turn it off

   Amazon has fixed the security flaw Barnes exploited in its most recent
   version of the Echo, Barnes says, removing the external connection that
   allows access to its SD card. When WIRED reached out to Amazon for
   comment, the company wrote in a statement that "to help ensure the
   latest safeguards are in place, as a general rule, we recommend
   customers purchase Amazon devices from Amazon or a trusted retailer and
   that they keep their software up-to-date.”

   Barnes agrees that his work should serve as a warning that Echo devices
   bought from someone other than Amazon—like a secondhand seller—could be
   compromised. But he also points out that, contrary to the implication
   of the company's statement, no software update will protect earlier
   versions of the Echo, since the problem is in the physical connection
   its hardware exposes.

   Instead, he says that people should think twice about the security
   risks of using an Echo in public or semi-public places, like plans for
   the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas to put an Echo in every room. "In that
   case, you don’t really control who has access to the devices," Barnes
   says. "The previous guest could have installed something, the cleaner,
   whoever." The notion that intelligence services, for instance, might go
   to the effort to turn in-room devices into spying tools is more than
   paranoia: Documents released by WikiLeaks show that the CIA has
   explored similar physical-access techniques designed to turn Samsung
   smart televisions into eavesdropping devices.

   For those wary of a potentially compromised Echo, Barnes notes that
   they do have a Mute button that works as a hardware switch and isn't
   easily bypassed by malware. He recommends it. "If anyone pushes that
   mute button, I can’t unmute it in software," he says.

   And he offers a simpler solution too: "Just turn it off."
