Anyone for Tennis?

   fdrlibrary:

     For the next two weeks, the FDR Library will be celebrating tennis
     history in honor of the President’s first cousins, Ellen and Grace
     Roosevelt, pictured here (Ellen, left, and Grace, right).
     image

     Ellen won the 1890 singles title and shared the doubles championship
     that year with her sister Grace. Ellen paired with Clarence Hobart
     in 1893 to take the mixed doubles title. Hobart found romance with
     another mixed doubles partner and won the championship with his wife
     Augusta Schultz in 1905.

     Ellen and her sister Grace were fierce competitors, belying the
     notion that early women’s tennis was merely a genteel past-time for
     elegant ladies. They actively competed in championships both at
     tennis clubs in the Hudson Valley (where they resided not far from
     Springwood, FDR’s birthplace and home) and in tennis centers like
     Newport and Narragansett, Rhode Island (photo: at play in
     Narragansett, Rhode Island).
     image

     Photos of Ellen and Grace donated by their family after Ellen’s
     death in 1954 document the early history of the game in the United
     States. These images include Ellen and Grace in formal portraits as
     well as in match play. Some images may have been taken by Ellen or
     Grace or by their father John Aspinwall Roosevelt, FDR’s uncle.
     image

     Many have never been seen by a wide audience and may be the only
     photos of early US championship tennis.

     The men’s match shown in this photograph is one of several in our
     collection documenting the 1887 men’s championships between Richard
     D. Sears and Henry Slocum on August 30, 1887 at the Newport Casino
     in Newport, Rhode Island. These may be the only extant photographs
     of the match in play. Sears defeated Slocum in straight sets (6-1,
     6-3, 6-2). Sears won the first seven US National Championships, all
     contested on grass, in Newport.

     Remembering John Paul Stevens, 1920-2019

     We are sad to mark the passing of Supreme Court Justice John Paul
     Stevens earlier this week at age 99. He was the third longest
     serving justice at the time of his retirement in June 2010, just
     under 35 years after President Ford appointed him to the Supreme
     Court.

     Born in Chicago, Stevens graduated from the University of Chicago in
     1941. He served in the Navy during World War II as an intelligence
     officer in the Pacific Theater. After the war he attended
     Northwestern University School of Law and graduated first in his
     class. Stevens then served as a law clerk to Supreme Court Justice
     Wiley Rutledge before entering private practice. He worked for law
     firms in the Chicago area, including one he helped form, for many
     years, dealing mostly with litigation and antitrust law.
     Additionally, he taught law classes part time and gained experience
     serving as counsel on Federal committees.

     Stevens became a United States Circuit Judge for the Seventh Circuit
     Court of Appeals in October 1970. He served in that capacity until
     November 1975 when President Ford nominated him to fill the Supreme
     Court vacancy created by the retirement of Justice William O.
     Douglass. “Judge Stevens is held in the highest esteem by his
     colleagues in the legal profession and the Judiciary and has had an
     outstanding career in the practice and the teaching of law as well
     as on the Federal Bench,” President Ford said in his nomination
     remarks. “I am confident that he will bring both professional and
     personal qualities of the highest order to the Supreme Court.”

     The Senate quickly confirmed Stevens with a vote of 98-0 and he took
     his seat on the bench on December 19, 1975. Although he was
     registered as a Republican when he was appointed, over time he
     became viewed as part of the liberal wing of the Supreme Court.
     President Ford never regretted nominating Stevens. “He has served
     his nation well, at all times carrying out his judicial duties with
     dignity, intellect, and without partisan political concerns. Justice
     Stevens has made me, and our fellow citizens, proud of my three
     decade old decision to appoint him to the Supreme Court,” President
     Ford wrote in a letter honoring Justice Stevens in 2005. Stevens
     received a copy of the letter, which he reportedly displayed in his
     Supreme Court chambers.

     Read historian Richard Norton Smith’s interview with John Paul
     Stevens from the Ford Presidential Foundation’s Gerald R. Ford Oral
     History Project.

     With the signing of the United States Constitution on September 17,
     1787, the founding fathers approved for the people of this Nation an
     effective plan of self-government, which has, with its subsequent
     amendments – including the Bill of Rights – preserved the principles
     of the Declaration of Independence. It is the responsibility of the
     citizens of the United States to uphold, support and defend those
     ideals.

     – President Ford’s Proclamation for Citizenship Day and Constitution
     Week, 1976

     Constitution Day and Citizenship Day commemorates the signing of the
     Constitution, and encourages people to learn more about their rights
     and responsibilities as citizens of the United States.

     The Constitution is on permanent display year round at the U.S.
     National Archives in Washington, DC. Read the full transcription of
     it on the National Archives website. Explore additional resources
     for learning and teaching about the Constitution from the National
     Archives Education Updates blog.

     “Philadelphia is a good city in which to write American history.“

     -Franklin D. Roosevelt

   Happy Constitution Day! Today’s the day when we celebrate the signing
   of the U.S. Constitution in Philadelphia on September 17, 1787!

   The Constitution acted like a colossal merger, uniting a group of
   states with different interests, laws, and cultures. Under America’s
   first national  government, the Articles of Confederation, the states
   acted together only for specific purposes. The Constitution united its
   citizens as members of a whole, vesting the power of the union in the
   people. Without it, the American Experiment might have ended as quickly
   as it had begun.

   The National Archives is home to the Constitution, as well as the
   Declaration of Independence, and the Bill of Rights. Today is a great
   day to brush up on your Charters of Freedom history, or to learn
   something new about America’s founding documents. Head over to
   Archives.gov for Constitution Day!

   Happy Mandela Day!

   Today, July 18, marks the international celebration and 100th birthday
   of Nelson Mandela. This day of service was created in 2009 by the
   United States along with 192 United Nations member states to
   commemorate the life and legacy of the former president of South Africa
   and Nobel Peace Prize recipient.

   In 2011, First Lady Michelle Obama met Nelson Mandela at his home
   during an official visit to South Africa and later shared her
   experience with a group of attendees at the Young African Women’s
   Leaders Forum in Soweto, South Africa.

   Previously unseen home movie footage of FDR’s adapted walk

   Franklin D. Roosevelt was paralyzed by polio at the age of 39. He
   devised a method of “walking” where he used a cane and the arm of a
   companion for balance. During his Presidency, the press was told not to
   film his disability. The FDR Presidential Library recently received
   footage of the 1935 White House Easter Egg Roll from a family in
   Nevada. Historian Geoffrey C. Ward believes it’s “the most vivid
   glimpse we’ve yet had” of FDR’s adapted walk. Find out the story behind
   the rare film.

     The Pare Lorentz Film Center at the Franklin D. Roosevelt
     Presidential Library and Museum has launched a new animated video on
     Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Dust Bowl created by Roosevelt
     great-granddaughter and visual storyteller Perrin Ireland and
     narrated by CBS News correspondent Bill Whitaker. The project was
     funded by a grant from the New York Community Trust.

      “FDR and the Dust Bowl” combines powerful animated visuals with
     stirring narrative to stimulate viewer engagement with important
     aspects of the Roosevelt story. This is the second video released as
     part of the Pare Lorentz Film Center’s “Animate the Roosevelts”
     project. The first video – focusing on Japanese American Interment –
     was released in 2017.

   On this day, June 18, 1979, President Jimmy Carter and General
   Secretary Leonid Brezhnev signed the SALT II strategic arms limitation
   treaty between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. in Vienna.

   The SALT II Treaty established clear rules and limits on nuclear
   weapons. Although SALT II did not end the arms race, the treaty and its
   protocol:
     * Limited the number of strategic nuclear delivery systems (bombers
       and missile launchers) after January 1, 1981.
     * Restricted the number of warheads that could be put on each ICBM
       and SLBM.
     * Banned the deployment of mobile ICBMs or the flight testing of
       ICBMs from mobile launchers.
     * Limited the range of land or sea-based cruise missiles, and
     * Banned the testing or deployment of Air to Surface Ballistic
       Missiles.

   Though the Treaty had been signed, it still had to be ratified by a 2/3
   majority in the Senate. On June 22, the SALT II Treaty was submitted by
   the President to the Senate for debate. The Senate Foreign Relations
   Committee approved ratification of the Treaty, but the USSR invaded
   Afghanistan before it could be voted on by the full Senate.

   In January 1980, President Carter asked the Senate to delay
   ratification until the US responded to the invasion. Although the
   treaty was never ratified, both sides agreed to honor its terms until
   it would have expired December 31, 1985.

     “What is important in our lives is not so much what we have in the
     way of intelligence or talent, but what we do with these gifts.”

     Betty Ford shared these words of wisdom with the newest graduates of
     Grand Rapids’ Central High School at their commencement ceremony on
     June 7, 1976. Her remarks touched upon her experiences since she
     herself had graduated from Central 40 years earlier. "You begin with
     your own hopes and talents and what happens is not always what you
     plan,” she told the Class of 1976, “but if you follow your heart and
     discipline yourself to be the very best you can, I believe you will
     find many rewards.“

     Read Betty Ford’s full remarks at Central High School Commencement.
