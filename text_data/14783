   A Pastel Baby

Summer Came Early

   February 9, 2019February 11, 2019 by Alyssa Garrison
   [raop-logo.png]

   When I thought about writing this post, I always imagined the pride I’d
   feel sharing my beautiful home birth. No fear or panic, just essential
   oils, fairy lights and all of the women I respect and admire most
   crowded around a birthing tub in my living room. Together, with all the
   girl power we could […]

Showered with Love and Pink Tea

   November 12, 2018November 13, 2018 by Alyssa Garrison
   [raop-logo.png]

   When talks of planning my baby shower started to surface I knew two
   things – I didn’t want to be too involved, and I didn’t want anything
   too typical. I’m a total control freak with a set vision for just about
   everything in my life, so letting go of the reigns on this one was […]

Q+A About My Pastel Baby On The Way!

   August 10, 2018November 13, 2018 by Alyssa Garrison
   [raop-logo.png]

   WHAT. A. WHIRLWIND. In all honesty I had a whole other blog post
   written to share today, but as the week unfolded since my announcement
   Monday I decided something more raw and less bubbly-blogger was needed.
   Yes, of COURSE I’m so excited, and this is everything I’ve ever dreamed
   of coming to fruition, but there’s […]

#HeaveninHighPark Reveal

   [raop-logo.png]

   And just like that, it’s finally here. I feel like I’ve been living in
   #Heaveninhighpark for years and years, but the truth is I worked pretty
   hard to have it ready for a reveal this quickly. I knew the only person
   who could truly bring the space to life was Scarlet Oneill and with her
   […]

Summer Skin

   This post is sponsored by AVEENO® Canada. All opinions are my own!
   Despite her namesake, Summer was born in the dead of Canadian winter –
   in fact, her birth seemed to set off a whole series of snowstorms! I’m
   a summer baby myself, and since I’m originally from Vancouver I never
   really dealt with below […]

Caring is Cute

   August 12, 2019August 6, 2019 by Alyssa Garrison
   [raop-logo.png]

   Here at RAOP, we love all things colourful and cute, but we also care
   about the environment/world/greater good. Just a couple of weeks ago we
   passed “Earth Overshoot Day”, which means that humanity has used up
   more resources than the earth can regenerate this year (you can read
   more about it here). Basically we’re using […]

A Bee-autiful Day with The Heritage Bee Co.

   August 9, 2019August 6, 2019 by Alyssa Garrison
   [raop-logo.png]

   I have always loved honey. Growing up my Great Grandmother would always
   put a heaping spoonful into my cup of earl grey tea, and then she’d
   sneak a spoonful right into my mouth too if my mom wasn’t looking.
   Smiling at her as the honey melted on my tongue will forever remain one
   of my […]

Summer’s Favourite COLOURFUL Baby Brands

   August 5, 2019August 6, 2019 by Alyssa Garrison
   [raop-logo.png]

   Dressing a baby is one of those super cute fun things that every parent
   I know looks forward to, but once you’re in the thick of it there’s a
   lot more complexity than one would expect! Fit, comfort, laundering and
   ease of changing diapers are all important factors to consider, and a
   lot of these […]

Milk Making Magic + Oat Milk Recipe!

   August 2, 2019August 2, 2019 by Alyssa Garrison
   [raop-logo.png]

   First off, happy World Breastfeeding Week everyone! I have so many
   mixed feelings about breastfeeding, something I did not expect when
   expecting. My mom had a horrible time trying with me and my sister, a
   painful anxiety-filled experience that left her riddled with guilt,
   disappointment, and in the end, no milk. Her milk supply never […]

   Hello! I'm Alyssa, a professional dreamer with ever-changing pastel
   hair. Surviving on a diet of mainly sugar, I delight in sparkly
   surprises and rarely remove my rose-tinted glasses. So come, gallop
   through the glitter with me.
