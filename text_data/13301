Our Story

   Shake Shack sprouted from a hot dog cart in Madison Square Park in
   Manhattan to support the Madison Square Park Conservancy’s first art
   installation. The cart was quite the success, with Shack fans lined up
   daily for three summers.

   In 2004, a permanent kiosk opened in the park: Shake Shack was born.
   This modern day “roadside” burger stand serves up the most delicious
   burgers, hot dogs, frozen custard, shakes, beer, wine and more. An
   instant neighborhood fixture, Shake Shack welcomed people from all over
   the city, country and world who gathered together to enjoy fresh,
   simple, high-quality versions of the classics in a majestic setting.
   The rest, as they say, is burger history.

Stand for something good

   We are the world! We love our planet and all its inhabitants. We’re

Good Ingredients
       100% all-natural Angus beef, vegetarian fed, humanely raised and
       source verified. No hormones or antibiotics – EVER. We pride
       ourselves on sourcing incredible ingredients from like-minded
       artisanal producers.
     *

Good 'n' Green
       Every Shack recycles all bottles and plastics, whether you sort or
       we do the sorting post-collection. It’s the most efficient way to
       make sure ZERO recyclable material ends up in landfills. Our
       cooking oil is reused to produce clean energy and our kitchen food
       is composted where locally possible.
     *

Good Bones
       Each Shack is constructed thoughtfully and purposefully to fit its
       unique environment, using a creative design approach that
       creates places and experiences like nowhere else. All good in the
       wood!

Good Neighbors
       We’re all about our hood! We strive to be the best employers and
       citizens of each community we call home. Whether partnering with
       Share Our Strength or working with local charitable organizations
       to donate 5% of sales of a specific concrete – the Shack is
       committed to giving back.
