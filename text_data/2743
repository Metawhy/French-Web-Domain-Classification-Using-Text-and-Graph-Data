   Updated Navigation Paths: I've re-organized prints by author and book
   so some inlinks will give an error or take you to the main artist page
   for awhile. Not all prints are back, but are on their way. The new site
   is mobile-friendly and the shopping cart is easier to use. Major artist
   updates are in the Site Map. Detailed print information is on the main
   artist page (Parrish, Dulac, and Bauer so far).
     * For images only, all but a very few images are up in the Art
       Passions albums.
     * For art prints, the easiest way is to follow the artist link in the
       Catalog of Artists. You can also use the search function to locate
       an artist/book combination. It won't take you to a particular
       image, however, because it only searches titles and headings.

   Unconquerable, Arthur Rackham illustration for Prince Albert's Book.
   The image shown, Unconquerable, was Arthur Rackham's contribution to
   King Albert�s Book. As king, Albert refused to allow German troops safe
   passage through Belgium to pre-emptively attack France, who the Germans
   believed would enter Belgium en route to attacking Germany in support
   of Russia. The German invasion brought Britain into the war as one of
   the guarantors of Belgian neutrality under the Treaty of 1839. King
   Albert, as prescribed by the Belgian constitution, took personal
   command of the Belgian army, and staved off Germany long enough for
   Britain and France to prepare for the Battle of the Marne September
   1914.

About the Golden Age

   One consequence of the Pre-Raphaelite movement in general, spurred by
   William Morris's fascination with the printed word in particular, was
   popularity in the 1880s and going forward of what we call, retrospect,
   the Golden Age of Illustration. Advances in technology made available
   higher quality reproductions and the public came to value these. Gift
   books, often with fairy tale and adventure themes, were themselves
   works of art, with gilded edges and cover art became popular gifts for
   children and other adults.

   World War I heralded an end to the Golden Age but even in its swan
   song, elaborate gift books were created in support of the war effort:
   Arthur Rackham's Allies Fairy Book, Edmund Dulac's Picture Book for the
   Red Cross, Princess Mary's Gift Book, and King Albert's Book.

Recent News

   Dulac, Parrish, Bauer, Nielsen are back. Working on Dore.

   Coming: Duncan Carse, Rie Cramer, Edward Detmold. Some new additions to
   Rackham and others.

   The site should now be mobile friendly. There is a new shopping cart
   that should work. If not, please use the contact link. The Search now
   works, but does not search the entirety of every page, just the titles.
   As the individual pages come back, every print will be available
   through search.

   About Us: Artsy Craftsy is the business side of Art Passions; they look
   more like each other as time goes on. At Artsy Craftsy you can buy art
   prints for many of the artists at you find Art Passions. Not every Art
   Passions image is available as an art print here -- some are just too
   far gone. Artsy Craftsy fine art prints fall in a wide circle of mythic
   and fairy tale themes around artists I like, focusing on Golden Age
   illustrators and Preraphaelite artists. Sometimes, though, another
   artist wins my heart and I can't resist.

   Some things here you won't find anywhere else, but you don't find what
   you want, especially if it was here before the site update, ask and
   I'll try to help. Art Passions prints are 100% cotton rag fine art
   paper with archival inks and ship within a day or two.
