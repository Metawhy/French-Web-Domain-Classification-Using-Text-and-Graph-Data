Enterprise Cybersecurity: Making Risk Management a Priority

   October 16, 2017Richard Spires4 min read

   Since October is Cybersecurity Awareness Month, I thought it
   appropriate to comment on developments in the field and implications
   for workforce training and awareness.

   With the seemingly endless array of cybersecurity products, tools and
   related “best practices” available that promise to protect an
   organization’s enterprise and its data, it is fascinating to see the
   continued spate of successful cyberattacks. Whether it be one-off
   attacks against large companies and government organizations, like the
   recent Equifax and SEC breaches, or large-scale campaigns based on a
   software vulnerability, such as the recent WannaCry and Petya
   ransomware attacks, it appears that the adversaries are winning – and
   winning at an increasing rate. How is it, in an era of ever more
   sophisticated cybersecurity tools, that it feels like we are
   backsliding?


   How is it, in an era of ever more sophisticated cybersecurity tools,
   that it feels like we are backsliding? Twitter Icon

   For those of us who have in senior IT roles in large enterprises, it’s
   well-understood that there are three factors that, when combined, make
   it exceptionally difficult to secure an environment and prevent
   successful cyberattacks:

   1. Complexity

   In almost all large organizations, you can find tremendous complexity
   in the IT environment: a combination of legacy (likely antiquated)
   systems that are still core to business operations, many modern
   applications that are likely built in a number of different languages
   and architectures, and a new set of applications that are running in a
   public cloud. In particular, SaaS-based applications are becoming the
   way organizations quickly and easily leverage new applications.

   Not so long ago, IT security staff worked to protect the organization’s
   IT perimeter. With today’s new computing and service models, we have to
   admit that a traditional perimeter no longer exists – or, if a
   perimeter does exist, it might include protecting a number (perhaps up
   to dozens) of third-party cloud service and SaaS-application providers.

   2. Adversaries

   The second factor working against our ability to protect our
   environments and data are the adversaries themselves. Through new ways
   to share techniques and data, they are ever more sophisticated and
   persistent. Whether they’re nation-states or criminal organizations,
   there is tremendous gain potential for the adversaries, and the
   investment needed is relatively modest.

   3. Talent

   The third factor making cybersecurity defense so difficult is the lack
   of available talent. Again, estimates vary, but Cisco estimates that
   there are currently one million unfilled cybersecurity jobs worldwide.
   Most large organizations struggle to find, develop and retain such
   talent.

   In large organizations, the sheer complexity of the IT ecosystem
   requires both proper management of that environment (e.g., rigorous
   software patching) and proper implementation and monitoring of tools to
   support the organization’s cybersecurity posture. Such tools include
   identity management and access control systems, firewalls, intrusion
   detection systems, etc. It is difficult to find and retain the talent
   necessary to implement and monitor such systems. No wonder so many
   organizations are struggling (more than they will admit publicly) to
   properly manage and secure their IT systems.

   While I believe we are, as an industry, still losing ground to our
   adversaries, there are some positive developments. The awareness of
   cybersecurity risk among CEOs, board members and government leaders has
   increased significantly over the past few years, and many organizations
   recognize that cybersecurity breaches are the greatest business risk
   they face. Organizations are becoming more sophisticated in treating
   this challenge as an enterprise risk management problem and using tools
   to help them identify a rational way forward to address that risk. As
   daunting as the challenge can be, organizations are facing the fact
   that they must triage the problem and focus on the protections to
   minimize the risk that can do the organization the most harm.

   To this end, I want to showcase two tools that are being adopted as de
   facto standards for supporting organizations in their cybersecurity
   enterprise risk management efforts.

   The first tool is the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, which was developed
   as an action in an executive order issued by President Barack Obama to
   address cybersecurity risks to the critical infrastructure sector. The
   NIST framework outlines a rigorous seven-step process that results in
   an action plan to implement the investments that will have the greatest
   positive impact for an organization’s cybersecurity posture. NIST
   personnel did not develop the framework in a vacuum; it was
   crowdsourced with the support of more than 3,000 people from diverse
   parts of industry, academia and government.

   It’s already proving valuable; according to Gartner, by 2020, more than
   50 percent of U.S.-based organizations will use the NIST Cybersecurity
   Framework, up from 30 percent in 2015. Recently, President Donald Trump
   issued a cybersecurity executive order directing all agencies to adopt
   and use the framework to address their enterprise risk management
   posture.

   The second tool that can support organizations in their cybersecurity
   risk management efforts (and work in concert with the NIST framework)
   is the Center for Internet Security’s (CIS) 20 critical control suite
   (CCS). These controls are recommended actions that provide specific and
   actionable ways to stop today’s most pervasive and dangerous
   cyberattacks.

   For organizations of all sizes, I recommend that those charged to
   protect your IT systems and data become familiar with the NIST
   Cybersecurity Framework and the CIS 20 CCS. Training programs,
   certifications and even some master’s degree programs are beginning to
   emerge that build on the NIST Framework. However, we must remember that
   the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and CIS 20 CCS are tools, not
   solutions in and of themselves. They can provide an organization with
   the roadmap to conduct rigorous and regular cybersecurity enterprise
   risk management processes that will significantly lower its risk to
   catastrophic loss. The implementation of a robust cybersecurity
   enterprise risk management process, however, will always be dependent
   on an organization’s leaders’ sustained commitment to implementing and
   overseeing the process.
