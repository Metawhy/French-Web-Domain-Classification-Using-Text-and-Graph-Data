The Dig

   The Shmunis Family Excavations at Kiriath-jearim is a joint project of
   Tel Aviv University and the Collège de France, funded by Sana and Vlad
   Shmunis (USA). Israel Finkelstein of Tel Aviv University and Thomas
   Römer and Christophe Nicolle of the Collège de France direct the
   project. The staff of the expedition includes French, Israeli and
   American archaeologists. The first season of excavation took place in
   the summer of 2017 (see preliminary report) the second season is
   scheduled for August 2019.

The Site

   Kiriath-Jearim is located in a commanding spot in the Judean highlands,
   12 km west of Jerusalem. The Arabic name – Deir el-Azar – probably
   stems from the reference to Eleazar, who according to 1 Samuel 7: 1
   took charge of the ark of the covenant when it was brought to
   Kiriath-Jearim. The identification of Deir el-Azar with biblical
   Kiriath-Jearim is accepted unanimously. The mound is ca. 250 x 250 m in
   size = 5 hectares, one of the biggest Iron Age tells in the highlands.
   It has not been damaged by modern construction.

   The site is mentioned many times in the Bible: as a border town between
   the territories of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, in the Ark
   Narrative, the list of returnees from exile and other places. According
   to the Book of Samuel the ark had been captured by the Philistines
   following the defeat of Israel in the battle of Eben-ezer. It then
   spread havoc in Philistines cities and was hence returned to
   Beth-shemesh. From there it was taken to Kiriath-Jearim and finally
   brought by King David to Jerusalem.

   The Ark Narrative and the strong polemic against the town in the Bible
   hint at the existence of a temple in late-monarchic times.

The Monastery of the Ark of the Covenant

   The Monastery is situated at the summit of the site. Remains of a
   Byzantine church, probably commemorating the tradition of the ark, were
   uncovered here in the beginning of the 20th century. They can be seen
   in the modern church of Notre Dame.
