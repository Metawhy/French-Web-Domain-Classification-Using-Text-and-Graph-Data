PROTECTING RAINFOREST WITH COOL EARTH IS AN ESSENTIAL CLIMATE ACTION.

   a regular donation.

   Regular giving not only protects rainforest month after month, it helps
   Cool Earth plan ahead, making long term improvements that change
   peoples lives.

   Give Regularly

   conservation activities, building on environmental knowledge of their
   forest and climate change.

A baby anteater in the Awajún

   Our Awajún partners have a new friend.

   This baby anteater was orphaned so the village of Kayants took him
   under their wing.

   Watch a video of him enjoying a tasty snack of termites:
