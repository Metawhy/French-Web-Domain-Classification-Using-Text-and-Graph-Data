   11th RECOMB - Comparative Genomics 2013

   To register, please do not attempt to create an account, go directly to
   the registration page (now closed).


   The RECOMB Comparative Genomics annual meeting
   gathers worldwide scientists with reknowned experience in the
   comparison of genomics and other genome related data. Enhancement of
   the qualitative and quantitative technology offers an ever increasing
   pace in the amount of data generated on an everyday basis. This
   requires a strong demand in theorical and/or empirical research in the
   field of comparative genomics.

   We will be happy to meet and listen to invited speakers and those with
   accepted contributed talks in mathematical, computational and/or
   biology, in particular those with computational approaches that
   contribute to major steps forward in genome comparisons.

   We will welcome contributions in any fields related to this non
   exhaustive list will refer to
     * algorithms in genome rearrangement,
     * comparative tools for genome assembly,
     * gene identification and/or annotation,
     * comparison of functional networks,
     * genomic variation,
     * comparative epigenomics,
     * genome evolution,
     * paleogenomics,
     * cancer evolutionary genomics.

   Any other research topics not listed here and relevant to comparative
   genomics will also be considered with a strong interest likewise.

   In a first step, we will welcome paper submissions and accepted
   articles will be published in the open access international online
   journal BMC Bioinformatics. BMC will charge publication fees
   independently from the conference registration. In a second step,
   poster submission will be considered.

   The meeting will be held on the campus of the University Claude-Bernard
   Lyon1 (UCBL1) and National Institute of Applied Sciences (INSA) in
   Villeurbanne, in the immediate vicinity of the city of Lyon, France.


   The meeting is organized by INRIA, national computer science research
   institute in France, with the help of the LBBE, Biometry and
   Evolutionary Biology Lab in Lyon
