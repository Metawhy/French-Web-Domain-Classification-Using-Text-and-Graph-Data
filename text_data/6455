About Us

   Sentebale is a charity founded by The Duke of Sussex and Prince Seeiso
   in 2006 following Prince Harry’s gap year to Lesotho in 2004.

   We help the most vulnerable children in Lesotho, Botswana and Malawi
   get the support they need to lead healthy and productive lives.
   Sentebale works with local grassroots organisations to help these
   children – the victims of extreme poverty and the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
   Together, we’re making a big difference to these children’s lives. We
   can do even more with your help.

Our Vision

   To work in partnership to transform positively the lives of the world’s
   most vulnerable children.

Our Mission

   To become the leading organisation in the provision of psychosocial
   support for children living with HIV in Southern Africa.

Patrons – The Duke of Sussex

   “In 2004 I was 19 and went travelling in my gap year. I had a fantastic
   time in Australia, Argentina and Botswana but in the end the thing that
   had the greatest impact on me was the two months I spent working in
   Lesotho.

   I was lucky enough to have an amazing guide in Prince Seeiso. His
   knowledge and compassion for his country showed me that there could be
   a way of making a difference in Lesotho that would go far beyond the
   building projects I worked on.

   I met so many children whose lives had been shattered following the
   death of their parents – they were so vulnerable and in need of care
   and attention.

   Again and again as we travelled round Lesotho we saw the same thing:
   great work being done in the community by amazing volunteers who
   weren’t able to attract support, because they didn’t have professional
   managers or accountants to show where the money was going.

   To highlight the issues facing Lesotho, we arranged to make a
   documentary called “The Forgotten Kingdom”. Prince Seeiso and I decided
   that we could make a long-term difference by starting a charity that
   could direct funds to the grassroots organisations, which were taking
   so much of the strain but finding it hard to get help.

   We came up with the name Sentebale, which means “forget-me-not” in
   Sesotho, the language of Lesotho, and the idea seemed perfect.

   This charity is a way in which Prince Seeiso and I can remember our
   mothers, who both worked with vulnerable children and people affected
   by AIDS. I really feel that by doing this I can follow in my mother’s
   footsteps and keep her legacy alive.

   In 2007 we opened our office in Lesotho so that we can work directly
   with grassroots organisations to transform the lives of children and
   young people.”

Patrons – Prince Seeiso

   “As I grew up in Lesotho’s capital, Maseru, my late father was very
   conscious that my brother and I should, as much as possible, experience
   life in Lesotho just as our contemporaries did. Most children in
   Lesotho live in small villages or rural areas. My father did not want
   us to believe that we were any different from those children. Almost
   every school holiday he sent us out of town to Matsieng, our ancestral
   home.

   In the hills I would go on horseback to my father’s cattle-post,
   tending his cattle, sheep, goats and horses. Sometimes I would live and
   work alongside the Basotho young men whose job it was to look after
   herds for weeks on end. Nevertheless it was not an entirely typical
   experience. The conditions at our cattle-posts are far better than
   many, and my father was very sensitive not to employ under-aged
   persons.

   About a third of Lesotho’s young men are sent away by their parents
   every year to be herd boys – but often they are not young men at all,
   but boys as young as 10 years old.

   It is the harsh socio-economic reality of life in Lesotho that forces
   families to send their sons away to work like this. They are sent to
   the remotest hill country where they endure extremely bleak conditions,
   living in primitive huts on their own. Unlike me, they aren’t able to
   go to school. The herd boy tradition denies them any opportunity to
   enjoy their youth and curtails their prospects of overcoming the cycle
   of poverty they are trapped in.

   I took Prince Harry to stay overnight in the mountains at one of our
   cattle-posts. From this mountain cattle-post the dream of Sentebale was
   born: to give the less privileged and often forgotten vulnerable
   children a chance of some schooling – and thus a ray of hope for a
   better future.

   I know this will not be easy, nor will it happen overnight. We are
   committed for the very long term. Lesotho is a small, impoverished
   country. Its problems have been made infinitely worse since I grew up
   because of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. It has been said that we, as a
   nation, are facing annihilation. With this real possibility facing us I
   want to establish Sentebale as a vehicle that takes on the plight of
   the many marginalized vulnerable children of Lesotho. This must include
   not only children affected or infected by HIV/AIDS, but also the
   disabled, the traumatized and the abused, and especially the herd boys.

   I hope this endeavour is, in some non-presumptuous way, honouring the
   efforts of my late Mother, and saying not only to Basotho people, but
   to all humanity, that we should not let ourselves forget who she was,
   what she did and achieved amongst her people. The mission is still to
   embark on that journey and continue the good fight.”
