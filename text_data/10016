Thursday Thoughts - Vol 32

   Happy Thursday! Last Wednesday I was little under the weather so I
   didn't manage to get my Thursday Thoughts put together, but I'm back
   this week!
   [FullSizeRender%2B%25281%2529.jpg]
    1. I've got puppy fever. It's bad. It's been so warm in Kansas City
       the last week, and there are people out with their dogs everywhere.
       I get so envious, but then I remember how much work puppies can be,
       and how much I love quick weekend trips. Evie's fine for a few days
       on her own, but a puppy? Not so much. Who has a dog they want to
       loan me occasionally? :)
    2. Tootsie rolls are a really underrated candy. I would never think to
       buy them myself, but we have a big bowl of them in the reception
       area at work, and I might have had [DEL: one :DEL] four yesterday
       afternoon, and they were delicious...but not the fruit flavored
       ones. Those are gross. Chocolate only.
    3. I really wish Starbucks drinks were more consistent. Gosh I sound
       like such a bratty, white girl. #firstworldproblems ...but really.
       Last week I ordered a skinny hazelnut latte, and it was disgusting.
       So gross in fact, that I ended up pouring half of it down the
       drain, but yesterday, yesterday I ordered the exact same thing, and
       it was the most delicious latte ever. What a tough life I have.
    4. Speaking of tough, last Wednesday I had a halo laser treatment in
       an attempt to get rid of some acne scaring, and good golly that
       thing was painful. They give you a numbing cream prior to the
       treatment, but there's nothing quite like the smell of burning
       skin. Not to mention I looked like a chipmunk for the next two days
       because my face was so swollen. Cory kept telling me I looked like
       a Bratz doll. He's so kind like that. I'll spare you any pictures.
       I'm still peeling pretty bad right now, but I think it helped so
       fingers crossed my scars are gone!
    5. Do you guys have one position you HAVE to sleep in? Last week after
       my treatment I was instructed to sleep elevated on my back to
       prevent swelling, and it was awful. I cannot sleep on my back. I
       have a Fitbit that tracks sleep, and it said I was restless 37
       times. THIRTY SEVEN how is that even possible!?! Oh ya. I was awake
       the entire night. I sleep on my stomach or not at all apparently.
       Lord help me if I'm ever pregnant. That will be the longest 9
       months of my life.
    6. I'm getting ready to list my house for sale so Cory and I spent
       Sunday cleaning out my basement (thanks Cory!). We took FOUR car
       loads of crap to Goodwill, and I still have half a car full of more
       crap to donate still. I think I was well on my way to becoming a
       hoarder. At least I wasn't hoarding cats? Have you all seen those
       people on TV? So disturbing..
    7. This list of 50 Of The Happiest Feelings To Remember On a Bad
       Day is kinda perfect. Happy Thursday Friends!

Mint Chocolate Chip Cupcakes

   In honor of National Chocolate Mint Day, I thought it would be
   appropriate to share these Mint Chocolate Chip Cupcakes. While making
   these won't be quite as easy as plowing through a sleeve of Thin Mints,
   I promise they are equally (if not more) satisfying and way prettier.
   [IMG_3430.JPG]
   When I made these I was in a bit of a time crunch so I started with a
   box of Pillsbury Moist Supreme Chocolate cake mix, and just added a
   teaspoon of mint extract to give them a little extra pizazz. Did the
   word pizazz make anyone else thing of pizza? I typed that, and then
   immediately started thinking about how much I wanted to have pizza for
   dinner tonight. I'm such a fat kid at heart. Anyways, let's get back on
   topic. Bake as instructed on the cake box in a lined cupcake pan. Set
   aside, and let cool completely.
   [IMG_3406.JPG]
   Now it's time for the fun part - the mint chocolate buttercream
   frosting. Here is what you'll need:
   Mint Buttercream Frosting
     * 3 cups powdered sugar, sifted
     * 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
     * 1/8 teaspoon salt
     * 1 teaspoon mint extract
     * 6-8 drops green food coloring
     * 1 cup semisweet chocolate chunks

   In a mixing bowl, beat together the sifted powdered sugar, butter, and
   salt until smooth. This should only take about 2-3 minutes. Scrape down
   the sides of the bowl and add the mint extract and food coloring. Mix
   for another 2-3 minutes until light and fluffy. Stir in the chocolate
   chunks by hand to avoid breaking them in the mixer.
   [IMG_3978.JPG]
   Using a large ice cream scoop, scoop some frosting onto the top of each
   cupcake. It's that simple! Now it's time to enjoy! Happy National
   Chocolate Mint Day y'all!

weekend recap

   Monday's are tough. Monday's after a three day weekend are even
   tougher. Monday's after a three day weekend in my favorite city ever
   are the toughest of all.
   Cory and I spent a long weekend in Charleston getting some wedding
   planning done. In all actuality we were done with the "planning" by
   noon on Friday, but we'll use any excuse for a trip to Charleston. We
   did apply for our marriage license, and we met our officiant for the
   first time (he's wonderful). Other than that, we're leaving the details
   in the hands of our also wonderful, very-capable wedding planner. I
   seriously don't know what I would do without her. She's amazing.
   The rest of the weekend was spent exploring, eating, happy houring,
   eating, eating some more, attending SEWE, and celebrating Valentine's
   Day. I'm so lucky to have found the best travel partner, and partner in
   general. We have so much fun together, and he's pretty darn cute too.
   Okay. Done being mushy. The number of new restaurants opening in
   Charleston constantly is insane, and each one is just as delicious as
   the next. So not good for my wedding diet, but so worth it. Anyways,
   rather than bore you with what we ate where, I'll let the pictures do
   the talking.

                                             [IMG_1129.JPG]
    After applying for our marriage license at the Courthouse, we met our
                                   wedding
              planner at our wedding venue, the Gadsden House.

                               [IMG_1073.JPG]
            I mean, these chandeliers are insane. Love love love!

                               [IMG_9359.JPG]
         Avocado toast at my favorite brunch/lunch spot - Park Cafe.

                                             [IMG_9368.JPG]
   Followed by coconut cake at a bakery I've walked by half a dozen times,
            but had yet to try, Carmella's Cafe and Dessert Bar.

                            [FullSizeRender%2B%252812%2529.jpg]
     Happy hour drinks (my first drink since NYE mind you) at The Watch
                          Rooftop Kitchen & Spirits

                    [FullSizeRender%2B%252813%2529.jpg]
            Happy hour stop #2 for $5 Moscow Mules at The Rarebit

                             [FullSizeRender%2B%252814%2529.jpg]
    Pizza (from Desano's) and prosecco in our hotel room to round out day
                               #1. Perfection!

                     [FullSizeRender%2B%252815%2529.jpg]
                   Acai bowls for breakfast from Huriyali.

                                             [IMG_9426.JPG]
   Doing some cardio (and starfish hunting) at Isle of Palms before we met
                           up with some Charleston
     Jayhawks at Moe's Crosstown to watch the KU-Oklahoma game. What. a.
                      game. Rock Chalk! Also, I didn't
    snap any pictures at Moe's but it's a great little neighborhood dive
                  bar with delicious (and cheap) bar food.

                                           [IMG_9428.JPG]
       I made a new rule during the game - if KU wins then we must eat
                    dessert. Hence the brambleberry crisp
   waffle cone from Jeni's. Best ice cream ever! Saturday night Cory and I
                    had dinner at a great little Italian
   restaurant, Wild Olive, on John's Island. The food and atmosphere were
                      great. I was too busy stuffing my
            face to document it, but I highly suggest trying it!

                            [FullSizeRender%2B%252816%2529.jpg]
     Of course we had to cap off the night with some more ice cream - a
                       strawberry shortcake ice cream
                    sandwich from Peace Pies to be exact.

                                 [IMG_9439%2B%25281%2529.JPG]
     This was my favorite thing I ate all weekend - pear toast from the
             Daily. If I'm being totally honest, I ate it twice.
    We went there on Saturday morning, and then I begged Cory to take me
                back on Sunday because it was just that good.

                                  [IMG_9456%2B%25281%2529.JPG]
    You guys. I wanted to adopt this little pup at SEWE so bad. Isn't he
               precious? Sadly I came back to KC empty handed.

                                  [IMG_9463%2B%25281%2529.JPG]
    Cory and I rounded out our feasting with a trip to Minero for a late
                brunch/lunch. I'm always game for a margarita
     and some chips and guac so this hit the spot. The chef, Sean Brock,
                     owns a few other restaurants around
                   Charleston, all of which are delicious.

                            [FullSizeRender%2B%252818%2529.jpg]
     Cory and I rounded out the weekend watching the Dock Dog finals at
     SEWE. Those poor little guys jumped their little hearts out in the
    freezing weather. I felt so bad for them jumping into that water, but
                    they didn't seem to mind too much :)

   If you're ever planning a trip to Charleston, be sure to let me know
   and I will happily give you a laundry list of suggestions!

Thursday Thoughts - Vol 31

   Happy Thursday! I have the day off work tomorrow so today is
   technically my Friday which I couldn't be happier about! Let's get to
   Thursday Thoughts!
   [IMG_9259.JPG]
    1. Ever since my first Whole 30 last year, I've been obsessed with
       putting avocado in my smoothies. Have you all tried it?!? It makes
       it so creamy, delicious, and dessert-like. Obviously it isn't as
       good as a real milkshake, but still good none the less....and now
       I'm craving a milkshake. There's this fast food restaurant in the
       South called Cook Out. Midwesterners probably aren't familiar, but
       if you ever find yourself nearby one, order a peach cobbler
       milkshake. You will not be disappointed.
    2. Was anyone else super disappointed there wasn't a cute Budweiser
       Clydesdale and/or dalmatian commercial during the Super Bowl?!?
       It's my favorite commercial every. single. year. I mean I guess
       it's a good thing they're trying to advocate against drunk driving,
       but give me the heart wrenching, lifelong friendship between a
       Clydesdale and his trainer that still makes me tear up any day.
       Seriously if that commercial doesn't make you cry just a little I
       don't think you have a heart.
    3. Speaking of animals and crying, does anyone else full on sob when
       an animal dies in a movie but barely shed a tear when a human dies?
       Does this make me a bad person? Probably.

                              [FullSizeRender%2B%252811%2529.jpg]
   Animals over people any day! ...I'm not sure Evie appreciates my
   sentiment.
    4. I didn't celebrate National Pizza Day this week, and I'm still
       regretting it so there's that.
    5. Is anyone giving up something for Lent? I'm not even Catholic, but
       I usually try to think of something to go without until Easter, but
       this year I'm at a loss. Any ideas?
    6. I'm so excited for this I can hardly stand it. An 8th Harry Potter
       installment?!? Best. Summer. Ever.
