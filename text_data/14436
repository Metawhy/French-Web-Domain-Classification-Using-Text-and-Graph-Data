   Addition of Certain Entities to the Entity List and Revision of Entries
   on the Entity List,
   effective August 19,
   2019


   Effective August 19, 2019, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (Huawei) and
   sixty-eight of its non-U.S. affiliates were added to the Entity List
   effective May 16, 2019.  Their addition to the Entity List imposed a
   licensing requirement under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR)
   regarding the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of any item
   subject to the EAR to any of these sixty-nine listed Huawei entities.
   The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is now adding forty-six
   additional non-U.S. affiliates of Huawei to the Entity List because
   they also pose a significant risk of involvement in activities contrary
   to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United
   States.  Nineteen of these forty-six affiliated entities are being
   added to the existing entry for Huawei; the other twenty-seven entities
   are being added under new, separate entries.  This rule also modifies
   the existing entries for Huawei and three Huawei affiliates in China by
   moving the three affiliates under the entry for Huawei instead of
   continuing to list them under separate entries, and by adding one alias
   and four addresses to the Huawei entry, including the addresses for
   those three affiliates.  The entries for five other existing entries
   for Huawei affiliates in China, Belgium, and Brazil are also being
   modified by this rule.

   8/21/19
   84 FR 43487
   Temporary General License: Extension of Validity, Clarifications to
   Authorized Transactions, and Changes to Certification Statement
   Requirements,
   effective August
   19,2019


   Effective August 19, 2019, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)
   amended the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to revise a
   temporary general license.  On May 16, 2019, Huawei Technologies Co.,
   Ltd. (Huawei) and sixty-eight of its non-U.S. affiliates were added to
   the Entity List. Their addition to the Entity List imposed a licensing
   requirement under the EAR regarding the export, reexport, or transfer
   (in-country) of any item subject to the EAR to any of these 69 listed
   Huawei entities. The Entity List-based licensing requirement applied in
   addition to any other license requirement, if any, applicable under the
   EAR to the transaction in question. On May 22, 2019, BIS published a
   temporary general license, effective May 20, 2019, that modified the
   effect of the listing in order to temporarily authorize engagement in
   certain transactions, involving the export, reexport, or transfer
   (in-country) of items subject to the EAR to the 69 listed Huawei
   entities. The U.S. Government has decided to extend the temporary
   general license through November 18, 2019. In order to implement this
   decision, this final rule revises the temporary general license to
   remove the expiration date of August 19, 2019, and substitutes the date
   of November 18, 2019. This final rule also makes certain clarifying
   changes to the authorized transactions under the temporary general
   license to improve public understanding. Lastly, this final rule
   revises the temporary general license by changing which party to the
   transaction is required to create the certification statement by
   requiring that the exporter, reexporter, or transferor obtain a
   certification statement from the pertinent Huawei listed entity prior
   to using the temporary general license. Concurrently with the this
   final rule, BIS is also publishing elsewhere in the August 21 issue of
   the Federal Register and effective August 19, 2019 the final rule,
   Addition of Certain Entities to the Entity List and Revision of Entries
   on the Entity List. This final rule, as a conforming change for the
   addition of these other non-U.S. affiliates of Huawei to the Entity
   List, revises the temporary general license to include those additional
   Huawei affiliates within the scope of the temporary general
   license.

   Addition of Certain Entities to the Entity List, Revision of Entries on
   the Entity List, and Removal of Entities from the Entity List

   In this rule, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) amends the
   Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by adding seventeen entities,
   under a total of nineteen entries, to the Entity List. These seventeen
   entities have been determined by the U.S. Government to be acting
   contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the
   United States. These entities will be listed on the Entity List under
   the destinations of Armenia, Belgium, Canada, the People’s Republic of
   China (China), Georgia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Russia,
   the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.), and the United Kingdom (U.K.). This
   rule also modifies a total of twenty-three entries on the Entity List
   under the destinations of China, Hong Kong, and Russia. Finally, this
   rule removes a total of three entities under the destinations of China
   and the U.A.E. The removals are made in connection with requests for
   removal that BIS received pursuant to the EAR and a review of
   information provided in those requests.

   Revisions to the Unverified List(UVL)


   The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is amending the Export
   Administration Regulations (EAR) by removing eight (8) persons from the
   Unverified List (“UVL”) and correcting the name for one (1) person
   currently listed on the UVL.  The eight persons are removed from the
   UVL on the basis that BIS was able to verify their bona fides because
   of an end-use check.

   Addition of Entities to the Entity List and Revision of an Entry on the
   Entity List


   In this rule, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) amends the
   Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by adding five entities to the
   Entity List.  These five entities have been determined by the U.S.
   Government to be acting contrary to the national security or foreign
   policy interests of the United States.  These entities will be listed
   on the Entity List under the destination of China.  This rule also
   modifies one entry on the Entity List under the destination of China.

   Restricting the Temporary Sojourn of Aircraft and Vessels to Cuba



   Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE

   In this final rule, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) further
   limits the types of aircraft that are authorized to fly to Cuba and the
   types of vessels that are authorized to sail to Cuba on temporary
   sojourn.  Specifically, this rule amends License Exception Aircraft,
   Vessels and Spacecraft (AVS) in the Export Administration Regulations
   (EAR) to remove the authorization for the export or reexport to Cuba of
   most non-commercial aircraft and passenger and recreational vessels on
   temporary sojourn.  Additionally, this rule amends the licensing policy
   for exports and reexports to Cuba of aircraft and vessels on temporary
   sojourn to establish a general policy of denial absent a foreign policy
   or national security interest as determined by the U.S. Government.
   Consequently, private and corporate aircraft, cruise ships, sailboats,
   fishing boats, and other similar aircraft and vessels generally will be
   prohibited from going to Cuba.  BIS is making these amendments to
   support the Administration’s national security and foreign policy
   decision to restrict non-family travel to Cuba to prevent U.S. funds
   from enriching the Cuban regime, which continues to repress the Cuban
   people and provides ongoing support to the Maduro regime in Venezuela.
   These amendments are consistent with the National Security Presidential
   Memorandum on Strengthening the Policy of the United States Toward
   Cuba. Signed by the President on June 16, 2017.

   Revisions to Country Group Designations for Venezuela and Conforming
   Changes for License Requirements

   In this final rule, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) amends
   the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to remove Venezuela from
   Country Group B, which affords favorable treatment for certain exports
   of National Security-controlled items, and moves Venezuela to Country
   Group D:1, which lists countries of national security concern. This
   final rule makes these changes to the EAR to reflect current national
   security concerns related to Venezuela, e.g., the introduction of
   foreign military personnel and equipment into Venezuela, and to better
   protect U.S. national security. The changes in this final rule also
   better align the Country Group designations for Venezuela with other
   EAR national security-related provisions that already apply to
   Venezuela, e.g., the military end-use and end-user controls that apply
   to certain items for export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) and
   provisions that are specific to countries subject to U.S. arms
   embargoes. In addition, this final rule adds Venezuela to Country
   Groups D:2-4, which list countries of nuclear, chemical and biological
   weapons, and missile technology concern, respectively.

   Implementation of Certain New Controls on Emerging Technologies Agreed
   at Wassenaar Arrangement 2018 Plenary
   The Bureau of Industry and Security maintains, as part of its Export
   Administration Regulations, the Commerce Control List (CCL), which
   identifies certain items subject to Department of Commerce’s
   jurisdiction. This final rule revises the CCL to implement certain
   changes made to the Wassenaar Arrangement List of Dual-Use Goods and
   Technologies maintained and agreed to by governments participating in
   the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and
   Dual-Use Goods and Technologies (Wassenaar Arrangement, or WA) at the
   December 2018 WA Plenary meeting. The Wassenaar Arrangement advocates
   implementation of effective export controls on strategic items with the
   objective of improving regional and international security and
   stability. This rule harmonizes the CCL with only the agreements on
   recently developed or developing technologies not previously controlled
   that are essential to the national security of the United States and
   warrant early implementation. The remaining agreements will be
   implemented in a separate rule. This rule revises (4) ECCNs 3A001,
   5A002, 6A001 and 9A004; and adds ECCN 3D005.

   Addition of Entities to the Entity List (final rule), effective May 16,
   2019

   Effective May 16, 2019, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)
   amended the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by adding Huawei
   Technologies Co., Ltd. (Huawei) to the Entity List. The U.S. Government
   has determined that there is reasonable cause to believe that Huawei
   has been involved in activities contrary to the national security or
   foreign policy interests of the United States. BIS is also adding
   non-U.S. affiliates of Huawei to the Entity List because those
   affiliates pose a significant risk of involvement in activities
   contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the
   United States. Huawei will be listed on the Entity List under the
   destination of China. This final rule also adds to the Entity List
   sixty-eight non-U.S. affiliates of Huawei located in twenty-six
   destinations: Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Canada, Chile, China,
   Egypt, Germany, Hong Kong, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Lebanon, Madagascar,
   Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Paraguay, Qatar, Singapore, Sri Lanka,
   Switzerland, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and Vietnam.

   Addition of Certain Entities to the Entity List, Revision of an Entry
   on the Entity List, and Removal of an Entity from the Entity List

   This final rule amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by
   adding twelve entities, under a total of sixteen entries, to the Entity
   List. These twelve entities have been determined by the U.S. Government
   to be acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy
   interests of the United States and will be listed on the Entity List
   under the destinations of China, Hong Kong, Pakistan and the United
   Arab Emirates. This rule also modifies one existing entry on the Entity
   List under the destination of the United Arab Emirates. Finally, this
   rule removes one entity under the destination of the United Arab
   Emirates. The removal is made in connection with a request for removal
   that BIS received pursuant to sections of the EAR used for requesting
   removal or modification of an Entity List entry and a review of
   information provided in that request.

   Revisions to the Unverified List (UVL)

   This final rule adds fifty (50) persons to the UVL by amending
   Supplement No. 6 to Part 744 of the Export Administration Regulation
   (EAR) to include their names and addresses.  The fifty persons are
   added to the UVL on the basis that BIS could not verify their bona
   fides because an end-use check could not be completed satisfactorily
   for reasons outside the U.S. Government’s control. The new entries
   consist of thirty-seven persons located in China, six in Hong Kong,
   four in the United Arab Emirates, two in Malaysia, and one in
   Indonesia.  This rule also adds one additional address for one person
   currently listed on the UVL, Ling Ao Electronic Technology Co. Ltd,
   a.k.a. Voyage Technology (HK) Co., Ltd., a.k.a. Xuan Qi Technology Co.
   Ltd., as BIS has determined that this person is receiving exports from
   the United States at an additional address.

   Request for Public Comments Regarding Review of Commerce Control List
   for Items Transferred from United States Munitions List Categories IV
   and XV

   As part of its work with the National Space Council, the Bureau of
   Industry and Security, Department of Commerce requests public comment
   to inform its review of the controls implemented in recent revisions to
   Categories IV and XV of the United States Munitions List (USML) and the
   related transfer of items to the Department of Commerce’s Commerce
   Control List (CCL).  These items include launch vehicles, guided
   missiles, ballistic missiles, rockets, torpedoes, bombs, and mines; and
   spacecraft and related articles.  BIS’s review seeks to ensure that the
   CCL describes these items clearly, captures those items in normal
   commercial use, accounts for technological developments, and implements
   the national security and foreign policy objectives of the United
   States properly.  Comments must be received by BIS no later than April
   22, 2019.
