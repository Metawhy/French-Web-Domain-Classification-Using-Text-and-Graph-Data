Cookies Notice

   Last updated: September 19, 2019

   At Bose, we respect your concerns about privacy and value the
   relationship that we have with you. This Cookies Notice (the “Notice”)
   explains how Bose Corporation and its affiliates use cookies and other
   similar technology to recognize you when you visit our websites that
   link to this Notice (the “Site”). It explains what these technologies
   are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of
   them.
     * If you live in the United States, Latin America, or Canada, Bose
       Corporation (located at The Mountain, Framingham, MA 01701) is the
       data controller for your information. If you live in China, Bose
       Electronics (Shanghai) Company Limited (located at Part C, Plant 9,
       No. 353 North Riying, China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone) is
       the data controller for your information.
     * If you live anywhere else, Bose Products B.V. (located at Gorslaan
       60, Purmerend, The Netherlands) is the data controller with the
       exception of processing activities in relation to product support,
       product analysis, and development activities for which Bose
       Corporation is the data controller.

   For the purposes of this Notice, we refer to these entities
   collectively as “Bose.”

   This Notice explains:
     * What are cookies?
     * Types of information collected and reasons for collection
     * Types of cookies we use
     * Duration of storage of cookies on your device

What are cookies?

   Cookies are text files that are downloaded to your computer or mobile
   device when you visit a website and store certain information about
   Site usage. They are useful because they allow websites to recognize a
   user's device. They are then returned to the original website on each
   subsequent visit or to any other website that recognizes them. For more
   information on cookies, go to www.allaboutcookies.org.

   The term “cookie” is used in this Notice in the broad sense to include
   all similar techniques and technology, including web beacons and log
   files. For more information on these additional tools, see our
   “Glossary” section below.

Types of information collected and reasons for collection

   Cookies help us to better understand your use of our Site and, as a
   result, allow us, among other things, to offer our web visitors a more
   personalized and consistent experience. Here are examples of the types
   of information that we collect through cookies:
     * The number of users visiting the Bose Site, the frequency with
       which the Site was viewed, the pages viewed, the clicks made on the
       Site and the total duration of navigation on the Site;
     * The name of the website visited prior to the Bose Site;
     * Whether you are visiting our Site for the first time or not;
     * Your viewing preferences (e.g. layout, sizing preferences,
       language, etc.);
     * Your purchases and your orders;
     * Your user name, your password, the type of browser used and your IP
       address, so that we can identify you during your next visits.

   Note that we do not collect your name or email address through cookies.

   In addition, cookies allow us to do the following:
     * Customize your visit: We may use information collected during your
       visit to facilitate your next visit to our Site
     * Customize the advertising and marketing messages that appear on the
       Site, whether ours or those of third parties. This involves, for
       example, identifying the features of our Site that interest you,
       recommending accessories for your Bose system or displaying helpful
       information such as how to extend your audio system to your
       computer or other parts of your home. Our goal is to fulfill your
       wishes as quickly and easily as possible
     * Analyze customer trends: We compile information on our Site visits
       and analyze them as a whole in aggregated form. This type of study
       aims to identify trends among many visitors to our Site, rather
       than analyze the information of a particular visitor

Type of cookies we use

   We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some
   cookies are necessary for technical reasons for our Site to operate
   and/or provide basic functionality to you, and we refer to these as
   “essential” cookies. Other cookies enable us to track and target the
   interests of our users and to enhance the experience on our Site. Third
   parties also serve cookies through our Site for advertising, analytics
   and other purposes. The specific types of first- and third-party
   cookies served through our Site and the purposes they perform are
   described in more detail below.

   First-party cookies

   These cookies are created by Bose. They are, for the most part, used to
   allow you to browse our Site and use its features. They may also assist
   in analytics activities.

   Third-party cookies

   In addition to our proprietary cookies, some third-party and affiliated
   companies may place cookies on your computer, access them and associate
   web beacons with them. These cookies enable third-party features or
   functionalities to be provided on or through the Site. The parties that
   set these third-party cookies can recognize your device both when it
   visits our Site and also when it visits certain other websites.

   The types of first- and third-party cookies we use on the Site are:
     * Essential website cookies: These cookies are strictly necessary to
       provide you with services available through our Site and to use
       some of its features, such as access to secure areas that require
       registration. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to
       deliver the Site to you, you cannot refuse them without impacting
       Site functionality
     * Functional cookies: These cookies allow you to browse our Site or
       benefit from some of its features, such as memorizing language
       preferences, placing orders online or using instant messaging
       support. Similar to essential cookies, if these cookies are
       disabled, it could impact your experience to use some site
       functionality, such as your set preferences
     * Analytics cookies: These cookies allow us or our third-party
       analytics providers to collect statistics (aggregated and
       anonymous) on the use of the Site by you and other visitors. Thanks
       to this information, Bose is able to improve the features offered
       on its Site
     * Online behavioral advertising cookies: These cookies, provided by
       our third-party advertising partners, collect several types of data
       about your browsing habits, as well as your preferences for
       products and services. This information allows Bose and our
       third-party advertising providers to display relevant
       advertisements on the Site and other sites you visit

   To refuse these various types of cookies, please follow the
   instructions below under the section “Cookie management."

Duration of storage of cookies on your device

   The duration of storage of cookies on your device may vary, depending
   on the category to which they belong: temporary or permanent.

   Temporary cookies

   We use temporary cookies on all our secure pages to assign and register
   a session ID. You can browse our entire Site without interruption. This
   identifier is also used for internal reporting purposes. It does not
   allow us to identify you by name and this type of cookie does not leave
   any information recoverable on your hard drive. Most of our proprietary
   cookies fall into this category and expire when you close your Internet
   browser.

   Permanent cookies

   Our proprietary analysis cookies and third-party cookies are permanent
   cookies. They allow us to understand visitors’ browsing behavior over a
   longer period of time or to provide you with additional features
   related to your Site customization requests and the content that you
   have saved or stored. They can stay on your computer for 24 hours, a
   week or several years, depending on their function. This means that
   these cookies survive after your browser is closed and can be used by
   our Site to recognize your computer when you reopen your browser later.

Cookie management

   We only place cookies on your device after you give us permission. If
   you want to refuse cookies, please follow the instructions below.

   Additionally, for European bose.com domains, you have the option to
   adjust what cookies you allow us to place on your browser through our
   Cookie Preference Center. You can modify these settings at any time.
   Please note for clarity, that the Cookie Preference Center does not
   manage websites for Bose Automotive. For these sites, you should follow
   instructions for managing cookies via your browser (below).

   All cookies: You can exercise your preference to receive all types of
   cookies by managing cookies from your web browser. As the means by
   which to activate or deactivate cookies varies from one web browser to
   another, you should visit your web browser’s help menu for more
   information on cookie preferences. You can also configure your browser
   at any time to be notified of the receipt of a cookie, so that you can
   decide whether you want to accept it or not. Cookies do not under any
   circumstances read the data from your hard drive and you can delete
   them from your computer at any time. At the moment, it is technically
   impossible for you to synchronize your settings between your browsers
   and your devices (your computer or your smartphone). You must set them
   on each browser/device that you currently use and each time you use a
   new browser or device. Please note that if you choose to disable or
   deactivate cookies, this will apply to all cookies and have the
   consequences on Site functionality discussed in the section
   “Consequences of deactivation of all cookies” below.

   Analytics cookies: To disable analytics cookies managed by our
   third-party analytics partners, either use the browser disablement
   mechanisms discussed immediately above, or use the analytics opt-out
   mechanisms maintained by our analytics providers:
   Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on
   Adobe
   Mixpanel
   Flurry
   BazaarVoice

   Online advertising cookies: If you are interested in more information
   about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control
   cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored
   advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s
   Consumer Opt-Out link, the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer
   Opt-Out link, or Your Online Choices to opt-out of receiving tailored
   advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt
   out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google
   display network ads, visit the Google Ads Settings page. You can also
   opt out of specific ad networks with which we partner by visiting the
   following links:
   Google Ad Settings
   Adobe

   These cookies, defined by Bose or by advertising partners, collect
   several types of data about your browsing habits, as well as your
   preferences for products and services. This information allows Bose and
   its partners to post relevant advertisements on their respective
   websites.

Consequences of deactivation of all cookies

   If you choose to deactivate cookies, you may continue to use certain
   parts of our Site. However, some useful features may not work anymore,
   depending on which cookies you deactivate. For example, you will not be
   able to use online chat to ask technical questions or make purchases,
   and the Site and its content may not be as relevant to your
   preferences. You will not be able to search for resellers through our
   tool or share pages with your social network.

   Please note that if you have disabled one or more cookies, we may
   continue to use the information that was collected by such cookies
   before they were deactivated. However, we will cease to collect any
   information via the opted-out cookie once a cookie has been
   deactivated.

Changes to the Cookies Notice

   This Notice may be revised occasionally. Any changes made will be
   reflected on this Site. Please revisit this Cookies Notice regularly to
   stay informed about our use of cookies. If you have any questions,
   please contact us as explained below.

   If you have questions about the use of cookies on our Site, do not
   hesitate to contact us by email at: privacyandsecurity@bose.com. You

   we collect about you and how you may exercise your data privacy rights

   Rated 5 out of 5 by SlyDi from Love Love Love My son bought these for
   me for mother's day. Shocker. I love them, but at the gym I was needing
   to be creative when laying down doing bench presses etc., the
   creativity has come to an end. I bought some small sticky velcro
   circles, and put 4 at the top of the headband, both sides of 1 circle x
   2, and it works perfectly. It does stick to my hair, but I can fix it
   when I take the headphones off. I'm so excited to put it to the real
   test today.

   Rated 5 out of 5 by blitzen from Bought these several years ago! I
   bought these several years ago and are still going strong. Noise
   cancellation is excellent and better than any other brand of headphones
   I have bought and tried and wasted my money on (except noise canceling
   shooting muffs). I use these while operating noisy farm equipment so I
   can also listen to e-books and podcasts, exercising, working at the
   office, gaming and while the jets are running in the spa so I can watch
   movies on an ipad while soaking. I prefer over-the-ear headphones since
   in spite of different bud sizing offered by different brands, I haven't
   found any that fit properly in my smaller ears and that won't fall out
   EXCEPT for Apple ear buds which fit perfectly. The only problem is that
   Apple's earbuds aren't noise-canceling. (To be fair, I haven't tried
   Bose's in-ear buds.) Considering how I abuse these with frequent
   outdoor use, they are incredibly durable and water resistant. That
   being said, these are NOT good for target shooting -- I still use noise
   canceling shooting muffs designed for that purpose. DON'T FORGET TO
   UPDATE YOUR DEVICE. I only just realized I haven't been doing it. I
   have now turned on the "notifications" feature in the app which will
   let me know about device updates. I didn't do it before since I don't
   want a bunch of garbage marketing notifications, so if I find a lot of
   those coming through I'll turn it off again. The only bad thing about
   coming to the Bose website is that I now want to buy the latest and
   greatest model with AR!

FAQ

   What is the difference between QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones and
          QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones II?
          QuietComfort 35 headphones II offer the same unmatched
          combination of acclaimed noise reduction technology, wireless
          freedom, audio performance, dual-microphone system and 20-hour
          battery life as QuietComfort 35 headphones. However,
          QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones II also have a new Action
          button on the left earcup. In countries and languages where
          voice assistants, like Amazon Alexa or the Google Assistant, are
          available, the Action button gives you instant access to voice
          controlled tasks. In countries where voice assistants are not
          available, it lets you quickly toggle through three different
          ANR settings for optimal performance wherever you go.

   Do I have access to both Amazon Alexa and the Google Assistant?
          Yes. QuietComfort 35 headphones II are optimized for both Amazon
          Alexa and the Google Assistant, so you can choose which is right
          for you. If you purchased QuietComfort 35 headphones II prior to
          July 2018, the Alexa functionality is available through a simple
          over-the-air update on the Bose Connect app.

   How do I know if my QC35 headphones II are Bose AR-enabled?
          Bose has updated the Bose Connect app — for Apple iOS users only
          to start — to help you easily identify if your QC35 II has the
          Bose AR technology built in. A Bose AR logo will be displayed in
          the app whenever it detects a Bose AR product is paired. Please
          note, you will need Bose Connect version 8.0 or later and that
          some products may require a software update prior to
          experiencing this new feature.

   What is TriPort acoustic headphone structure?
          Proprietary TriPort acoustic headphone structure utilizes
          external ports to vent the earcups and effectively enlarge the
          acoustic volume, without increasing the size of the earcup. The
          result is better audio and active noise reduction from a
          smaller, lighter, more comfortable headphone. TriPort acoustic
          headphone structure is used in all our consumer headphones and
          headsets.

   How is the total noise cancellation in QuietComfort 35 wireless
          headphones II achieved?
          QuietComfort 35 headphones II utilize both active and passive
          noise reduction technologies. They use a sophisticated
          proprietary electronics approach to active noise reduction,
          placing microphones both inside and outside the earcups. The
          electronics system senses the sound in almost any environment
          and then measures, compares and reacts—instant by instant—to
          produce an opposing cancellation signal. The passive noise
          reduction is achieved by the combination of the acoustic design
          and materials chosen for the earcups and cushions.

   What is NFC?
          Near Field Communication (NFC) is a short-range wireless
          technology that enables two NFC-enabled devices to communicate
          when they are placed in close proximity, typically less than 4
          in (10 cm). For QuietComfort 35 headphones II, NFC is used to
          facilitate Bluetooth pairing. When an NFC-enabled device, such
          as a smartphone, is placed near the right earcup of the
          headphones, it pairs them to the device via Bluetooth. Placing
          the device near the earcup a second time will unpair the
          headphones.

   Can QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones II take calls?
          Yes. QuietComfort 35 headphones II have a dual-microphone system
          to allow you to use them during calls when connected to a
          smartphone that supports the Bluetooth® HFP profile. In addition
          to traditional calls, the headphones will work with many apps
          that use Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), such as Skype or
          FaceTime. The dual-mic system helps reduce wind and background
          noise to ensure an exceptional far-end experience, while
          sidetone lets you hear your own voice so you sound natural when
          speaking on a call. QuietComfort 35 headphones II also support
          HD Voice.

   How do I pair QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones II with my mobile
          device?
          For NFC-enabled phones, simply turn on the headphones by sliding
          the three-position power switch to the middle position and then
          tap the back side of your phone on the front of the right earcup
          where you see the embossed NFC logo, and follow the prompt to
          accept a connection. If you don’t have an NFC-enabled phone,
          first, make sure the headphones are turned on by sliding the
          three-position power switch to the middle position. Next, press
          the three-position power switch to the Bluetooth icon until the
          Bluetooth LED flashes blue or the voice-enhanced user interface
          gives you additional directions. Now, follow the directions
          within the smartphone’s Bluetooth menu to connect the
          headphones. Once the connection is made, the Bluetooth LED will
          turn white.

   Can QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones II simultaneously be connected
          to two mobile devices?
          Yes. Multi-point technology allows QC35 headphones II to
          maintain a connection to two devices at the same time—for
          example, an iPad and a smartphone. So while you’re watching
          video on the connected iPad, the headphones will automatically
          pause the video to answer a call from the connected smartphone.
          When the call is finished, the headphones switch back to the
          video on the iPad.

   What is the range of QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones II?
          QuietComfort 35 headphones II have a range of 30 feet (9 meters)
          from the source device. It is realistic to describe the range as
          being the room the user is in and the adjacent room. This range
          may be reduced by physical obstructions, such as walls and
          doors, or by interference from other electronic devices. Pops or
          a crackling noise may be heard if there’s interference with the
          Bluetooth® connection. If that happens, move away from wireless
          routers or microwaves and bring your headphones closer to the
          Bluetooth device.

   How do I charge QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones II?
          QuietComfort 35 headphones II can be charged using the USB cable
          supplied in the box and plugging it into a USB port on a
          computer or a wall charger (sold separately). Allow up to 2.25
          hours for the headphones to fully charge. Once they are fully
          charged, the battery indicator light will turn green. When you
          don’t have time for a full charge, the fast-charge feature
          provides up to 2.5 hours of play time from a quick, 15-minute
          charge.

   How long will the battery stay charged?
          QuietComfort 35 headphones II use a lithium-ion rechargeable
          battery that stays powered for up to 20 hours while using the
          headphones wirelessly and up to 40 hours for wired use.

   Can you listen to music when the battery runs down?
          Yes. These headphones allow users to continue to listen to their
          source even if the battery power is depleted. Without power,
          neither active noise cancellation nor Active EQ is able to
          function.

   Can I charge QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones II from my PC/laptop?
          Yes. QuietComfort 35 headphones II come with a USB cable that
          allows the headphones to be charged from your PC or laptop.
          Please note that the PC or laptop must be on and awake in order
          to charge over USB.

   What are the buttons for on the back of the right earcup?
          The larger middle button is the multi-function button. It
          initiates play/pause and other track controls for videos and
          music, answers and ends calls, and can also initiate voice
          commands such as Siri or voice dial. The buttons on either side
          of the multi-function button are volume +/- buttons. They allow
          you to easily adjust volume in an intuitive up/down vertical
          orientation.
