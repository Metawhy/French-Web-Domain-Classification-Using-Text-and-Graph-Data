Complete category coverage

   With over 17,000 supported brands, Fit Finder is the only sizing
   solution with complete coverage of men, women, and children across all
   categories of apparel and footwear.
   [icon-best-02.svg]

Unparalleled performance

   In a series of live A/B tests with the world's biggest brands, Fit
   Finder is proven to consistently outperform both static size charts and
   all rival solutions.
   [icon-best-03.svg]

Advanced fit prediction

   Fit Finder employs advanced machine learning algorithms and the apparel
   industry's largest dataset to deliver sizing recommendations that are
   grounded in science rather than subjectivity.
   [icon-best-04.svg]

Superior ux

   We've combined extensive usability lab testing with years of iterative
   improvement to create a friction-free user journey that's perfectly
   optimized across all devices.

How it works

Social Sizing

   Using advanced machine learning, Fit Finder matches shoppers against
   their fit doubles to deliver unbeatably accurate, data-driven sizing
   recommendations that are easily understood by end users.

This is Nina:

   5' 8" / 135 lbs / 32 years old

   prefers a slightly loose fit

This is Sara:

   5' 8" / 132 lbs / 34 years old

   prefers a slightly loose fit
   Returned it
   Kept it

   These two people are the same woman. OK, not really. But they share the
   same ‘fit profile': similar height, weight, age, and body shape; even
   the same preference for slightly loose-fitting clothes. We can use
   Sara's purchase history to recommend a size for Nina.

   Nina enters her height, weight and age, and identifies her body
   shape...

   Nina gets a recommendation for the size purchased by shoppers similar
   to her - shoppers like Sara, who bought this same shirt in size M and
   did not return it for size.

   It's 30 days later. Did Nina keep the shirt, or return it for a
   different size? Either way, our algorithm learns from the customer
   feedback and uses Nina's experience to recommend the best possible size
   the next time around.

3 Steps to Sizing Success

   Our integration process is designed around three key stages that ensure
   consistent results for years to come while completely removing the need
   for additional upfront work by your team.
   1

Import Product Feeds

   We start with an extensive health check of your existing product feeds.
   Our team of integration experts quickly identifies any potential issues
   and works closely with you to fix them where necessary before importing
   to our platform.
   [productfeed.png]
   2

Platform Integration

   Our frontend team then takes care of integrating Fit Finder on your
   site via your existing tag manager or a custom integration script -
   your IT team doesn't have to write a single line of code in either
   case.
   [codesnippet.png]
   3

Bulletproof Pre-Launch QA

   Finally, we perform a series of rigorous QA tests so you can be
   confident your existing e-commerce setup will continue to work
   flawlessly when Fit Finder goes live on your site.

Full support

All Shop Systems and Tag Managers

   PDP and checkout integration is handled by us either via your existing
   tag manager or a simple two-line integration script which we prepare.
   All major shop systems and tag managers are fully supported and you
   don't need to free up any additional time or resources along the way –
   it's quick, it's easy, and it just works.

Where We Began

   Uncertainty around fit is the single biggest source of friction on the
   online path to purchase. Not only does it cripple conversions, it also
   leads to sky-high return rates that damage the environment and the
   bottom line. With roots in Germany (where the average return rate for
   online retail firms can be a staggering 50-60%), we've been deeply
   familiar with the scale of the online sizing problem since our
   inception.

   Our initial solution centered around a webcam-based body modeling
   service which let users create a personalized fit profile. The
   technology itself was strong, but it was a big ask getting shoppers to
   embrace it. In many ways, we were facing the same issue as stores
   themselves – asking customers to solve the sizing problem rather than
   doing it for them.
   Our webcam solution circa 2010

   This realization quickly led to the creation of our flagship Fit Finder
   product and the underlying Fit Analytics data platform. With more and
   more of the world's leading brands and retailers partnering with us,
   the power of our platform continues to grow as we build out the next
   generation of innovative machine-learning solutions.

   With the unveiling of our revised product suite in early 2018, Fit
   Analytics now offers a comprehensive set of data-driven solutions that
   will power growth across all areas of your apparel business for many
   years to come. From Manufacturing to Marketing, the four core elements
   of our product suite put machine learning at the heart of your apparel

   aspects of your business.
