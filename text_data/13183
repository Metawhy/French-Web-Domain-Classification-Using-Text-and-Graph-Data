About the game

   GRID is a racing experience like no other.

   Offering unrivalled moment-to-moment racing, GRID returns with an
   all-new experience where every race is the chance to choose your own
   path, create your own story and conquer the world of motorsport.

   Take your place in the GRID World Series and fight in thrilling
   wheel-to-wheel battles with the most iconic and desirable race cars –
   current and classic, from GT through Touring and Muscle to Stock and
   Super Modifieds – and in some of the world’s most iconic locations.
   GRID captures every moment of the race, from the adrenaline rush of
   lights-out to the elation at the chequered flag – and in-between, it’s
   all action too. Incidents come one right after the other – tight
   overtakes, bumper-to bumper scrapes and competitive collisions – all
   heightened by rivalries, team-mates and a nemesis driver who will all
   either try to help or hinder your progress.
