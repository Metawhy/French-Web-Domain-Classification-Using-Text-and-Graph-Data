   FAQ

Is Bitvise affiliated with PuTTY?

   Bitvise is not affiliated with PuTTY. We develop our SSH Server for
   Windows, which is compatible with PuTTY. Many PuTTY users are therefore
   our users as well. From time to time, they need to find the PuTTY
   download link.

   We also provide an SSH Client for Windows which is not a version of
   PuTTY, but is free and dedicatedly maintained. Many PuTTY users like
   our SSH Client as well.

How did Bitvise acquire this domain?

   Bitvise was not the original registrant of putty.org. We purchased it
   from a previous owner who used it in ways unrelated to software. We
   thought it useful to repurpose it the way you see.
