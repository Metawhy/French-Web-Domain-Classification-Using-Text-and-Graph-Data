Creative Halloween Ideas for ELA

   The countdown to Halloween is on! If you're looking for some fun, new
   and creative ideas for your classroom this October, then you have come
   to the right place! I'm sharing several Halloween-themed ideas that can
   be used during the month of October, the weeks leading up to the
   holiday, as well as some quick and easy ideas that you can add to your
   classroom on October 31st.
   [00000001D.png]
   [0001.png]
   If you're looking for a SPOOKY way to entice some creative writing in
   your class, consider using 5-word horror stories. Not only are they a
   ton of fun, but they are also a really quick way to bring some
   holiday-themed creativity to your classroom. You can give your students
   words or themes to base their stories on (depending on the time
   available) and incorporate as many or as little as you would like.
   For example, you could give your students some random Halloween words
   (bat, witch, skeleton, etc.) to base their stories on or a theme, such
   as school.
     * We have a test now. (Scary for students!)
     * You have hours of homework. (Also, scary for students!)

   [0001.png]
   [00000001A3.png] Another fun way to incorporate some daily writing
   practice into your class is through the use of these Halloween
   Bell-Ringers. This print-and-go (editable) bulletin board display is a
   win-win. It's not only a great way to get your students thinking
   critically about the prompts, but it also serves as festive classroom
   decor. 😀
   There are 31 prompts included, but you can use as many or as little as
   you would like. To reveal the prompt, simply flip up or remove the
   cover. I let my students pick the prompts, which gives it the
   interactive vibe as opposed to just writing them on the board. You can
   use one prompt a day until the end of October or reveal a few prompts
   each day during the last few weeks before Halloween.
   Here are a few examples of the prompts you will find in:

     * Tell the story from the perspective of a Halloween trick-or-treat
       bag or one of the candies within the bag. What do you see? How do
       you feel? This story can be based around the days leading up to
       Halloween, the night of, or the days following.
     * Finish the story: "Everyone said the old Miller house was haunted,
       but I had to see for myself. I called my friends and we made our
       way down Crickety Street..."

   [0001.png]
   The month of October is a great way to incorporate scary short stories
   into your lessons. There are tons of well-known short stories that you
   have probably already heard of (The Monkey's Paw, The Legend of Sleepy
   Hollow, The Tell-Tale Heart, etc.), but what about some other great
   stories that may be less known?
     * If Cornered, Scream by Patricia Thurmond (I show this YouTube video
       after we read it)
     * Candle Cove by Kris Straub
     * Our Neighbor's House by Emily Carroll
     * Redcap by Carrie Vaughn

   [0001.png]
    If you are looking for a few ways to keep your students entertained
   during the last few days (or week) leading up to Halloween, try an
   escape room! I created six Halloween-themed challenges in the escape
   room I called, "The Great Halloween Escape!" Students will complete a
   variety of tasks using different skills: problem solving, critical
   thinking, reading and basic math. Math in English? It's a fun way to
   get those students involved (who may be stronger in math as opposed to
   English) in a peer setting. Click HERE to check out my Halloween Escape
   Room.
   [0000001a.png]
   [0001.png]
   What better way to add some spooktacular fun into your classroom than
   by telling some ghost stories. Whether you share some with your
   students, your students write their own or you find some short clips on
   YouTube to show, it's a perfect way to set the scene for Halloween.
   Here are a few tips for telling the perfect ghost story:
   1. Turn off the lights.
   2. Hold a flashlight to your face (you know, how you see in the
   movies!)
   3. Tell the story as if it just happened.
   Note: You might even want to have your students use a flashlight to
   read their ghost stories all at once with the lights off (if you happen
   to have some in print) and cell phone flashlights are a great way to do
   so.
   [0001.png]
   While most of us have big plans to complete Halloween activities over a
   few days, if we are being realistic, we often are often left to having
   only a small part of our class to dedicate to those types of
   activities. For this reason, I created this FREE Halloween Grammar
   Worksheet.
   This grammar activity challenges a student to think critically by
   selecting the best word that would not otherwise fit into a sentence.
   In other words, instead of selecting the correct word to use in the
   sentence, students have to be a bit more careful in their selection by
   choosing the incorrect term.
   [00000001A3.png]
   I get so many questions on WHY I would try to confuse my students when
   they are already having a hard time. Now, I wouldn't give this activity
   to a younger student who is truly having a tough time as it is.
   However, by high school, students should (and I use that term loosely)
   have a decent grasp on these words. If you give this to your students
   and they still have a hard time with it, then perhaps this activity
   would be a great lead into a mini-grammar lesson. Grammar takes years
   to master. It should be reviewed often, but in my experience, it is
   not.

Six Tips for Teaching Journalism

   Tips for teaching journalism
   By Tracee Orman
   Teaching journalism is so important in today's climate, yet so many
   teachers are thrown into it without preparation or guidance. Even
   though teaching journalism was the reason I wanted to teach (I was
   actually a journalist before I became a teacher), I still found it to
   be incredibly challenging. Whether you are a newbie or a seasoned
   veteran, I hope my tips will help make your job easier.
   [JournalismPost1.png]
   [JournalismPostAccuracy.png] While I was in college, I was fortunate
   enough to have one of the best writers in our area as my professor.
   Professor Julie Jensen McDonald was one of the toughest writing
   teachers I ever had. The first thing she asked our Newswriting class
   was, "What are the three most important words in journalism?" After
   answering numerous wrong answers, she replied loudly, "ACCURACY,
   ACCURACY, ACCURACY!" Without accuracy, she explained, there is no
   story. This was back in the early 90s, before the age of "fake news."
   It's just as--and even more--important now to teach this to students. I
   always hung a sign in our writing lab with those three words on it to
   remind students to always strive for 100% accuracy.
   Some of the ways you can instill this in students include:
   • Provide a list of all students and staff and require students to
   triple-check the spellings of all names.
   • Require students to use primary sources for information.
   • Require students to triple-check facts and figures.
   • Require students to verify quotes from their sources.
   [JournalismPost2.png]
   [JournalismPostQuestions.png] The best textbook you can provide your
   students is the newspaper. It always amazes me how many students begin
   journalism class without ever reading a newspaper. Through the
   wonderful Newspapers in Education program, schools can get online
   access to digital editions and some newspapers will still offer print
   editions of their paper to schools, free of charge. Ask your librarian
   if your school has an online or print subscription.
   When you have access to the paper, read stories together with your
   class. I would read aloud the lead of the big news stories and ask
   students to name the who, what, when, where, why, and how of each story
   (we had to go deeper into the story, normally, to answer the last two).
   The more your students practice identifying these essential elements of
   a news story, the more proficient they will become when writing their
   own.
   To practice news writing, I offer a step-by-step presentation and
   tutorial with handouts and activities for students. It's a great way to
   train students for this writing style.
   [JournalismPostNewswriting.png]
   [JournalismPost3.png]
   I would argue that a customized handbook is quite possibly the most
   valuable tool in any journalism class. It will save you time (and your
   sanity), will promote consistency in writing, and will teach students
   to find answers to their questions themselves.
   Handbooks should include things such as the proper way to write the
   date, time, and titles as well as whether the publication should use
   "says" or "said" in attributions. It will also give instructions on
   which fonts (and sizes) to use and where and how to save work.
   If it seems like a daunting task to come up with your own handbook from
   scratch, I can help you out! You can download a ready-made handbook
   that is completely editable using InDesign (and it also includes a PDF
   version).
   [JournalismPost4.png]
   Get into the habit of having regular staff meetings. If you produce a
   school newspaper every-other-week, have a staff meeting the day after
   publication. If you have writing assignments due every month, have a
   staff meeting at the very least once a month. It's important to address
   any problems before they become bad habits and equally important to
   praise students' efforts. Staff meetings are also a great time to get
   organized and assign duties for each deadline period.
   Begin your staff meetings with positive reinforcement by having
   students share what they liked about the last issue of the paper or the
   last batch of stories the class wrote. (If you don't have an outlet for
   sharing student work, start now! Even if it's just on a private or
   school website, it's important for students to read one another's
   work.) Have a student write all the positives on the board so students
   can see what worked well and repeat the formula for the next issue or
   round of writing.
   When discussing what needs improvement, try to remain positive and not
   get nit-picky with individuals. Don't single anyone out or allow the
   staff to attack or single out others. Instead, ask each individual to
   share what they would improve from their own story/assignment. How
   could they make it even better?
   Staff meetings can be an effective tool for team-building and morale.
   Bring treats or allow students to bring in treats to share. Food and
   drinks are effective motivation tools with teens and can change the
   atmosphere immediately.
   [JournalismPost5.png]
   Organization is key when producing a school newspaper or yearbook. You
   must have everything planned out in advance. Staff meetings are a great
   time to plan your publication and assign duties to students. A yearbook
   will require a ladder that should be displayed at all times in the
   classroom or office. The ladder should include the contents of every
   single page in the yearbook.
   When you are planning a newspaper, you should have some areas
   designated for regular features. For example, the first page will
   always have the latest late-breaking or headlining news, the second
   page often has the staff box (listing the staff members, positions,
   contact names/numbers or emails, and a brief staff policy or
   objective). It will also usually have continued stories from the first
   page. On the remaining pages, designate a page or area for features,
   opinions (which would include movie and restaurant reviews), and
   sports. You could also designate an area for photos from around school
   (this is always easy to include on the last page). By having a
   designated spot for everything, it makes it so much easier for the
   designers to lay out the paper.
   Students should also have a clear idea about their story when they are
   preparing to write it. They can download this FREE Reporter's Checklist
   to organize the essentials of their story. It includes an example so
   students can see how it is used.
   [JournalismPostFreebie2.png]
   [JournalismPost6.png]
   Finally, you want your students to have ownership in their work--to
   feel connected and an integral part of the overall product. There is a
   thin line between being an advisor and being a micro-managing editor.
   It can be hard to allow students to make mistakes, but it is essential
   for them to learn and take ownership over their work.* Your job is to
   provide the tools; their job is to use them and create with them.
   Ways to encourage ownership include:
   • Allow students to generate story ideas.
   • Allow students to pick their own yearbook theme.
   • Allow students to decide which fonts to use (within reason).
   • Allow students to choose their own assignments.
   • Require students to peer edit: choose student editors (take
   volunteers and select the most competent) and make them responsible for
   editing all stories, photo captions, and the layout of the publication.
   • Don't edit or rewrite student work yourself; allow students to make
   mistakes.* It's OK to let students know that their story has some
   errors that they should correct, but if they fail to make the changes,
   don't do it for them.
   [JournalismPostNotebook2.png]
   *I do have one exception: when producing a yearbook that parents,
   students, and staff have purchased, it is important to strive for
   perfection. If a student accidentally misspells a name, by all means,
   correct it if you catch it before it goes to print. In this case, being
   a last-minute editor is OK. I'd rather have happy buyers than students
   upset because their name was misspelled in something as permanent as
   the yearbook.
   I hope these tips will help you as you navigate teaching journalism.
   It's helpful to seek out other teachers who are in the same boat, but
   so often you may be the only journalism teacher in your school or even
   district. Look for others on social media (Twitter is an excellent
   tool; search #journalismteacher) or connect on sites such
   as https://www.schooljournalism.org/.

   Activities, Classroom Management, Motivation

10 Techniques to Motivate Student Progress

   [motivate%2Bsquare.jpg]
   by Secondary Sara
   The Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts have a secret that more teachers need to
   steal. (Stay with me on this one...)
   If you want to be an Eagle Scout, then you need to earn certain merit
   badges. If you want to earn a merit badge, then you have to view the
   list of requirements for that merit badge (a checklist of action
   steps). If you've completed a requirement, then the Scoutmaster
   initials and dates each checklist item in your personal book to confirm
   that you did finish it.
   In my personal experiences with Scouting, I've seen how motivating
   those lists of requirements can be. Yes, there are external motivators
   (with the reward being the merit badge and the respective ranks it can
   help you acquire), but there's also something very compelling about a
   to-do list with that blank spot next to it, waiting to be checked off.
   I've been thinking a lot about this setup in the last five years,
   especially as a teacher, watching the students in my classrooms change.
   In a world filled with instant gratification and frequent feedback
   (i.e. social media comments/likes), many of my students are responding
   well to short-term goals, faster teacher affirmation, and small rewards
   on a longer trail of learning.
   I've been gradually experimenting with ways I can do the following:
     * Give students feedback faster (instead of waiting on me to return a
       grade)
     * Motivate all students to take more action steps (even those who
       hate "work")
     * Praise students for doing the right thing
     * Promote positive, proactive behaviors

   While I realize that most teachers are wary of overdoing rewards,
   stickers, prizes, or the "everyone gets a trophy" philosophy, that's
   not what I'm going for, either. Many older students just want
   recognition or feedback, and most of the ideas shown below don't have a
   carrot at the end.
   Below is a list of some of the tools and techniques I've been using in
   my middle school ELA classroom. These ideas are easily adaptable so
   that you can make them work best for you!
   1. Stamp Sheets and Checklists
   Stamps are my NEW BEST FRIEND. My favorite tool is a simple Bingo
   dauber to stamp students' reading passports (see below). The stamp
   sheet you see here is a non-graded tool that I use alongside the
   Accelerated Reader program that my district requires; in other words,
   it's a motivational tool for independent reading so that I can reward
   students for positive reading behaviors, like meeting a goal or pacing
   their reading wisely.
   [motivate%2B2.jpg]
   My second favorite tool is Crayola's emoji stamp markers, especially if
   the circles being stamped are smaller (see photo). What you see here is
   this year's (new) way that I'm tracking student points that are earned
   in our Grammar House Cup game. (See this blog post to learn more about
   that game.) Stamping these sheets has been the most effective way I've
   found to track student action steps.
   [motivate%2B3.jpg]
   Get BOTH stamp sheets you see above FOR FREE at this link! (The
   templates also come with descriptors for what the grammar circles
   mean.)
   2. Smaller reading deadlines
   Some students aren't ready to just "read to page 100 by Monday" and
   need to learn how to read a little every night. These pacing bookmarks
   have been epic for teaching students better reading habits!
   3. Certificates and Superlatives
   In addition to whatever comments you may write on a rubric or
   assignment, you might want students to feel more pride in their work.
   One option is to use these certificates for public speaking, essays, or
   creative writing, which could be quietly stapled to student work or
   even celebrated more publicly in class.
   4. Units in a Game Board format
   This is a super-customizable route that isn't as hard as it may seem.
   If your unit has a linear list of action steps, you might like framing
   it more visually in a game board! (Learn more in this blog post, OR
   download my game board templates here.)
   [game%2Bthumbnail%2B1.jpg]
   5. Setting a Timer
   This could just be me and my students, but lately I've found that
   setting an actual timer works better than just telling students to get
   started, or even telling them that they only have a certain number of
   minutes. If you want increased focus, use a timer that they can see or
   hear.
   6. Short Term Challenges
   If you want to try a 24-hour challenge, 1-week challenge, or even a
   30-Day challenge, the pressure of a deadline can motivate some students
   to not procrastinate and to get started sooner. One example is this
   editable 30-Day Challenge for ELA.
   7. Authentic Audiences for Writing
   Bringing in external "judges" from the community was one of the best
   things I did during my student teaching in high school. Get more ideas
   in this blog post, co-written with Nouvelle ELA, 6 Guest Speakers to
   Invite to Your English Class.
   8. Positive Peer Pressure
   There's a specific literature unit I do each year in which we complete
   Chapter Study Guides and let students verbally quiz each other. It's a
   great way to find out who did (or didn't) read while still controlling
   the situation to prevent shaming. If students know this is coming,
   needing to be "on the ball" in front of their peers is a huge
   motivator!
   [New%2BCover.jpg]
   9. Being in the Here and Now
   I suspect that most English teachers are already making strong
   real-world connections in their classrooms, but some students may still
   be too deep in the "here and now" to be motivated by grades, a future
   grade level, or college. Little ways to connect the topic to their
   present selves can sometimes help. One example is this FREE "Which
   Punctuation Mark Are You?" quiz.
   [punctuation%2Bquiz%2Bcover.jpg]
   10. Using Videos
   Whether you use a quick video to hook students into a lesson, employ
   the Flipped Classroom model, or let students make videos themselves,
   I've found that anything involving a video is more likely to get
   completed than other tasks or forms of homework.

Tips for Faster Grading

   [woman%2Bat%2Bdesk.jpg]
   Put up your hand if you love nothing more than spending your Sunday
   afternoon grading a pile of student papers.
   What? No takers?
   Of course not. As much as we know the importance of assessment in the
   learning process, we all want to spend less time doing it, right? So,
   in the hopes of helping you all out with that grading beast, we thought
   we'd compile some of our best tips.
   1. USE RUBRICS TO BE MORE EFFICIENT
   As a first-year teacher, I spent tons of time writing meticulous notes
   on each student’s paper. I didn’t mark all of the grammar errors - I’d
   definitely learned not to waste my time on that! - but I did make tons
   of suggestions for improvement. Then, when I handed the papers back to
   students, they immediately stuffed them in their backpacks without a
   second glance. Sigh.
   [nouvelle.jpg]
   You can make your comments digestible by sticking to two positive notes
   and one focus for improvement. (That good ol’ “compliment sandwich”!)
   Write these notes directly on the rubric. You’ll have to focus your
   commentary, which means less time writing for you and fewer notes to
   overwhelm your students. And, since all of your students will receive
   three comments, there’s no dreading tons of ‘red ink’ all over the
   paper! Read more about how I use rubrics to make grading more
   efficient. -
   ~Nouvelle ELA
   2. USE CHECKLISTS AND HIGHLIGHTERS
   My greatest tools for faster grading are checklists and highlighters.
   First, I do not grade everything. I decide on my focus areas and then I
   create a checklist that has all of the comments I would usually make on
   that type of assignment. That way, I can just put a checkmark beside
   what I want to say, rather than writing or typing it all out. Then, I
   will choose a couple of places to highlight to show students what they
   did well and what they could improve upon.
   [journal%2Bone.jpg]
   Another thing I've added to my grading toolkit is that I ask the
   students to highlight where they have met certain criteria. So, if we
   were working on embedding and citing quotes, they will highlight where
   they did it well. If I wanted them to use multiple techniques to
   develop an idea, they would highlight each technique in a different
   colour. That way, I can quickly find what I'm looking for, plus it puts
   more responsibility in the students' hands. You can read more about how
   I use highlighters for grading on this post and get more tips for
   grading faster on this one.
   ~ROOM 213
   3. MAKE A BETTER PLAN:
   [desk%2Bcalendar.%2Bjpg.jpg]
   When I first started teaching, I would leave school with a bag full of
   papers to grade that haunted my weekends. I spent entirely too much
   time outside of school hours grading papers, and the grading often
   wasn’t efficient because it felt like such an imposition on my free
   time. My tip is to set up the systems in place to do as much of the
   marking at school as you can. When you are marking “on the clock,” it’s
   often far more efficient as you are in work mode. Although bringing
   marking home may not be something you can avoid altogether, you can
   make it far less by doing the following:
   1.  Plan out your major assessments strategically so that due dates
   line up with a less busy times in your schedule (if you run the drama
   club, for example, don’t make major assessments due when the school
   play is happening).
   2. Make major assessments for your classes due at different times.
   It’s far easier to mark 25 papers than it is 90.
   3. Avoid the interruptions from chatty co-workers. You are more likely
   to be interrupted before school or after school, so use your prep
   period (or part of it) to grade instead, but find a place where you can
   hide so no one will interrupt.
   4. If you have your students read silently each day for a few minutes,
   consider changing that up and giving them a good chunk of time each
   week to do it and use that time to grade.
   ~Presto Plans
   4. DON'T GRADE EVERYTHING!
   One of the things I’ve learned over the years is that not everything
   needs to be graded. Yes, I admit, it’s easier to motivate students if
   they know they are getting graded for an assignment. However, there’s
   no reason not to give completion grades for assignments that are
   practicing skills. I do not “grade” journal entries, bell ringers/exit
   slips, silent reading, rough drafts, or even homework assignments. For
   those, students get a completion grade: as long as they completed it,
   they earn the maximum number of points. It’s much easier to skim those
   assignments to make sure they are grasping the concepts. Then I have
   much more time to put into grading their assessments: quizzes, tests,
   and final drafts of essays. Students learn quickly that if they put
   little effort into the completion assignments, it will show in their
   assessment score. I make the assessments worth a lot more points, so
   they learn this early in the year. That helps with motivating them to
   put forth effort in the daily work.
   ~Tracee Orman
   5. DON'T BE A COPY EDITOR:
   [daring.jpg] Whenever I grade larger writing assignments, I don’t spend
   excessive time copyediting my students’ work. Instead, I only focus on
   a few writing elements to assess. Further-more, when I grade, I keep a
   notebook handy. Over the several days that it takes me to comb through
   dozens of essays, I keep notes about common writing mistakes and
   weaknesses that I found. When I pass back their work, we review these
   in a quick reflection mini-unit. When it’s time to grade the next major
   writing assignment, I’ll use the elements from our writing reflection
   as my areas of focus. This not only helps cut down my grading time by
   eliminating excessive marks on student papers, but it also helps drive
   my instruction.
   ~The Daring English Teacher
   6. USE PORTFOLIOS
   As English teachers, it is easy to get buried under endless piles of
   marking. One strategy I use is to have students work with a portfolio
   (I use folders in my classroom). They can work on several pieces of
   writing, edit, do peer editing, and then submit the work that they feel
   best represents their skills or learning. This way, I am not marking
   everything they are working on, and students appreciate that they have
   some choice in the work that I assess.
   ~Addie Williams
   7. BUY YOURSELF A GRADING STAMP
   [0000001a.png]
   Yes! There is such a thing. I discovered this grading stamp a little
   over a year ago and it has saved my life in so many ways. While I
   personally use a rubric for the final assessment piece, the stamp is
   perfect when making quick edits to papers and I also use this for peer
   editing. Just type in "essay grading stamp" on eBay and you will see a
   bunch of different options come up!
    ~The Classroom Sparrow

Using Nonfiction to Engage Reluctant Readers

   As English teachers, we often face a huge obstacle between our goal
   (encouraging lifelong readers!) and our accountability to standardized
   testing. This obstacle? Student reading levels. With our
   high-performing students, we can almost imagine leaving them to face
   the test alone and we know they’d be fine. With the rest? Well, it’s
   unimaginable. Therefore, we’re tempted to sacrifice student interest in
   the name of test preparation. This is the way to get our reluctant
   readers on track, we tell ourselves.
   How can we balance rigorous learning with engaging nonfiction? We’d
   want that, right?
   Yes.
   It’s Danielle from Nouvelle ELA, and today, I want to tackle
   nonfiction. Some of you love it; some of you dread it. Here are three
   ways to use nonfiction to engage reluctant readers. None of these are
   “drill and kill,” but each meets the reader where they are and supports
   them as they work toward grade-level skills.

1.       Use nonfiction to develop background knowledge.

   We know that our students can have varying background knowledge when we
   begin a new novel. This could be a matter of culture and exposure,
   vocabulary level, or understanding of genre. One way we can scaffold
   the reading experience for reluctant readers is to strengthen their
   background knowledge.
   Consider, for example, The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. What
   did Fitzgerald’s contemporary audience know and understand that our
   students might not? His audience exemplified the American zeitgeist and
   Post-War sentiments of the era, and both inform the novel. Our students
   don’t have easy access to this knowledge. Our reluctant readers will
   just write it off as “too difficult.”
   [Nonfiction%2Bto%2BEngage%2BReluctant%2BReaders%2B05.jpg]
   Once you generate a list of topics (as I’ve done here for The Great
   Gatsby), you can find nonfiction and primary sources to support
   students. For example, I use this Close Reading to introduce students
   to the quality of life in the Post-War United States. This is also a
   good opportunity to provide key content vocabulary that students will
   later see in the novel.

2.       Strengthen connections through literature.

   In the last section, I discussed providing access to literature through
   nonfiction. You can also approach it from the other direction. Often,
   age-appropriate and engaging literature is a key to understanding
   denser nonfiction. Literature can also go a long way to make content in
   nonfiction texts more relatable for students.
   Let’s look at Patron Saints of Nothing by Randy Ribay. In this novel,
   the main character travels to the Philippines and learns about the
   impact of Duterte’s war on drugs first-hand. This book is accessible to
   many reluctant readers and easy to pair with a closer look at current
   events.
   You can also use shorter stories to connect to informational text
   targets. I created a series of reading intervention escape games with
   just this in mind. In Burnbridge Breakouts, each game follows a
   different protagonist. Students collaborate to solve puzzles and
   riddles to reveal clues to the bigger mystery of the series. Even
   though the reading level of the stories is below grade level, each game
   comes with related informational tasks at grade level. They explore
   topics broached in the games, conduct research, and write procedural
   texts. However, their perseverance is sustained by the interest in the
   topic sparked by the game. Literature becomes the bridge to more
   difficult nonfiction.

3.       Inspire creative writing.

   You can also use nonfiction to inspire creative writing. Students are
   less constrained with creative writing and more easily accept that
   there’s “more than one right answer.” Because of this, they’re using
   their understanding of nonfiction to support their imagination. This is
   effective because it puts the onus on them: they’ll look back and make
   sure they’ve understood for the sake of their story rather than the
   sake of a test question.
   An example of this is my resource, Abandoned Places. Students read an
   article about ten abandoned places from around the world. Each section
   is short and attainable for reluctant readers, developing a sense of
   achievement along the way. Then, students choose one place as the
   setting for a piece of “Flash Fiction.” This quick writing decreases
   students’ ability to be self-critical, since the writing time flies by
   in a “flash”. They don’t have time to make it perfect! (You could have
   them revise a draft later, though.)

Moving Forward with Reluctant Readers

   You want to instill a love of reading in your students, and you will!
   The key is providing accessible, age-appropriate texts and doing
   different activities with each one. Students can read for enjoyment,
   read for test preparation, and read to inspire writing! With some
   resources and inspiration, you can meet students where they are and
   help them on their journey to mastery.

Teaching Active Listening Skills

   [ListeningSkills_SquareImages.jpg]
   by Stacey Lloyd
   In today’s world, teaching students to be effective, active listeners,
   is a vital task. In an environment of quick click, constant scrolling,
   pithy soundbites, the ability to be fully present to the people
   speaking around us is a significant skill to develop. But that is just
   it: it is a skill to be mastered and constantly worked on; it requires
   plenty of practice to fully develop the effective habits of a good
   listener. As teachers, we need to provide students with opportunities
   to discuss, exchange ideas, and listen meaningfully; we also need to
   give them the tools to do so effectively.
   Why Teach Listening Skills?
   There are countless reasons why learning to become a good listener is
   important: not just in terms of developing critical thinking abilities,
   but also learning to be an empathetic human being. Some such reasons
   include (but are not limited to) the following:
     * When we listen effectively, we open ourselves up to opportunities
       for learning and personal growth.
     * As good listeners, we improve our ability to think critically, by
       being able to fully engage in a more informed way.
     * Displaying the attributes of a good listener makes space for others
       to be able to express themselves openly, helping to build
       relationships and exchange ideas.
     * True listening helps avoid misunderstandings, and limits the
       potential for just talking past one another.
     * When really listening to the thoughts and ideas of others, we can
       develop empathy and compassion.

   If the above goals are reached, we set students up to be more active
   learners, effective communicators, and attuned critical thinkers.  But
   how do we practically do so in the classroom?
   1. Provide Opportunities for Listening
   (Almost) every lesson should provide students with ample opportunities
   to exercise their listening skills. Whether it is through listening to
   instructions and lectures, paired conversations, class discussions, or
   media experiences: students should be encouraged to actively listen to
   others, over and over again. Yet, more importantly, they should be
   regularly reminded, when doing so, that they need to be exercising the
   skills of a good listener, and they should be reflecting on their own
   skill development in this area.

   for teaching listening skills in the classroom!
   2. But what are the Attributes of an Effective Listener?

   You certainly know it when you encounter a good listener, and this can
   be a great place to start: ask students who comes to mind when they
   think of somebody they know personally, who really listens when one
   talks to them. Discuss what makes them such a good example, and mindmap
   these attributes on a piece of chart paper. Students will, most likely,
   describe someone who listens with their whole body, leans into
   conversations, makes eye contact, gives visual cues such as nodding or
   smiling; somebody who asks thoughtful follow up questions, who doesn’t
   interject with their opinions when you are speaking to them; somebody
   who isn’t clearly distracted while listening, who isn’t merely thinking
   about what they want to say next; someone who gives positive
   reinforcement during a conversation and remembers what you say;
   somebody who picks up on the emotions and feelings of a speaker as they
   are fully present to the moment of listening; somebody who remembers
   what was said in a speech or lecture, and can summarize it effectively.
   If students aren’t forthcoming with these attributes, ask scaffolded
   questions to draw them out. Then, leave this mindmap up on the
   classroom wall to regularly reference and remind students.

   3. Give Students the Tools to Practice
   We cannot just tell students: “be good listeners”. We need to give them
   tangible tools to help them develop these skills. The activity
   mentioned above can be a great starting point, but there are other ways
   to reinforce the concepts. For example:
     * When holding a class discussion, pause halfway and ask students:
       “How is your body language right now indicating whether or not you
       are listening?”
     * When watching a TEDtalk or video clip, teach students to sketchnote
       as a way of listening to the ideas presented, and engaging with
       them, rather than daydreaming and drifting off.
     * Engage in paired discussion time where one person remains
       completely silent for a set time (usually a minute or two) and
       simply listens, then echoes back to the speaker what they have
       heard them say.
     * During group discussions, split the class into two and have an
       outer circle observe and play the role of “listeners.” During the
       discussion they could try and visually represent what is said
       through drawings or diagrams. At the end, they can be asked to
       summarize common threads or conflicting arguments.

   4. Model Good Listening Skills
   This one cannot be emphasized enough: students are highly observant of
   the behaviors we exhibit in the classroom. We cannot expect them to be
   effective listeners if they see us not valuing the skill. While it can
   be difficult to be fully present to what a student is saying when we
   have a million and one thoughts rushing around our brain during a
   lesson, we need to make sure that when a student is expressing thoughts
   and ideas, we - as the teacher - are engaging fully with eye contact,
   giving visual cues to listening, echoing back what has been said,
   validating contributions, etc. The more we do this, the more
   opportunities we give students to learn from our demonstrations.
   5. Encourage Students to Reflect on their Listening Abilities
   [ListeningSkills_SquareImages2.jpg]
   Self-reflection is a vital aspect of any meaningful learning
   opportunity (see here for more on teaching students to be
   self-reflective), and equally so for the acquisition of good listening
   skills. All too often, students think that if they are hearing others,
   they are listening. But we need to make them more aware of their actual
   proficiency in this area, and instill a mindset of growth and
   improvement. As a regular bell-ringer exercise ask students: How well
   did you listen in class today? How could you have been a more active
   listener today? Download this FREE reflection page to help students
   reflect on their listening skills
   Earnest Hemmingway said: “When people talk, listen completely. Most
   people never listen.” Let’s take his advice and teach our students to
   listen completely.
