What Our Customers are Saying

   Review Geek
   "I’ve been a fan of multi-monitor setups for over a decade, and I’ve
   been thrilled to see Windows expand its support for them as the
   releases progress. But if you’re serious about getting productive with
   your monitor array, DisplayFusion is a must-have addition to your
   setup."
   -- Review Geek, Jun 2019
   Jay W.
   "I have to take this opportunity as a longtime lurker on the forums to
   comment on what an insane workhorse you are, and how incredible your
   work ethic is. Your support content output is so ridiculously prolific
   that when I have a question regarding DisplayFusion, I don’t search to
   determine IF you’ve already addressed it as much as to find WHERE
   you’ve addressed it. (This license key thing was the rare exception
   where I actually needed individual attention.)
   Anyways, I’m sure you already know this, but I felt a duty to reinforce
   the fact that you are always helping many more people than meets the
   eye (probably by a factor of 10 or more, in some cases!) even if we are
   silent and unappreciative most of the time.
   Your (and the rest of your engineering team’s) support service is
   really something else - keep up the great work."
   -- Jay W., Jun 2019
   Keith H.
   "Its clean simple to operate and does exactly what it is supposed to
   do. I have been using it for longer than I care to remember and
   speaking as the Ex Senior IT Engineer for Marconi and Paradigm GPT I
   think Its fair to say I know what I'm talking about. This is a very
   good program at a very good price - if you have a multi monitor system,
   its a slam dunk."
   -- Keith H., May 2019
   Nathaniel R.
   "You guys seriously rock. I can count of one hand the software
   companies that I deal with that provide this level of support, actually
   listen to their customers about feature requests, and have elegantly
   designed tools. Binary Fortress is one of those companies. Please let
   everyone know there, that we are extremely impressed with your company.
   While it might not matter in the long term, I will recommend your
   products to everyone I know!"
   -- Nathaniel R., May 2019
