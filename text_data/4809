Lifelong learning and development
in robots and humans

   poppyInria4 The Flowers project-team, at Inria and Ensta ParisTech,
   studies mechanisms that can allow robots and humans to acquire
   autonomously and cumulatively repertoires of novel skills over extended
   periods of time.

   This includes mechanisms for learning by self-exploration, as well as
   learning through interaction with peers, for the acquisition of both
   sensorimotor and social skills.  Sensorimotor skills include
   locomotion, affordance learning, active manipulation. Interactive
   skills include grounded language use and understanding, adaptive
   interaction protocols, and human-robot collaboration.

   Our approach is organized along two strands of research:
     * Artificial intelligence: constructing machines and robots, inspired
       by animal cognitive development, and capable of lifelong
       development, adaptation and interaction with the physical and
       social world.
     * Cognitive Science: Elaborating computer and robotic models as tools
       for understanding developmental processes in humans.

   Our project-team, headed by Pierre-Yves Oudeyer (Inria) and co-started
   with David Filliat (Ensta ParisTech Cognitive Robotics Group), focuses
   in particular on the study of developmental mechanisms that guide
   efficient open-ended learning of novel skills in large real world
   environments. In particular, we study:
     * Intrinsically motivated multitask learning and exploration,
       information seeking and active learning, including artificial
       curiosity;
     * Social learning, e.g. learning by imitation or demonstration, which
       implies both issues related to machine learning and human-robot
       interaction;
     * Mechanisms for learning to sequence and compose actions to reach
       goals, especially within the framework or reinforcement learning;
     * The role of embodiment, in particular through the concept
       of morphological computation, as well as the structure of motor
       primitives/muscle synegies that can leverage the properties of
       morphology and physics;
     * Maturational constraints which can allow the progressive release of
       novel sensorimotor degrees of freedom to be explored;

   The FLOWERS project-team is located on two sites: Inria Bordeaux
   Sud-Ouest and ENSTA-Paristech in Paris.

HFSP Curiosity project starting in december 2016

   In this project, in collaboration with cognitive neuroscientist J.
   Gottlieb (Univ. Columbia, NY, US) and developmental psychologist C.
   Kidd (Univ. Rochester, US), we target to construct a comprehensive
   theory that defines curiosity in the context of quantitative models of
   learning and decision making and probes its neural mechanisms. We are
   looking for outstanding postdoc applications.

Second Interdisciplinary Symposium on Information Seeking, Curiosity and
Attention, Sept. 2016

   Together with J. Gottlieb and T. Gliga, we have co-organized the Second
   Interdisciplinary Symposium on Information Seeking, Curiosity and
   Attention in London, in september 2016. This great event has gathered
   researchers from neuroscience, psychology and computer science/machine
   learning: J. Nelson, D. Markant, R. Ligneul, S. Kouider, M. Gruber, K.
   Murayama, J. O’Reilly, G. Baldassarre, P. Dayan, P-Y. Oudeyer, K. Doya,
   W. Shultz, A. Bell, L. Hunt, J. Gottlieb, D. Bell, K. Begus, L. Goupil,
    L. Feigenson, D. Bavelier, T. Gliga.
   Most videos and slides of the symposium are available on
   the Neurocuriosity 2016 symposium web site.

Poppy: Open-Source 3D printed humanoid robot for science, art and education

   Link to information about the Poppy humanoid robot : Poppy Project web
   site. Poppy is an open-source 3D printed robotic platform designed by
   the Flowers team. Poppy Humanoid robot was initially built to study the
   impact of the body on sensorimotor development and cognition: it makes
   it possible to really consider the body as an experimental variable.
   See article at Humanoids 2013 conference. It then evolved into an open
   platform for interdisciplinary invention, building and programming of
   robots, used in science, art and education.
