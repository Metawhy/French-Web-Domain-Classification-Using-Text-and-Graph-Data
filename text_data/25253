The Best Hot Air Balloon Ride Next to Prague

   A ride in a hot air balloon is probably on everyone’s bucket list. But
   if I say “hot air balloon”, the first thing that probably pops into
   your mind is Cappadocia in Turkey or Bagan in Myanmar. But what about
   the Czech Republic? Surprisingly, the vicinity of Prague is full of
   history. The region offers incredible natural landscapes and historical
   places such as gorgeous castles that you can actually see from above!
   When I came across the opportunity to go up in a hot air balloon around
   Prague, I had to do it! This type of rides offers a unique…

10 Spots for taking Breathtaking photos of the Charles Bridge in Prague

   With its foundation laid in 1357, the Charles Bridge is the oldest
   bridge in Prague spanning the River Vltava. It is a symbol of the Czech
   Republic and one of the city’s most iconic sights, making it a hotspot
   for tourists. Since more than 8 million people visit Prague every year,
   it is safe to assume that most of them will end up walking the gorgeous
   500 meter-long cobblestone bridge. With this being said, It can get
   pretty difficult to find the best spots to photograph the Charles
   Bridge if you have never been to Prague before. Lucky you, I…

   The capital of Slovakia, Bratislava, is probably one of the least known

   Bratislava is overshadowed by its famous neighbors Prague, Budapest,

Top 10 Ways to See Tulips near Amsterdam

   The tulip is a national symbol in Holland. Every spring, the
   Netherlands burst into a rainbow of yellow, purple, red, pink, white
   and orange blooms. Tulips are literally everywhere (from farmers’
   fields to cute souvenirs shops), making the country overwhelmingly
   beautiful. This patchwork of colors attracts millions of visitors each
   year. If you plan on visiting Amsterdam, finding tulips are just a bike
   or train ride away! In the article, I’ve listed down the best way to
   see the tulips near Amsterdam. Disclaimer: I was invited by the

Luxury Stay in Bratislava at the Grand Hotel River Park

   Last weekend, my boyfriend and I were invited by Luxury Collection by
   Marriott to stay in Bratislava at their Grand Hotel River Park. During
   my travels, I have stayed in a lot of different types of accommodations
   from bunk beds in several hostels’ dorm rooms to guest houses and
   luxury resorts by the sea. On my blog, however, I have always written
   about the destinations and not the accommodations. I want to change
   this because I believe that the place you stay at also becomes part of
   your travel experience. So in this article, let me share my experience

   Praha (Prague in Czech!) is one of the most gorgeous and photogenic
   cities in the world. Popular for its terracotta-colored rooftop and for

   Luckily, there are a lot of viewpoints where you can get a gorgeous

   Spring is coming soon and throughout the months of March and April,
   Prague gradually takes on lovely shades of white and pink. The cherry
   blossoms in Prague are particularly beautiful because they perfectly
   fit with the romantic architecture of the city. If you are planning a
   trip to see famous blossoms in 2019, keep in mind that most blooms
   usually only last several weeks. Changes in weather conditions can also
   impact the flowering period so you should always try to look it up
   before your visit! So, without further ado, here is the ultimate list

Luxury Stay in Bratislava at the Grand Hotel River Park

   Last weekend, my boyfriend and I were invited by Luxury Collection by
   Marriott to stay in Bratislava at their Grand Hotel River Park. During
   my travels, I have stayed in a lot of different types of accommodations
   from bunk beds in several hostels’ dorm rooms to guest houses and
   luxury resorts by the sea. On my blog, however, I have always written
   about the destinations and not the accommodations. I want to change
   this because I believe that the place you stay at also becomes part of
   your travel experience. So in this article, let me share my experience

   Spring is coming soon and throughout the months of March and April,
   Prague gradually takes on lovely shades of white and pink. The cherry
   blossoms in Prague are particularly beautiful because they perfectly
   fit with the romantic architecture of the city. If you are planning a
   trip to see famous blossoms in 2019, keep in mind that most blooms
   usually only last several weeks. Changes in weather conditions can also

The Best Hot Air Balloon Ride Next to Prague

   A ride in a hot air balloon is probably on everyone’s bucket list. But
   if I say “hot air balloon”, the first thing that probably pops into
   your mind is Cappadocia in Turkey or Bagan in Myanmar. But what about
   the Czech Republic? Surprisingly, the vicinity of Prague is full of
   history. The region offers incredible natural landscapes and historical
   places such as gorgeous castles that you can actually see from above!

10 Spots for taking Breathtaking photos of the Charles Bridge in Prague

   With its foundation laid in 1357, the Charles Bridge is the oldest
   bridge in Prague spanning the River Vltava. It is a symbol of the Czech
   Republic and one of the city’s most iconic sights, making it a hotspot
   for tourists. Since more than 8 million people visit Prague every year,
   it is safe to assume that most of them will end up walking the gorgeous
   500 meter-long cobblestone bridge. With this being said, It can get
   pretty difficult to find the best spots to photograph the Charles
   Bridge if you have never been to Prague before. Lucky you, I…

   really have those beautiful trees changing colors and turning bright
   red, orange or yellow. Usually, everything turns brown and the leaves
