Support this plugin

   Maintaining this plugin takes a lot of time, time that I have to share
   with my work and my studies. If you appreciate my work, feel free to
   comment, rate, or even donate to the plugin. I need your help to
   continue maintaining the plugin, and bringing more features.

     * Example TinyMCE glossary term form
     * Example TinyMCE tooltip form
     * jQuery based Glossary term A to Z and term list
     * Glossary index shortcodes

Installation

   Either install through admin panel (this is the eaiest way), or:
    1. Upload ithoughts-tooltip-glossary.zip to the /wp-content/plugins/
       directory
    2. Unzip the archive
    3. Activate the plugin through the ‚ÄòPlugins‚Äô menu in WordPress

FAQ

     Does this plugin create any new tables?

   No. It uses custom post types and taxonomies.

     None of the details pages are working!

   Please resave your rewrite rules: Settings > Permalinks > Save Changes
   (just click the button)

     I got an error when loading my glossary tips

   It may be a permalink problem. Go to Settings > Permalinks and click
   Save Changes

     It doesn‚Äôt do anything?

   Check if jQuery is loaded.
   For glossary terms only, you have to add the terms (Tooltip Glossary >
   Add New Term) and then use the appropriate TinyMCE button to link the
   text with that glossary term

   Installation Instructions
          Either install through admin panel (this is the eaiest way), or:

Excellent tooltip plugin

   flongpre April 26, 2018
   While looking for a glossary / tooltip plugin in 2016, I found this one
   and I use it on 2 big sites since then. With the WPML compatibility and
   many other improvements, I was always happy to discover new features as
   we use it. The plugin is upgraded frequently and very well maintained
   by Gerkin who was always quick to fix bugs and answer questions in the
   forum.

A free five star plugin!!

   bobby1kenobi December 1, 2017
   To be honest I tried them all to find the best solution and here it is!
   This is the best tooltip plugin. Nice, smooth design, easy to use and
   to setup. Did I forgot something ? Yes- it's totally FREE. Thumbs up!
   üëçüëç

Great plugin, responsive help

   handwovenbox October 23, 2017
   Many thanks for the plugin. It works great and Gerkin has answered my
   questions quickly in the support forums.

Exactly what I was looking for!

   jorgenheld July 22, 2017
   Easy to install and activate. Perfect with the "Advanced attributes"
   button. I didn't realize that the option existed until I read the
   manual üôÇ Just mark the text string (or in my case a link) and click on
   the "Add a Tooltip" button. Add the text you want to appear in the pop
   up window. Done! Excellent work by the plugin developer!

Strange and Useless

   ist4000 November 21, 2016
   No function is working properly. The plugin does random things with no
   evident logical connection between each other. Very strange and
   absolutely useless. No description for shortcodes to try out things.
   Just the not working buttons in the tool panel of the editor.

Plugin with some issues but great active support

   Jos Klever September 3, 2016
   A client asked me to solve some issues on their website. It appeared to
   be impossible to update this plugin from 1.1.6 to 2.x, so I created a
   support ticket. Together we did some research and found a few
   improvements in the update process. During this process some other bugs
   were found and solved pretty quickly. Today with the release of 2.3.2
   every issue we found, is solved, so keep up the good work!

          configure the plugin and you‚Äôre done!

   Which web browsers work best with this plugin
          Though designed to work on most browsers, Zendesk Chat works

          or later (Mac, PC, or Linux), Safari 2 or later (Mac), Google
          Chrome (PC, Mac).

   I managed to install the plugin but cannot link up to Zendesk Chat.
          Why?
          The plugin tries to link up with Zendesk Chat by connecting
          using a few approaches including PHP Curl. If the outgoing
          connections are blocked (eg. by a firewall), please request your
          server administrator.

          Alternatively, you can also manually include the script in the
          footer file (‚Äúwp-content/themes/default/footer.php‚Äù in your
          wordpress installation).

   Is it free to use?
          The plugin comes with a free plan specially tailored for
          WordPress users. Power users can purchase upgrade options
          anytime.

   How can I chat with more visitors at the same time?
          You can easily do so by upgrading to a better plan. To find out
          more about the plans and features we offer, please visit

I like Zendesk a lot but WP plugin is disaster

   Marin Stoyanov January 11, 2018
   I thought that installing the plugin made by Zendesk team will be easy
   and i won't face any issues. Instead now I'm here and I write my
   review. WordPress Zendesk plugin is real disaster. It doesn't allow me
   to login to my account. I'm sure that my password and email are
   correct. I tripe-checked them and they are correct but the plugin
   doesn't allow me to login to my existing Zendesk account. Some
   suggestions for the authors: 1) We live in 21st century, logging with
   my real Zendesk username and password is real thread. Instead you can
   use API key, provide temporary access key or use other more intelligent
   way to associate WP website with Zendesk account 2) Most WP plugins,
   that require configuration after being activated, usually have a
   Settings link next to 'Details'. You're huge enough to do it.

Data leaked?

   Phil September 10, 2017
   The Zendesk Chat system itself works quite well, from what little
   chance we had to use it. However, a few months ago we received
   chat/messages from someone else's Zendesk account, which is hugely
   concering. I contacted support but haven't heard anything back in
   weeks. Very worrying! If you communicate any kind of private/sensitive
   data I'd highly recommend avoiding Zendesk Chat, possibly even Zendesk
   itself too since they are closely linked.

Cuidado. Cobran√ßa automatica.

   Rodolfo December 26, 2016
   Cuidado. Instalei o Zopim e paguei por 2 agentes por 6 seis meses. Ap√≥s
   isso o sistema renovou automaticamente, mesmo sem meu site estar no ar
   mais e mesmo sem usar o sistema deles. Entrei em contato e me
   informaram que n√£o devolveriam o dinheiro porque j√° havia passado o
   tempo para reclamar e que isso estava previsto, quando assinei. Tenho
   os e-mails, que compravam isso. Tomem muito cuidado! N√£o recomendo!

Easy and fast

   albaintrade September 22, 2016
   Very good application easy and fast... You can try on my website

nice plugin

   nicopozena79 September 10, 2016
   Pretty good service

I love this program, but it slows my site

   ddrevik September 3, 2016
   I love this plugin. It helps our website visitors tremendously to be
   able to ask questions and interact with us. Many are reluctant to call
   or email for fear of being inundated with sales calls, so this allows
   them to stay at arms reach until they get comfortable with us. Why only
   3 stars then? The speed. When I load the Zopim widget, my homepage load
   time goes from 6.5s to 12.3s. I can't have visitors waiting that long
   for our homepage to load. I could live with adding a second or so to
   our load, but 6 additional seconds is a deal-breaker.

Does just what I need it to. Sorry to see it close.

   Look, I realize this happens with a thriving open-source ecosystem:
   developers come and go. Plugins are maintained for years, and then
   finally the people who maintain them have to bid adieu. I get it. But
   if someone decides to take FD Feedburner on, I'm prepared to kick in
   coffee money. üôÇ

    2. Unzip the archive
    3. Activate the plugin through the ‚ÄòPlugins‚Äô menu in WordPress

FAQ

     Does this plugin create any new tables?

   No. It uses custom post types and taxonomies.

     None of the details pages are working!

   Please resave your rewrite rules: Settings > Permalinks > Save Changes
   (just click the button)

     I got an error when loading my glossary tips

   It may be a permalink problem. Go to Settings > Permalinks and click
   Save Changes

     It doesn‚Äôt do anything?

   Check if jQuery is loaded.
   For glossary terms only, you have to add the terms (Tooltip Glossary >
   Add New Term) and then use the appropriate TinyMCE button to link the
   text with that glossary term

   Installation Instructions
          Either install through admin panel (this is the eaiest way), or:

Excellent tooltip plugin

   flongpre April 26, 2018
   While looking for a glossary / tooltip plugin in 2016, I found this one
   and I use it on 2 big sites since then. With the WPML compatibility and
   many other improvements, I was always happy to discover new features as
   we use it. The plugin is upgraded frequently and very well maintained
   by Gerkin who was always quick to fix bugs and answer questions in the
   forum.

A free five star plugin!!

   bobby1kenobi December 1, 2017
   To be honest I tried them all to find the best solution and here it is!
   This is the best tooltip plugin. Nice, smooth design, easy to use and
   to setup. Did I forgot something ? Yes- it's totally FREE. Thumbs up!
   üëçüëç

Great plugin, responsive help

   handwovenbox October 23, 2017
   Many thanks for the plugin. It works great and Gerkin has answered my
   questions quickly in the support forums.

Exactly what I was looking for!

   jorgenheld July 22, 2017
   Easy to install and activate. Perfect with the "Advanced attributes"
   button. I didn't realize that the option existed until I read the
   manual üôÇ Just mark the text string (or in my case a link) and click on
   the "Add a Tooltip" button. Add the text you want to appear in the pop
   up window. Done! Excellent work by the plugin developer!

Strange and Useless

   ist4000 November 21, 2016
   No function is working properly. The plugin does random things with no
   evident logical connection between each other. Very strange and
   absolutely useless. No description for shortcodes to try out things.
   Just the not working buttons in the tool panel of the editor.

Plugin with some issues but great active support

   Jos Klever September 3, 2016
   A client asked me to solve some issues on their website. It appeared to
   be impossible to update this plugin from 1.1.6 to 2.x, so I created a
   support ticket. Together we did some research and found a few
   improvements in the update process. During this process some other bugs
   were found and solved pretty quickly. Today with the release of 2.3.2
   every issue we found, is solved, so keep up the good work!

FAQ

   Do I have to install any software on my server to get this working?
          Not at all! Zendesk Chat is a hosted livechat service. Simply
          configure the plugin and you‚Äôre done!

   Which web browsers work best with this plugin
          Though designed to work on most browsers, Zendesk Chat works
          best in the following environment: IE 6 or later (PC), Firefox 2
          or later (Mac, PC, or Linux), Safari 2 or later (Mac), Google
          Chrome (PC, Mac).

   I managed to install the plugin but cannot link up to Zendesk Chat.
          Why?
          The plugin tries to link up with Zendesk Chat by connecting
          using a few approaches including PHP Curl. If the outgoing
          connections are blocked (eg. by a firewall), please request your
          server administrator.

          Alternatively, you can also manually include the script in the
          footer file (‚Äúwp-content/themes/default/footer.php‚Äù in your
          wordpress installation).

   Is it free to use?
          The plugin comes with a free plan specially tailored for
          WordPress users. Power users can purchase upgrade options
          anytime.

   How can I chat with more visitors at the same time?
          You can easily do so by upgrading to a better plan. To find out
          more about the plans and features we offer, please visit
          https://www.zendesk.com/chat/pricing/#pricing

   Its just not working for me! HELP!
          Dont worry!! We are happy to assist! Just come on down to our
          site at https://www.zendesk.com/chat or leave an email for us at
          chat@zendesk.com and we will help you with installation.

   WordPress Integration for Chat accounts
          The integration supports chat phase 4, 3 and 1 accounts. If you
          have a zendesk subdomain, please provide your subdomain as you
          are either chat phase 3 or 4 customer. If you don‚Äôt have a
          subdomain, leave the subdomain field as blank as you are chat
          phase 1 customer.

Reviews

I like Zendesk a lot but WP plugin is disaster

   Marin Stoyanov January 11, 2018
   I thought that installing the plugin made by Zendesk team will be easy
   and i won't face any issues. Instead now I'm here and I write my
   review. WordPress Zendesk plugin is real disaster. It doesn't allow me
   to login to my account. I'm sure that my password and email are
   correct. I tripe-checked them and they are correct but the plugin
   doesn't allow me to login to my existing Zendesk account. Some
   suggestions for the authors: 1) We live in 21st century, logging with
   my real Zendesk username and password is real thread. Instead you can
   use API key, provide temporary access key or use other more intelligent
   way to associate WP website with Zendesk account 2) Most WP plugins,
   that require configuration after being activated, usually have a
   Settings link next to 'Details'. You're huge enough to do it.

Data leaked?

   Phil September 10, 2017
   The Zendesk Chat system itself works quite well, from what little
   chance we had to use it. However, a few months ago we received
   chat/messages from someone else's Zendesk account, which is hugely
   concering. I contacted support but haven't heard anything back in
   weeks. Very worrying! If you communicate any kind of private/sensitive
   data I'd highly recommend avoiding Zendesk Chat, possibly even Zendesk
   itself too since they are closely linked.

Cuidado. Cobran√ßa automatica.

   Rodolfo December 26, 2016
   Cuidado. Instalei o Zopim e paguei por 2 agentes por 6 seis meses. Ap√≥s
   isso o sistema renovou automaticamente, mesmo sem meu site estar no ar
   mais e mesmo sem usar o sistema deles. Entrei em contato e me
   informaram que n√£o devolveriam o dinheiro porque j√° havia passado o
   tempo para reclamar e que isso estava previsto, quando assinei. Tenho
   os e-mails, que compravam isso. Tomem muito cuidado! N√£o recomendo!

Easy and fast

   albaintrade September 22, 2016
   Very good application easy and fast... You can try on my website
   http://almanyayurtdisikargo.com/

nice plugin

   nicopozena79 September 10, 2016
   Pretty good service

I love this program, but it slows my site

   ddrevik September 3, 2016
   I love this plugin. It helps our website visitors tremendously to be
   able to ask questions and interact with us. Many are reluctant to call
   or email for fear of being inundated with sales calls, so this allows
   them to stay at arms reach until they get comfortable with us. Why only
   3 stars then? The speed. When I load the Zopim widget, my homepage load
   time goes from 6.5s to 12.3s. I can't have visitors waiting that long
   for our homepage to load. I could live with adding a second or so to
   our load, but 6 additional seconds is a deal-breaker.

Does just what I need it to. Sorry to see it close.

   Look, I realize this happens with a thriving open-source ecosystem:
   developers come and go. Plugins are maintained for years, and then
   finally the people who maintain them have to bid adieu. I get it. But
   if someone decides to take FD Feedburner on, I'm prepared to kick in
   coffee money. üôÇ

Preserve Image Quality

   in quality. Our servers strip hidden bulky information from your images
   and reduce file size without affecting the appearance.

   IFRAME:
   https://www.youtube.com/embed/BDtgVJZEajg?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide
   =2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent

   Smush meticulously scans every image you upload ‚Äì or have already added
   to your site ‚Äì cuts all the unnecessary data and scales it for you
   before adding it to your media library.

Compress any Image in any Directory

   In addition to smushing your media uploads, you may want to compress
   the images stored in other folders. Smush now lets you compress any
   image in any directory so that you can optimize all the images on your
   site ‚Äì including NextGEN images, images stored on Amazon S3 using WP
   Offload Media and images in EVERY WordPress plugin and theme package!

Fix Your Google PageSpeed Image Opportunites

   Is your Google PageSpeed performance test opportunities telling you to:
     * Defer Offscreen Images
     * Optimize Images
     * Properly Size Images
     * Serve images with correct dimensions
     * Use WebP images
     * Or, Serve Images in Next-Gen Formats

   Smush is the answer with options for automating every aspect of image
   optimization.

Compatible with Your Favorite Media Library Plugins

   No matter what plugins you use to better manage your WordPress media
   library, Smush has you covered. Check out just a few of the plugins
   Smush is working with to help make your site faster and more efficient:
     * WP All Import
     * WP Offload Media
     * WP Media Folder
     * WPBakery Page Builder
     * WP Retina 2x
     * NextGen Gallery
     * WPML
     * WPML Media Translation Add-on
     * Styles
     * And many, many, more!

   Smush now includes a wrong size image finder. Activate, and your images
   will be highlighted with smart tips for scaling your images. Quickly
   locate the images that are keeping you from getting that perfect 100 on
   your Google PageSpeed test.

Defer Offscreen Images

   Smush has lazy load built-in. If your page has a bunch of images below
   the fold, lazy loading will drastically speed up your page by serving
   only the images being viewed and delaying others further down the page.

   ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ

     ‚ÄúI had no idea that my page load time was being dragged down by the
     images. The plugin nearly halved the time it took.‚Äù ‚Äì karlcw

   ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ

     ‚ÄúI optimise my photos in Photoshop, but Smush makes it so easy ‚Äì it
     does it automatically. I can just sit back and enjoy the speed.‚Äù ‚Äì

   ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ

     ‚ÄúSmush helped reduce the total files size on my site and increased
     browsing speed. Well done guys!‚Äù ‚Äì pdci

What about Multisite?

   Smush can be used to optimize all the images across your entire
   network! Use global settings or configure each site individually.

   Smush is super easy to use ‚Äì no confusing compression software
   settings. Smush images in your library one at a time or bulk smush up
   to 50 images at a time. Plus, configure auto-smush to asynchronously
   scale and compress some or all of your images as they are being
   uploaded ‚Äì it‚Äôs incredibly fast.

   The faster your site loads, the more Google, Bing, Yahoo and other
   search engines will like it. Your site will load faster and rank
   higher.

   use. This includes the transfer of EXIF data. The EXIF data will either
   be stripped or returned as it is. It is not stored on the WPMU DEV
   servers.

FAQ

   I just finished running Smush and Google Pagespeed still says my images
          need compressing and resizing. How do I fix it?
          This means your images were not properly scaled for where they
          are being displayed. Scaling images before uploading them can be
          time-consuming but can save space and speedup load time. First,
          determine what size your image needs to be. You can use the
          built-in images size detector included in the free version of
          Smush to find what height and width your image should be. Once
          you know how large the image should be, scale your images to the
          right size.

          Tip: If you‚Äôre having any issues or want to save a tone of time,
          The Smush Pro CDN includes auto resizing.

   Does Smush delete or replace my original full-size images?
          Nope. WordPress crops and resizes every image you upload for
          embedding on your site. By default, Smush only compresses these
          cropped and resized images, not your original full-size images.
          To compress your original full-sized images use Smush Pro.

   What type of file should I use for my images (GIF, PNG, JPG)?
          GIF files are large and can‚Äôt be optimized much. Animated GIFs
          should always be delivered as video files like WebM and MP4.

          PNG is best for computer generated graphics (vectors, logos,
          fonts, etc.), images with few colors or images with
          transparency.

          JPG should be used for photography or images with a lot of color
          variation.

          Tip: The Smush Pro CDN includes next-gen convert to WebP ‚Äì
          sharper images that are 25 to 30 percent smaller than JPEG and
          PNG files.

   I‚Äôm a photographer, can I keep all my EXIF data?
          Yes! EXIF data stores camera settings, focal length, date, time
          and location information in image files. EXIF data makes image
          files larger but if you are a photographer you may want to
          preserve this information. We have included the option to
          preserve EXIF image data in Smush.

   I just ran Bulk Smush and some of my images didn‚Äôt get compressed?
          First, check to see if you‚Äôre receiving any server errors. If
          your images seem to be processing correctly check the file size
          of the images being skipped. Images over 5mb will be skipped. To
          compress images up to 32mb get Smush Pro.

   I activated Smush and I don‚Äôt see any difference in image quality. How
          am I supposed to know if Smush is working?
          Great question! It is important to understand Smush is an
          optimization tool that uses lossless image compression to save
          disk storage space and speed up your site. Smush squeezes data
          from your image files that will save space, resize huge images,
          and improve speed without changing quality.

          You can track file size changes in your media library,
          individual image savings, directory savings, and Smush total
          savings with Smush stats. If you want to see some additional
          magic, run before-and-after page-speed tests with WP Checkup or
          Google PageSpeed Insights. Every little bit of resource savings
          is important when it comes to page-speed!

   Can‚Äôt I just use Photoshop or another image editing application to
          optimize my images?
          Optimizing all the image sizes generated by WordPress, images
          being imported from plugins and themes, and images from other
          web sites is a painful and time-consuming process.

          Smush automatically handles optimizing all your images no matter
          where they come from and can be used as a standalone tool or
          alongside Photoshop.

   Is it optimize or optimise?
          It depends what side of the pond you live on‚Ä¶but whether you say
          optimize, optimise, optimizer or Smush goddess of speed this
          plugin will make sure your images are loading lighting fast.

            plugin one by one while checking Revive Old Posts dashboard to

          should send to social networks.

better not be a waste

   expressionsfromthisjourney August 25, 2019
   I paid money to get features that I can't seem to get access to

Great plugin, great CX

   cbertozz August 15, 2019
   I'm using the plugin to push posts from my site to the LinkedIn company
   page. Works really well. People need to persevere with the setup
   process and they will be rewarded. The support has been fantastic and
   I've been able to help out as part of some trials. Great guys.

Useless logs, so if it‚Äôs not working, good luck

   snailgeek August 11, 2019
   I'm glad it works so well for so many people. But if it doesn't work
   for you straight away, the logs are completely useless, so good luck
   figuring it out. The one error message I came across was nowhere in
   their documentation, and mostly I wasn't getting any errors, just a
   lack of results. Yes, they tell you how to set up a cron if you're not
   seeing posts, but that's not that helpful. I did that, it worked for 24
   hours and then stopped working, and because the logs only record
   successful posts, I have literally no idea why it stopped working. No
   changes were made to the site, so why would it stop working? Attempted
   to get help but if you're using the free version good luck. If it works
   for you out the box, great. If it doesn't, don't waste your time trying
   to troubleshoot - move on! I've put way too many hours into this thing.

Perfect!

   jeffinner07 August 2, 2019
   I was using Buffer ‚Äì HYPESocial but I couldn't exclude some blog posts
   and the customer support was bad. Sometimes they would answer to my
   emails and sometimes they just ignored them. This app is amazing! It
   was easy to set up and my old blog posts get automatically shared to my
   Facebook page without having to use buffer. I had a small glitch when
   setting up the plugin and the developer of the app quickly replied to
   my email and helped me fix the problem. The amazing customer support is
   what makes me want to pay for the pro version.

Macht was es soll

   Ich verzeichne verbesserte Sichtbarkeit in den Suchmaschinen.

They refuse to go back to free version

   mkdot July 2, 2019
   They refuse to let me go back to free version. Once you pay for this
   plugin annually, you have to pay forever until you stop your credit
   card. NEVER UPGRADE TO PAID EDITION!!

P3 (Plugin Performance Profiler)

Description

   This plugin creates a profile of your WordPress site‚Äôs plugins‚Äô
   performance by measuring their impact on your site‚Äôs load time.  Often
   times, WordPress sites load slowly because of poorly configured plugins
   or because there are so many of them. By using the P3 plugin, you can
   narrow down anything causing slowness on your site.

   This plugin uses the canvas element for drawing charts and requires
   requires Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, or IE9 or later. This plugin
   will not work in IE8 or lower.

Screenshots

     * First, profile your site. The scanner generates some traffic on
       your site and monitors your site's performance on the server, then
       shows you the results. With this information, you can decide what
       action to take.
     * After profiling, you'll see a breakdown of relative runtime for
       each plugin.
     * Callouts at the top give you quick information like how much load
       time (in seconds) is dedicated to plugins and how many database
       queries your site is running per page.
     * The detailed timeline gives you timing information for every
       plugin, the theme, and the core for every page during the profile.
       Find out exactly what's happening on slow loading pages.
     * You can toggle each series on and off to customize this timeline
       for your precise needs.
     * The query timeline gives you the number of database queries for
       every page during the profile. Find out which pages generate the
       most database queries.
     * Keep a history of your performance scans, compare your current
       performance with your previous performance.
     * Full in-app help documentation
     * Send a summary of your performance profile via e-mail. If you want
       to show your developer, site admin, hosting support, or a plugin
       developer what's going on with your site, this is good way to start
       the conversation.
     * Use the advanced settings to activate debug mode, control cache
       busting, or lock down profiling to a set of IP addresses.
     * View the debug log on the help page to help troubleshoot if P3
       isn't recording properly.

FAQ

   Installation Instructions
          Automatic installation

         1. Log into your WordPress admin
         2. Click Plugins
         3. Click Add New
         4. Search for P3
         5. Click Install Now under ‚ÄúP3 (Plugin Performance Profiler)‚Äù
         6. Activate the plugin

          Manual installation:

         1. Download the plugin
         2. Extract the contents of the zip file
         3. Upload the contents of the zip file to the wp-content/plugins/
            folder of your WordPress installation
         4. Then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.

   I installed P3, what now?
          Open the Tools menu, then open P3 Plugin Profiler then click
          Scan Now.

   What if I get a warning about usort()?
          Warning messages like this: Warning: usort() [function.usort]:
          Array was modified by the user comparison function are due to a
          known php bug. See php bug #50688 for more information. This
          warning does not affect the functionality of your site and it is
          not visible to your users.

   In the e-mail report, why is my theme detected as ‚Äúunknown?‚Äù
          Previous version of the plugin (before 1.1.0) did not have theme
          name detection support. If you performed a scan with a previous
          version, then upgraded to 1.1.0+ to view the scan, the theme
          name will show as ‚Äúunknown.‚Äù

   Help! I used P3 and now my site is down!
          First, get your site back up! There are two ways to do this. Try
          the emergency shutoff switch first. If that doesn‚Äôt work, delete
          the plugin files.

          Emergency Shutoff Switch

         1. Visit yoursite.com/wordpress/index.php?P3_SHUTOFF=1

          Delete the Plugin Files

         1. Delete wp-content/plugins/p3-profiler (the whole folder)
         2. Delete wp-content/mu-plugins/p3-profiler.php (if it exists)

          This can happen if P3 hits the memory limit on your server while
          it‚Äôs running. This happens most often on sites with many active
          plugins or a complex theme. Consider switching to the Twenty
          Eleven theme or deactivating a few plugins before re-running P3.

   I get ‚ÄúWarning: file_put_contents( ‚Ä¶. )‚Äù
          Please check your media settings. This is in Settings -> Media
          -> Store uploads in this folder. If this folder is not set
          correctly, P3 won‚Äôt know where to read the files.

   How do I use P3 with multisite?
          P3 is available on the Tools menu for each site in the network.

   How can I change the list of pages scanned with auto-scan?
          You can write a plugin to hook the p3_automatic_scan_urls
          filter. Here‚Äôs some sample code:

function my_p3_auto_scan_pages() {
    return array(
        'http://example.com/',
        'http://example.com/some-cool-post',
        'http://example.com/wp-admin/edit.php',
    );
}
add_filter( 'p3_automatic_scan_urls', 'my_p3_auto_scan_pages' );

Reviews

Productivity suffers trying out stuff like this

   zondar July 18, 2019
   Wouldn't you think that after all these bum reviews, it would have been
   fixed or deleted? All that shows up is a meaningless indicator for this
   plugin. A waste of time - and potential for newbies to krang their site
   trying to make it work.

Don‚Äôt waste your time‚Ä¶

   Exo July 12, 2019
   ... it fails, it's broken. No results, wasted my time and wish I'd
   noticed all other other reviews saying the same before I tried.

Doesn‚Äôt work anymore

   dock3r May 17, 2019
   Doesn't work anymore

Abandonware

   criticaltinkerer May 14, 2019
   The only plugin this plugin monitors is itself. No other plugins appear
   in the results. Checking the support threads it appears that this might
   be a PHP 7 compatibility issue. Since this plugin hasn't been updates
   in the last 3 revisions to WP I can only assume this project has been
   abandoned. A shame actually because so many good reviews in the past.

Doesn‚Äôt work at all:(

   p2hklipureja March 12, 2019
   Only thing it measures is itself. Just like if my site has olny on
   plugin P3 and nothing else. üôÅ

Bad

   Kousekmusic March 2, 2019
   When I start scan, WP the system has fallen. I hope i will fix it..

Don‚Äôt risk your backups on anything less

   Your WordPress backups are worth the entire investment you‚Äôve made in
   your website. The day may come when you get hacked, when something goes
   wrong with an update, your server crashes or your hosting company goes
   bust ‚Äì without good backups, you lose everything. Would you entrust all
   your hard work to a backup plugin with only a few thousand downloads,
   mixed reviews or no professional support?

   Believe us: writing a reliable backup plugin that works consistently
   across the huge range of WordPress deployments is hard.

   UpdraftPlus works. We‚Äôll keep your backups safe.

Why you should backup your website.

   WordPress like any CMS can be vulnerable to things such as server
   crashes, hacking, security flaws, bad plugin or theme updates and
   insecure web hosts. If anything happened to your website, it would cost
   you dearly in time, money and reputation.

   Whilst other security measures are essential, backups are the ultimate
   insurance: they mean that, if the worst were to happen, your website
   (plus all related files and databases) stay safe, and can be restored
   in no time.

   You could always create your own manual backups- but using backup
   plugin is infinitely quicker, simpler and safer. Life‚Äôs busy enough!
   With UpdraftPlus, you can simply ‚Äúset and forget‚Äù, scheduling in
   automatic backups to save you time, work and hassle.

How UpdraftPlus compares with other backup plugins:

   UpdraftPlus is the most highly-rated and popular plugin out there ‚Äì and
   for good reason. Not only is it comprehensive in terms of its features,
   but it‚Äôs aso easy and intuitive to use. And because it has such a vast
   user base, it‚Äôs tried and tested in a whole range of different
   situations and scenarios.

   Unlike many other plugins, UpdraftPlus:
     * Restores, as well as backing up
     * Backs up to more cloud options than any others
     * Allows you to set up automatic backup schedules, for the ultimate
       in convenience
     * Is faster, using up fewer server resources
     * Has been tested on over 1 million sites

   On our website, we‚Äôve got a whole page dedicated to how our Premium
   version compares with the competition here

Managing multiple website backups

Instantly create a temporary clone of your site (UpdraftClone)

   A temporary clone is an instant copy of this website, running on our
   servers. You don‚Äôt need to test or develop on your live site; instead,
   you can UpdraftClone it, and throw away your clone when done. Learn
   more about UpdraftClone here.
     * Easy: Press the buttons‚Ä¶ UpdraftClone does the work.
     * Reliable: Runs on capacity from a leading cloud computing provider.
     * Secure: One VPS (Virtual Private Server) per clone, shared with
       nobody.
     * Fast: Takes just the time needed to create a backup and send it.
     * Flexible: If you want, test upgrading to a different PHP or WP
       version.

   To create a temporary clone you need: 1) credit in your account and 2)
   to connect to your account. You can buy UpdraftClone tokens from our
   shop, here.

Are you multi-lingual? Can you translate?

   Are you able to translate UpdraftPlus into another language? Are you
   ready to help speakers of your language? UpdraftPlus Backup/Restore
   itself is ready and waiting ‚Äì the only work needed is the translating.
   The translation process is easy, and web-based ‚Äì go here for
   instructions: https://updraftplus.com/translate/. (Or if you‚Äôre an
   expert WordPress translator already, then just pick out the .pot file
   from the wp-content/plugins/updraftplus/languages/ directory ‚Äì if you
   scan for translatable strings manually, then you need to get these
   functions: _x(), __(), _e(), _ex(), log_e()).

   Many thanks to the existing translators ‚Äì listed at:

   Where are your other FAQs, other than the few found here?
          Here: https://updraftplus.com/faqs/ (by keeping them in one
          place, we make sure they don‚Äôt fall out-of-date!).

   Is there any way to make managing multiple website backups easier?
          Yes! We‚Äôve developed a brilliant new plugin that allows you to
          backup, update and manage all of your website remotely from one
          central location. It‚Äôs called UpdraftCentral, and it comes in 2
          different forms:

          + UpdraftCentral (free, self-hosted)
          + UpdraftCentral Premium (fully-hosted by us and ‚Äúready-to-go‚Äù;
            self-hosted version also available)

   What if I have a problem / need support ?
          You can find us in the WordPress support forum for this plugin.
          However, before you get in touch with problems, please do ensure
          that you read through all the FAQs and that you‚Äôve updated to
          the latest release of our plugin. If you‚Äôre a paying customer,
          you should go to our support page, here.

          It helps greatly if you can include the backup log and as much
          other information as possible in your report, for example, the
          PHP version, your website, the error description, how you got to
          the page that caused it, any other relevant plugins you have
          installed, plus any other information that might be of use.

          To find the backup log: there are links to download the logs on
          the UpdraftPlus settings page- or you may be emailed it. Failing
          that, FTP into the directory wp-content/updraft and look for it
          there.

          If you know how, please send your PHP error logs- just the few
          lines that appear when you run a backup, often the file called
          error_log, possibly in your wp-admin directory which you can
          check via FTP. And if you‚Äôre a programmer that can debug and
          send a patch, that‚Äôs even better.

   UpdraftPlus runs out of time when it‚Äôs trying to backup, after I have
          left it for some time to give it a good chance. What can I do?
          This problem is probably caused by your account being starved of
          resources by your (cheap) web host provider. This is far from
          ideal; although UpdraftPlus supports resuming backup runs right
          from the beginning to avoid everything having to be done at
          once, it has its limits. The best thing is to choose a more
          reputable web host. Failing this, try going into the ‚ÄúExpert
          settings‚Äù and reducing the size at which zip files are split.
          UpdraftPlus is known to successfully backup websites that run
          into the multiple-gigabytes on web servers that are not
          resource-starved.

   If my site gets hacked and the backups don‚Äôt work, is there anything I
          can do?
          Unfortunately not; since this is free software, there‚Äôs no
          warranty and no guarantee. It‚Äôs up to you to verify that
          UpdraftPlus is creating your backups correctly.

   Have used this plugin for years on our internal and client sites. It
   only gets better, and the tech support when needed is responsive and
   helpful - doesn't just send cut-and-paste answers that ignore your
   original question.

Outstanding!

1.16.16 ‚Äì 23/Jul/2019

       on newer WP versions
     * FIX: Issue where (rare) foreign key constraints aren‚Äôt updated upon
       restore when table prefix changes
     * FIX: Improve parsing of backed-up triggers when restoring
       preventing possible unnecessary errors

       and try again
     * FIX: JSON-reparser to prevent unwanted RINFO data being output to
       screen

       fail
     * TWEAK: In cases where there were duplicate Google Drive folders
       (which is possible if there are multiple network communications

       merged automatically
     * TWEAK: Add option to start 250GB Vault subscription as in-app
       purchase

     * FEATURE: Added the ability to use already existing local backups

     * FIX: Fix incorrect refusal to accept valid email addresses in the
       UpdraftCentral wizard
     * TRANSLATION: The Italian translation is now complete and supplied
       from wordpress.org, so can be removed from the free plugin zip

       you want to improve UpdraftPlus, take a look at:
       https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/updraftplus).

       without a name header
     * TWEAK: Prevent PHP log notice when fetching available theme updates

     * TWEAK: Abstract the code for handling maintenance mode to allow
       future improvements
     * TWEAK: Fix a potential wrong file path in an error message
     * TWEAK: If there is more than one Google Drive folder of the same

     * TWEAK: Infer phpseclib class path from the class name, instead of
       hard-coding it
     * TWEAK: Some lines that were meant to include HTML bold in the

       user enables the ‚ÄòAdd this website to UpdraftCentral‚Äô option in the
       Premium/Extensions tab
     * TWEAK: During a restore send structured data to the front end. This

     * TWEAK: Add a timeout on Dropbox quota look-up operations during
       backup, in response to cases of faulty outgoing HTTP proxies
     * TWEAK: The backup_finish() method should not have been private;

       is not English and you want to improve UpdraftPlus, take a look at:
       https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/updraftplus).
     * TWEAK: Ride a polling status check on the regular heartbeat check,
       thereby reducing the need for stand-alone polls
     * TWEAK: If FTP settings were removed and an attempt was made to
       download a backup, then a zero-sized file would be created and then
       an unclear error shown, instead of just showing a clear error.
     * TWEAK: For premium users: Added the option to connect to
       UpdraftCentral Cloud at point of connecting a license to a site
     * TWEAK: If on PHP 5.3 or later, then register our Google SPL
       auto-loader with the ‚Äòprepend‚Äô flag, so that we can avoid loading
       incompatible Google SDKs registered (but not yet used) by other
       components

       destination without any settings

       Azure modules

       a new 5GB 1 month trial, directly from the UpdraftVault settings

       directory is then, where relevant, UpdraftPlus will automatically
       try to create the missing directory

       credentials if needing the WP_Filesystem API to delete old
       directories

       sent about them
     * FIX: If a very large UpdraftVault upload took more than an hour,
       then the token could expire without being refreshed (fix in version
       1.16.0 was incomplete)
     * PERFORMANCE: Modify a condition in the zip-batching algorithm so
       that greater acceleration in the zip-batching algorithm is allowed
       on setups allowing very long PHP run times on the initial
       (zero-eth) resumption
     * PERFORMANCE: UpdraftClone now sends larger chunks over the network,
       leading to faster sending of data
     * PERFORMANCE: Force UpdraftClone to use a 100MB split size for
       better performance (previously intended, but not always working)
     * TWEAK: Upon restoration, WP‚Äôs cache directory will be emptied (by
       default it is not included in backups, so in theory this is a
       no-op, but the occasional case has been seen where it got populated
       during the restore process)

       the ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù feature can now resume not just at the most recent
       zip file, but within the zip file at the point it had reached
       (https://updraftplus.com/auto-resuming-interrupted-restores-part-2/
       )
     * FEATURE: Added command in WP-CLI which gives a list of incremental
       backups restore points.
     * FIX: Regression: When a Dropbox upload failed to complete,
       UpdraftPlus would log this but fail to retry
     * FIX: Again update phpseclib to the latest version which should now

       message

1.16.4 ‚Äì 17/Jan/2019

     * FIX: Regression: Properly mark backups picked up via ‚ÄúRescan remote

     * FIX: Correctly update the OneDrive refresh token to prevent expiry
     * FIX: Again work around an issue with ‚ÄòSSH2 Server Host Key
       Algorithm Mismatch‚Äô occurring with the current phpseclib release by

       on all installs
     * FIX: When restoring an incremental backup set via WP-CLI, the
       selected restore point was ignored
     * FIX: If the remote storage settings were for multiple instances of
       a single backend-type (e.g. two Dropbox accounts), and if the
       entire backup and send operation completed in a single PHP process,
       then the local copy of the files would not be deleted
     * TWEAK: Show the error message if mbstring.func_overload is turned
       on in php.ini while creating migration key
     * TWEAK: Added Azure China endpoint

     * FIX: Prevent the incremental backup cron from being incorrectly
       scheduled

1.16.2 ‚Äì 07/Jan/2019

       (regression in 1.16.1, which was never released on wordpress.org)

       work around to fix the ‚ÄòSSH2 Server Host Key Algorithm Mismatch‚Äô
       issue

       improvements
     * TWEAK: Re-factoring of the restore routines to share more code
       between different entry points, and allow future improvements

       queries (previously one for each backup) when loading the settings
       page
     * TWEAK: internal backup extradata parameter to prevent unwanted PHP

       deleted after 40 days. (Since they are attached to email reports,
       you can keep and retrieve them from those if needed). Over-ride
       this with the filter updraftplus_log_delete_age if desired.

     * TWEAK: Include the backup set ID in clone ready state file
     * TWEAK: For Premium users with grand-fathered lifetime updates (i.e.

     * TWEAK: For Premium users with who have downgraded from unlimited
       licences to another package, a licence expiry message could show

       function updraft_backupnow_inpage_go()
     * TWEAK: General code tidy-up, making older code conform to our
       current standards
     * TWEAK: Add the possibility of passing back associated data with
       test results, and log it in the browser console
     * TWEAK: When carrying out a remote storage test, pass the state of
       the ‚Äòdebug‚Äô setting
     * TWEAK: When testing SFTP settings, if debug is activated, activate
       debug logging and pass the results back in the event of test
       failure
     * TWEAK: Optimise away a database query in the case of no
       UpdraftCentral keys existing
     * TWEAK: Removed ‚ÄúReduced Redundancy‚Äù storage class from Amazon S3
       remote storage options, because Amazon are deprecating it (and it
       now costs more, for inferior redundancy ‚Äì
       https://updraftplus.com/forums/topic/amazon-is-phasing-out-reduced-
       redundancy-storage/)
     * TWEAK: Backup files missing error message corrected
     * TWEAK: Add the handlebars-js and xamin/handlebars.php libraries
     * TWEAK: The FTP storage module has been ported to outputing its
       configuration via a template
     * TWEAK: Introduce internal API and port all job data saved in
       storage modules to be instance-local

1.13.5 ‚Äì 08/Aug/2017

     * TWEAK: Manage phpseclib through composer
     * TWEAK: Do less logging to database when resuming and noticing
       already-processed tables (saves resources)
     * TWEAK: Returns comment status when updating comments from
       UpdraftCentral
     * TWEAK: Update plugin-updates-checker library to current (4.2), and
       manage via composer, replacing bundled copy in the build source
     * TWEAK: Replace uses of create_function(), which is deprecated on
       PHP 7.2
     * TWEAK: Replace deprecated constructors (PHP 7+) in webdav module
     * TWEAK: Documentation showing plugin developers how easy it is to
       add in-page backups to their plugin:
       https://updraftplus.com/add-take-backup-functionality-plugin/
     * TWEAK: Make the UpdraftCentral updates checking able to cope with a
       wider range of third-party schemes
     * TWEAK: General code tidy-up, making older code conform to our
       current standards
     * TWEAK: Minor version updates of some bundled libraries
     * TWEAK: Produce and use minified resources (CSS/JS) where available
     * TWEAK: Update class-udrpc to latest (1.4.14) which removes a
       conflict with other code that may interact with CORS OPTIONS
       requests
     * TWEAK: Escape log lines when sending for display (theoretically an
       XSS security issue, but to achieve a successful attack, someone
       would have to first get something malicious into the log file,
       which is difficult as there are not many places where foreign input
       can end up in the log file ‚Äì e.g. hack into Dropbox and cause
       Dropbox to send you back malicious HTML in an error message ‚Äì and
       then be able to persuade you to both take a backup triggering the
       problem and then view the log file in your WP dashboard)
     * TWEAK: Update Google Cloud bucket locations

1.13.4 ‚Äì 08/Jun/2017

     * FIX: Import function had a regression and was not coping with all
       formats
     * TWEAK: When the import function failed, the error was not shown to
       the user

1.13.3 ‚Äì 07/Jun/2017

     * FIX: Revert Dropbox authentication change in 1.13.2, which was not
       working on all sites

1.13.2 ‚Äì 07/Jun/2017

     * TWEAK: Marked as tested and compatible on WordPress 4.8
     * TWEAK: Dropbox authentication flow can now use POST for the final
       step, side-stepping (arbitrary) parameter length restrictions on
       some Apache mod_security setups
     * TWEAK: Prevent a possible PHP notice when curl is not present
     * TWEAK: Point Clef users towards Keyy
     * TWEAK: Do not open an alert box when the user changes their site ID
       in ‚ÄòAdvanced Tools‚Äô
     * TWEAK: Fix parameters to updraft_check_overduecrons() JS function

1.13.1 ‚Äì 09/May/2017

     * REFACTOR: Completed re-factoring of the remote storage modules, so
       that now all remote storage code has completed this current stage
       of re-factoring (more to come in future ‚Äì laying the foundation for
       a significant new feature)
     * FIX: Added a nonce to the Dropbox deauth link. This is a minor
       security issue ‚Äì someone personally targetting you, who knew that
       you were logged in to your WordPress admin, and who could persuade
       you to visit a personally-crafted web page, could cause the
       connection between UpdraftPlus and your Dropbox to be broken. The
       only impact of this is that the sending of your next backup to
       Dropbox would fail, and you would be alerted about the need to
       re-connect.
     * FIX: Import settings now handle the new remote storage options
       format
     * FIX: The zip file browser was not working in free versions
     * TWEAK: Added a version check when saving settings to prevent errors
       or lost settings
     * TWEAK: ‚ÄòExisting Backups‚Äô table now shows an icon for each remote
       destination that the backup was sent to
     * TWEAK: Update SSL CA certificates file
     * TWEAK: If, when uploading to S3, a file is not found, handle it
       slightly more elegantly
     * TWEAK: Work with some WebDAV servers that previously sent empty
       responses to OPTIONS requests

1.12.40 ‚Äì 01/Apr/2017

     * TWEAK: The in-page log file display had stopped continuously
       updating in 1.12.32
     * FIX: In some circumstances, settings for the storage modules
       refactored in 1.12.37 could fail to show
     * FIX: The free version of 1.12.37/38 in some circumstances could
       fail to complete Dropbox authentication

1.12.38 ‚Äì 31/Mar/2017

     * TWEAK: Dropbox API v2 call to de-authorise a token was failing
     * FIX: Prevent a fatal error when attempting to use a backup method
       with no options set

1.12.37 ‚Äì 31/Mar/2017

     * FEATURE: Browse the contents of a backup from within your WordPress
       dashboard, and (with Premium) download individual files from it
     * FIX: Fix an issue that could occasionally cause corruption of
       interrupted Dropbox backups. All Dropbox users are recommended to
       update asap.
     * TWEAK: Remove debugging statement inadvertently left in 1.12.36
     * TWEAK: Re-factored remote storage handlers via add-ons so that
       there was a cleaner and more consistent class hierarchy
       (preparation for future improvements). N.B. If you subsequently
       downgrade to an older version of UpdraftPlus, you will need to
       re-enter the settings for some remote storage options.
     * TWEAK: List of checksum algorithms run over backups and logged now
       includes SHA256, and is filterable (SHA1 now considered deprecated)
     * TWEAK: Allow chunked database encryption to try and resume in the
       event of an error
     * TWEAK: Improve the premium/extension tab content
     * TWEAK: Fix an issue whereby the UpdraftVault settings section could
       show a bogus problem with checking quota immediately after initial
       setup
     * TWEAK: When requesting a download, work around buggy browser/server
       that continued after Connection: close
     * TWEAK: Improve the UI experience when downloading a log file for
       display fails
     * TWEAK: Prevent PHP notice if another plugin cancels a cron event
     * TWEAK: Tweak semaphore handling and enhance logging

   Older changes are found in the changelog.txt file in the plugin
   directory.

   and disclosing an issue where path traversal can lead to remote code
   execution. Simon has done a great deal of work on the WordPress [‚Ä¶]
