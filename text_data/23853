              [Data-Subject-Request-Button-e1546929831741.png]

   “us”, or “our”) value the privacy of the persons (“you” or “your”)
   whose information we collect or receive. This privacy notice (“Notice“)
   explains who we are, how we collect, use and share personal information
   about you, and how you can exercise your privacy rights.

   The Notice covers personal information we collect:

   a) When providing information to the Bombora hosted platform and
   related analytics products, including Company Surge® Analytics ,
   Audience Solutions and Visitor Insights (the “Services“) (see ‘privacy
   for our services’).

   b) When you visit one of our corporate websites (such as
   https://bombora.com/) (“Website“) and/or over the usual course of our
   business practices, such as in connection with our events, sales and
   marketing activities (see ‘privacy for our websites’).

   We recommend that you read this Notice completely to ensure you are
   fully informed. However, to make it easier for you to review those
   parts of this Notice which apply to you, we have divided up the
   document into the following sections:

   1. Who we are

   2. Privacy for our services

   3. Privacy for our websites

   4. General information

   5. Data subject request form

1. Who we are

   Bombora provides a hosted platform and related analytics products
   including Company Surge® Analytics , Audience Solutions and Visitor
   Insights (the “Services“) to publishers, agencies and marketers (our
   “Clients“). Through the services, Bombora provides business-to-business
   demographic, firmographic and Intent data to our Clients to help them
   better connect and target organizations they want to reach (we refer to
   the individuals in those organizations as “End Users“).

   Bombora and its partners engage in tracking End Users’ interactions
   with business-to-business content across various digital properties
   like web registration forms, widgets, websites and webpages (whether
   accesses via computer, mobile or tablet device or other technologies)
   (“Digital Properties“). We than take this data and aggregate the
   information collected into demographic segments, such as company
   revenue and size, functional area, industry, professional group, and
   seniority. This helps Clients customize engagement based on topics that
   organizations are interested in and the intensity of that consumption.

   Bombora is headquartered in New York, NY ,U.S.A. Find out more about us
   and our services.

2. Privacy for our services

   This section describes how we collect and use information we receive or
   collect from End Users through the Services (we refer to this
   collectively as “Service Information“). This includes details about the
   type of information we collect automatically, the types of information
   we receive from other sources and the purposes of those collections.

2.1 What information do we collect and why?

   Information we collect automatically
   We use and deploy various cookies and similar tracking technologies
   (see ‘cookies and similar technologies’ ) to automatically collect
   certain information about your device when you interact with Digital
   Properties that use our technology. Some of this information,
   including your IP address and certain unique identifiers, may identify
   a particular computer or device and may be considered “personal data”
   in certain jurisdictions including in the European Economic Area
   (“EEA“). However, Bombora does not collect any information that enables
   us to identify you personally such as your name, mailing address or
   email address.

   We collect this information by assigning a random unique identifier
   (“UID“) to your device the first time you interact with a
   Digital Property that uses our technology. This UID is then used to
   associate you with information we collect about you.

   The information we automatically collect may include:
     * Information about your device such as the type, model,
       manufacturer, operating system (e.g. iOS, Android), carrier name,
       time zone, network connection type (e.g. Wi-Fi, cellular), IP
       address and unique identifiers assigned to your device such as its
       iOS Identifier for Advertising (IDFA) or Android Advertising ID
       (AAID or GAID).
     * Information about your online behavior such as information about
       the activities or actions you take on Digital Properties we work
       with. This may include time spent on a web page, whether you scroll
       or click on an ad or a web page, session start/stop time, time
       zone, your referring website address, and geo-location (including
       city, country, zip code and potentially geographic co-ordinates if
       you have enabled location services on your device) pages and times
       visited.
     * Information about ads served, viewed, or clicked on such as the
       type of ad, where the ad was served, whether you clicked on it and
       the number of times you have seen the ad.

   Information we receive from other sources
   We may also combine, merge, and/or enhance the information we collect
   about you. This can include the information we collect about you
   with information collected from third parties such as other web-based
   and mobile networks, exchanges and websites (“Partners“) or our Clients
   (for example, they may upload certain “offline” data into the
   Services). View a list of our current partners. In addition, the
   Service Information we automatically collect may be combined and
   associated with business profile information that we infer about you.

   This information may include hashed identifiers derived from other
   information such as email addresses, mobile device IDs, demographic or
   interest data (like your industry, employer, company size, job title or
   department) and content viewed or actions taken on a Digital Property.

   We use the Services Information as follows:
     * To provide the services to our Clients. Generally we use the
       Service Information to help Clients better understand their current
       and prospective customers and market trends. This enables Clients
       to better target and customize websites, content, other general
       marketing efforts and to measure and optimize the performance of
       their marketing.
     * To build various inferenced data segments (“Data Segments”). We may
       use the Service Information to build Data Segments related to, for
       instance, the industry you are in or the type of content you or the
       organization you work for appear to be interested in. We use
       these Data Segments to help our Clients understand their own
       customers, evaluate customer and market trends and create reports
       and scoring regarding their customer’s behavior. The Data Segments
       also may be associated with UIDs, cookies and/or mobile device
       advertising IDs.
     * To do “interest-based advertising”. We sometimes use or work with
       Clients and Partners that use UIDs or other information derived
       from information such as email hashes. This information in turn may
       be associated with cookies and may be used to target ads to you
       that are based on “offline” interest-based segments – such as your
       interests, transactions or demographic information – or used by
       Clients that target and analyze such ads. This is often known as
       “interest-based advertising.” You can find out more about this type
       of advertising at the DAA’s website.
     * To do cross-device tracking. We (or our Partners and Clients we
       work with) may use the Service Information (e.g. the IP addresses
       and UIDs) to try to locate the same unique users across multiple
       browsers or devices (e.g. smartphones, tablets or other devices),
       or work with providers that do this in order to better target ad
       campaigns to common sets of End Users. For example, a brand may
       wish to target customers that it usually recognizes on web browsers
       through mobile apps.
     * To do “user matching”. We (or our Partners) may use the Services
       Information, in particular various UIDs, to sync cookies and other
       identifiers with other Partners and Clients (i.e. to do “user
       matching“). For example, in addition to the UID’s an End User has
       been assigned in our system, we may also receive a list of UIDs our
       Partners or Clients have assigned to an End User. When we identify
       matches, we then let our Clients and Partners know in order to help
       them do any of the above, including enhancing their own data and
       Data Segments, to do interest-based advertising or provide insights
       to other customers. For instance, we use Facebook Custom Audiences
       to do user matching
     * As we believe to be necessary or appropriate:
       a) under applicable law including laws outside your country of
       residence
       b) to comply with legal processes
       c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities
       including authorities outside your country of residence
       d) to enforce our terms and conditions
       e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates
       f) to protect yours, our affiliates and/or our rights, privacy,
       safety or property
       g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages
       that we may sustain.
     * To evaluate, operate or improve the Services.

2.2 Cookies and similar technologies

   Our Partners, our Clients and we use various UIDs, cookies and similar
   tracking technologies to automatically collect information from End
   Users across various Digital Properties (as previously described
   above). Please review our Cookie Statement for further information.

   2.3 Legal basis for processing personal information (EEA residents
   only)

   If you are an individual from the EEA, our legal basis for collecting
   and using personal information described above will depend on the
   personal information concerned and the specific context in which we
   collect it. However, we normally rely on our legitimate interests to
   collect personal information from you, except where such interests are
   overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and
   freedoms. Where we rely on our legitimate interests to process your
   personal information, they include the interests described in the ‘what
   information do we collect and why’ section above.

   In some cases, we may rely on our consent or have a legal obligation to
   collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the
   personal information to protect your vital interests or those of
   another person. If we rely on consent to collect and/or process your
   personal information, we will obtain such consent in compliance with
   applicable laws.

   If you have questions about or need further information concerning the
   legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information,
   please contact us using the contact details provided under the ‘contact
   us section below.

   Bombora takes precautions to protect data and information under its
   control from misuse, loss or alteration. Bombora has put in place
   appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the
   information it collects through its Services and Websites. Bombora’s
   security measures include technology and equipment to help protect our
   information, and Bombora maintains security measures regarding who may
   and may not access our information. Of course, no system or network can
   ensure or guarantee complete security, and Bombora disclaims
   any liability resulting from use of the Service or from third party
   hacking events or intrusions.

4.6 Children

   Our Websites and Services are not intended for children under 13 years
   old. If you are aware of personal information we have collected from a
   child under 13, we ask that you ‘contact us’ located in the below
   section.

4.7 Other websites

   The Services or Websites may contain links to or integrations with
   other sites that Bombora does not own or operate. This includes links
   from Clients and Partners that may use the Bombora logo in a
   co-branding agreement, or websites and web services that we work with
   in order to provide the Services. For example, we might sponsor an
   event, or provide services in conjunction with other businesses.
   Bombora does not control, is not responsible for these parties’ sites,
   services, content, products, services, privacy policies or practices.

   Likewise, if you permit Service Information to be collected and used
   through a website using the Services, you are choosing to disclose
   information to both Bombora and the third party with whose brand the
   website is associated. This Privacy Notice only governs Bombora’s use
   of your Service Information not the use of any information by any other
   party.

4.8 International data transfers

   Our servers and facilities that maintain our Websites, Services and the
   information we collect are operated in the United States. With that
   said, we are an international business, and our use of your information
   necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international
   basis. If you are located in the European Union, Canada or elsewhere
   outside of the United States, please be aware that information we
   collect may be transferred to and processed in the United States and
   other applicable territories in which the privacy laws may not be as
   comprehensive as or equivalent to those in the country where you reside
   and/or are a citizen.

   However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your
   personal information will remain protected in accordance with this
   Notice. This includes implementing the European Commission’s Standard
   Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our
   group companies, which require all group companies to protect personal
   information they process from the EEA in accordance with European Union
   data protection law. Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided
   upon request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with
   our third party service providers and partners and further details can
   be provided upon request.

4.9 Data retention and deletion

   We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an
   ongoing legitimate business need to do so (e.g. to comply with
   applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements, to enforce
   our agreements or comply with our legal obligations).

   When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
   personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it. If this is
   not possible (e.g. because your personal information has been stored in
   backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information
   and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

4.10 Changes to our Privacy Notice

   We may revise this Privacy Notice from time to time to reflect changes
   in our practices or in the applicable law. When such changes are
   material in nature we will notify you either by prominently posting
   a notice of such changes prior to implementing them or by directly
   sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this Privacy
   Notice periodically. We will always show the date of the latest
   modification date of the Privacy Notice at the top of the page so you
   can tell when it has last been revised.

Will you help make marketing sustainable?

   With consumers inundated with ads and emails… it’s time for marketing
   to have a sustainability movement.

   Sustainable Marketing is about conservation and making conscious
   decisions based on an understanding of their true costs.

   It’s about fewer ads, emails and sales calls, done more selectively and
   effectively.

Unlock Intent insights of your buyer's journey

   Today’s buyers control their own journeys. By the time they interact
   with a sales rep, they’re already in the late stages of the buying
   process.

   Historical Buyer Journey Analysis retrospectively analyzes Intent topic
   consumption over 18 months. This analysis delivers a deep-dive into the
   intuitive and non-intuitive Intent topics that are most meaningful to
   your target customers at different buying stages.

   Combined with Company Surge^® Analytics, insights from your analysis
   can be used to power intent based sales and marketing programs.
