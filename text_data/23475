   Hi everyone, happy Monday! I am not ready for the week even after a
   4-day weekend. My weekend was long, fun and so relaxing.

   I wore this out on 4th of July. Kate Spade tee, striped shorts and horn
   necklace, Anthro shades.

   and this was my 4th of July dinner from Rocco‚Äôs Tacos.

   I changed into these chiffon printed shorts and v-neck tee, along with
   comfy wedges to walk in.

   I made egg Benedicts with sweet potatoes for breakfast, I pretty sure I
   gain 5 pounds this past weekend.

   These accessories have been on repeat since I‚Äôve gotten them. (shades /
   turquoise bracelet / gold rope bracelet / horn necklace / pave necklace
   / envelop clutch-on sale for $39)
   Accessories Accessories

   Love this GAP tee so much and decided to do a little print mixing with
   a striped skirt, avis, double strand necklace and these sandals are so
   comfortable.

   puffs at least these are organic.

   Found a new way to organized my bracelets, everything is visible. This
   organizer is from the container store.
