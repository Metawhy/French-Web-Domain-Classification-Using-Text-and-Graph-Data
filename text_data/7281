Flick Chicks

A guide to women in the movies.

   A few years ago, I sat down for a meeting with some executives at a
   movie studio that I will call Thinkscope Visioncloud. Thinkscope
   Visioncloud had put out several of my favorite movies, and they wanted
   to see if I had any feature ideas. I was very excited. I have a great
   job writing for “The Office,” but, really, all television writers do is
   dream of one day writing movies. I’ll put it this way: At the Oscars
   the most famous person in the room is, like, Angelina Jolie. At the
   Emmys the huge exciting celebrity is Bethenny Frankel. You get what I
   mean. It’s snobby and grossly aspirational, but it’s true.

   The junior executives’ office at Thinkscope Visioncloud was nicer than
   any room within a fifty-mile radius of the “Office” studio. After I
   finished pitching one of my ideas for a low-budget romantic comedy, I
   was met with silence. One of the execs sheepishly looked at the other
   execs. He finally said, “Yeah, but we’re really trying to focus on
   movies about board games. People really seem to respond to those.”

   For the rest of the meeting, we talked about whether there was any
   potential in a movie called “Yahtzee!” I made some polite suggestions
   and left.

   I am always surprised at what movie studios think people will want to
   see. I’m even more surprised at how often they are correct. Based on
   what I’ve learned from my time in Hollywood, the following titles are
   my best guess as to what may soon be coming to a theatre near you:

   “Bananagrams 3D”

   “Apples to Apples 4D” (The audience is pummelled with apples at the end
   of the movie.)

   “Crest Whitestrips”

   “Sharks vs. Volcanoes”

   “King Tut vs. King Kong”

   “Streptococcus vs. Candidiasis” (Strep Throat vs. Yeast Infection)

   “The Do-Over”

   “The Switcheroo”

   “Street Smart”

   “Street Stupid” (“Street Smart” sequel)

   “Fat Astronaut”

   “The Untitled Liam Neeson Vendetta Project”

   “Human Quilt” (horror movie)

   “The Cute Bear from Those Toilet-Paper Ads Movie”

   Those movies all sound great to me, and, incidentally, I am prepared to
   write any of them, if there is interest. But what I’d really like to
   write is a romantic comedy. This is my favorite kind of movie. I feel
   almost embarrassed revealing this, because the genre has been so
   degraded in the past twenty years that saying you like romantic
   comedies is essentially an admission of mild stupidity. But that has
   not stopped me from enjoying them.

   I like watching people fall in love onscreen so much that I can suspend
   my disbelief in the contrived situations that occur only in the
   heightened world of romantic comedies. I have come to enjoy the moment
   when the male lead, say, slips and falls right on top of the expensive
   wedding cake. I actually feel robbed when the female lead’s dress
   doesn’t get torn open at a baseball game while the JumboTron camera is
   on her. I regard romantic comedies as a subgenre of sci-fi, in which
   the world operates according to different rules than my regular human
   world. For me, there is no difference between Ripley from “Alien” and
   any Katherine Heigl character. They are equally implausible. They’re
   all participating in a similar level of fakey razzle-dazzle, and I
   enjoy every second of it.

   It makes sense, then, that in the romantic-comedy world there are many
   specimens of women who—like Vulcans or Mothra—do not exist in real
   life. Here are some examples:

   The Klutz

   When a beautiful actress is cast in a movie, executives rack their
   brains to find some kind of flaw in the character she plays that will
   still allow her to be palatable. She can’t be overweight or not
   perfect-looking, because who would pay to see that? A female who is not
   one hundred per cent perfect-looking in every way? You might as well
   film a dead squid decaying on a beach somewhere for two hours.

   So they make her a Klutz.

   The hundred-per-cent-perfect-looking female is perfect in every way
   except that she constantly bonks her head on things. She trips and
   falls and spills soup on her affable date (Josh Lucas. Is that his
   name? I know it’s two first names. Josh George? Brad Mike? Fred Tom?
   Yes, it’s Fred Tom). The Klutz clangs into stop signs while riding her
   bike and knocks over giant displays of fine china in department stores.
   Despite being five feet nine and weighing a hundred and ten pounds, she
   is basically like a drunk buffalo who has never been a part of human
   society. But Fred Tom loves her anyway.

   The Ethereal Weirdo

   The smart and funny writer Nathan Rabin coined the term Manic Pixie
   Dream Girl to describe this archetype after seeing Kirsten Dunst in the
   movie “Elizabethtown.” This girl can’t be pinned down and may or may
   not show up when you make concrete plans with her. She wears gauzy
   blouses and braids. She likes to dance in the rain and she weeps
   uncontrollably if she sees a sign for a missing dog or cat. She might
   spin a globe, place her finger on a random spot, and decide to move
   there. The Ethereal Weirdo appears a lot in movies, but nowhere else.
   If she were from real life, people would think she was a homeless woman
   and would cross the street to avoid her. But she is essential to the
   male fantasy that even if a guy is boring he deserves a woman who will
   find him fascinating and perk up his dreary life by forcing him to go
   skinny-dipping in a stranger’s pool.

   The Woman Who Is Obsessed with Her Career and Is No Fun at All

   I regularly work sixteen hours a day. Yet, like most people I know who
   are similarly busy, I’m a pleasant, pretty normal person. But that’s
   not how working women are depicted in movies. I’m not always barking
   orders into my hands-free phone device and yelling, “I have no time for
   this!” Often, a script calls for this uptight career woman to “relearn”
   how to seduce a man, and she has to do all sorts of crazy degrading
   crap, like eat a hot dog in a sexy way or something. And since when
   does holding a job necessitate that a woman pull her hair back in a
   severe, tight bun? Do screenwriters think that loose hair makes it hard
   to concentrate?

   The Forty-two-Year-Old Mother of the Thirty-Year-Old Male Lead

   If you think about the backstory of a typical mother character in a
   romantic comedy, you realize this: when “Mom” was an adolescent, the
   very week she started to menstruate she was impregnated with a baby who
   would grow up to be the movie’s likable brown-haired leading man. I am
   fascinated by Mom’s sordid early life. I would rather see this movie
   than the one I bought a ticket for.

   I am so brainwashed by the young-mom phenomenon that when I saw the
   poster for “The Proposal” I wondered for a second if the proposal in
   the movie was Ryan Reynolds’ suggesting that he send his mother, Sandra
   Bullock, to an old-age home.

   The Sassy Best Friend

   You know that really hilarious and horny best friend who is always
   asking about your relationship and has nothing really going on in her
   own life? She always wants to meet you in coffee shops or wants to go
   to Bloomingdale’s to sample perfumes? She runs a chic dildo store in
   the West Village? Nope? O.K., that’s this person.

   The Skinny Woman Who Is Beautiful and Toned but Also Gluttonous and
   Disgusting

   Again, I am more than willing to suspend my disbelief for good set
   decoration alone. One pristine kitchen from a Nancy Meyers movie like
   “It’s Complicated” compensates for five scenes of Diane Keaton being
   caught half naked in a topiary. But I can’t suspend disbelief enough,
   for instance, if the gorgeous and skinny heroine is also a ravenous pig
   when it comes to food. And everyone in the movie—her parents, her
   friends, her boss—are all complicit in this huge lie. They constantly
   tell her to stop eating. And this actress, this poor skinny actress who
   obviously lost weight to play the likable lead character, has to say
   things like “Shut up, you guys! I love cheesecake! If I want to eat an
   entire cheesecake, I will!” If you look closely, you can see this
   woman’s ribs through the dress she’s wearing—that’s how skinny she is,
   this cheesecake-loving cow.

   The Woman Who Works in an Art Gallery

   How many freakin’ art galleries are out there? Are people buying visual
   art on a daily basis? This posh/smart/classy profession is a favorite
   in movies. It’s in the same realm as kindergarten teacher or
   children’s-book illustrator in terms of accessibility: guys don’t
   really get it, but it is likable and nonthreatening.

   Art Gallery Woman: “Dust off the Warhol. You know, that Campbell’s Soup
   one in the crazy color! We have an important buyer coming into town,
   and this is a really big deal for my career. I have no time for this!”

   The Gallery Worker character is the rare female movie archetype that
   has a male counterpart. Whenever you meet a handsome, charming,
   successful man in a romantic comedy, the heroine’s friend always says
   the same thing: “He’s really successful. He’s”—say it with me—“an
   architect!”

   There are, like, nine people in the entire world who are architects,
   and one of them is my dad. None of them look like Patrick Dempsey. ♦

What Amazon’s Purchase of Whole Foods Really Means

   By Joshua Rothman

   Behind the scenes, Amazon has been using technology to vertically
   integrate nearly the entire process of consumption.
   Courtesy Amazon / YouTube

   Last week, two days before announcing that it would be acquiring Whole
   Foods, Amazon released a short promotional video for a new product
   called the Dash Wand. The Wand is a candy-bar-size gizmo that costs
   twenty dollars. It sticks to your refrigerator with magnets and lets
   you order products by talking—it features Amazon’s voice assistant,
   Alexa—or by scanning barcodes. In the video, an affluent, middle-aged
   couple drift through their spotless kitchen, preparing for a dinner
   party. The woman peers into the fridge, where she discovers a bag of
   pre-peeled shrimp. She asks the Wand for a simple shrimp-pasta recipe,
   then orders ingredients for it, scanning the barcode of an empty jar of
   pasta sauce and proclaiming, “Mushrooms!” The next day, these items are
   delivered in a cooler bag. While cooking, she uses up the white wine,
   so the man, who’s milling around in the kitchen, tells the Wand, “Order
   white wine from Prime Now.” (Prime Now is Amazon’s same-day delivery
   service.) Shortly before the dinner guests arrive, he says, “Dim lights
   to seventy per cent.” When the other couples materialize, the
   thoroughly unstressed host proposes a toast: “To old friends!”

   There is something horrible about this little video. Why do the
   inhabitants of this suburban home require a recipe for pasta from a
   jar? Why can’t they turn the lights down using their hands? If the ad
   were an episode of “Black Mirror,” they would be clones living in a
   laboratory, attempting to follow the patterns of an outside world
   they’ve never seen. And yet the ad is not fantastical but descriptive.
   It’s unsettling because it’s an accurate portrayal of our new
   mail-order way of life, which Amazon has spent the past twenty-two
   years creating.

   It hasn’t always been obvious that Amazon would transform the feeling
   of everyday life. At first, the company looked like a bookstore; next,
   it became a mass retailer; later, for somewhat obscure reasons, it
   transformed into a television and movie studio. It seemed to be growing
   horizontally, by learning to sell new kinds of products. But Amazon
   wasn’t just getting wider; it was getting deeper, too. It wasn’t just
   selling products but inventing a new method of selling; behind the
   scenes, it was using technology to vertically integrate nearly the
   entire process of consumption. This integration is Amazon’s real
   product. It’s what you purchase when you become a member of Amazon
   Prime. (According to some estimates, eighty million American
   households—more than sixty per cent of the total—have Prime
   memberships.)

   Amazon has created the world’s most efficient order-fulfillment system,
   including a network of warehouses and a delivery arm, Amazon Logistics.
   It has started a shipping subsidiary, Amazon Maritime, to transport
   goods on cargo ships from China to the United States. Netflix, NASA,
   and the C.I.A. are among the million customers who run their systems
   using Amazon’s cloud-computing platform, Amazon Web Services; this
   year, A.W.S. is expected to earn thirteen billion dollars in
   revenue—about as much as the N.F.L. In addition to its own
   point-of-sale devices—the Dash Button, Dash Wand, and Amazon Echo—it
   has created its own in-house advertising ecosystem: television shows
   like “Transparent” may win Emmys, but they also encourage customers to
   sign up for Amazon Prime, and pull them away from traditional
   television, where they might see ads for competing companies, such as
   Walmart. Amazon, in short, is far more than a retailer. It’s like
   Diebold, U.P.S., Target, the CW, I.B.M., and S.A.P. combined.

   Ben Thompson, a technology analyst who writes the blog Stratechery, has
   proposed an extraordinarily useful model for understanding Amazon’s
   reach. He argues that Amazon works by dividing the world of commerce up
   into building blocks, which he calls “primitives.” Some “primitives”
   are business-facing: servers, databases, warehouses, delivery trucks.
   Others are consumer-facing: books, music, clothing, television shows.
   Amazon makes money by allowing its customers to combine these
   primitives in unusually convenient and efficient ways. Using them, it’s
   possible to run a whole company from within the Amazon ecosystem, with
   servers running in Amazon’s cloud and products stored in and shipped
   from its warehouses. Amazon itself launches new businesses using the
   primitives it has mastered. Many people have seen the Whole Foods
   acquisition as a way for Amazon to sell fancier groceries online, while
   using its larger scale and greater efficiency to lower prices. But, in
   Thompson’s view, the acquisition is best understood as giving Amazon
   access to new, grocery-based primitives, such as fruit, vegetables,
   meats, and food-ready warehouses. He suggests that the company will
   launch “Amazon Grocery Services,” a subsidiary that farmers or small
   manufacturers might use to sell, warehouse, and ship their products.
   Restaurants could stock their kitchens with it, too.

   Where will it end? At first, as Amazon added more building blocks to
   its toolkit, the world changed in intangible ways. Ordering got easier;
   packages arrived faster. Lately, though, the physical changes have
   grown more apparent. Already, we spend less time shopping in the
   physical world. Now the disappearance of bookstores seems to be
   extending to retail stores more generally. Grocery stores, too, will
   soon be thinner on the ground. Along with the leaf blower and the
   ice-cream truck, the delivery van, nosing into one driveway after
   another, is now a staple of suburban life.

   It’s increasingly easy to imagine that a few decades from now, we’ll
   tell our kids about how we used to “go to the store”; they’ll look at
   us and say, “What?” Earlier this month, Amazon filed a patent
   application describing large, multi-story drone towers in urban
   centers. Probably, in the future, such buildings will seem
   unremarkable. The hive-like towers will have loading docks and
   warehouses on the lower floors and bays for drones higher up; the
   drones may be repaired and supplied by robots. “There is a growing need
   and desire to locate fulfillment centers within cities, such as in
   downtown districts,” the patent application says. How else would your
   wine beat your guests to the door?

   When David Stinson finished high school, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in
   1977, the first thing he did was get a job building houses. After a few
   years, though, the business slowed. Stinson was then twenty-four, with
   two children to support. He needed something stable. As he explained
   over lunch recently, that meant finding a job at one of the two
   companies in the area that offered secure, blue-collar work. “Either
   I’ll be working at General Motors or I’ll be working at Steelcase by
   the end of the year,” he vowed in 1984. A few months later, he got a
   job at Steelcase, the world’s largest manufacturer of office furniture,
   and he’s been working at its Grand Rapids metal plant ever since.

   Stinson is now fifty-eight. He has a full, reddish face, a thick head
   of silver hair, and a majestic midsection. His navy polo shirt displays
   his job title—“Zone Leader”—and, like everyone else in the plant, he
   always has a pair of protective earplugs on a neon string draped around
   his neck. His glasses have plastic shields on the sides that give him
   the air of a cranky scientist.

   “I don’t regret coming here,” Stinson said. We were sitting in the
   plant’s cafeteria, and Stinson was unwrapping an Italian sub, supplied
   by a deli that every Thursday offers plant workers sandwiches for four
   dollars instead of eight. “There’s been times I’ve thought about
   leaving, but it’s just getting to be a much more comfortable atmosphere
   around here. The technology is really helping that kind of thing, too.
   Instead of taking responsibility away from you, it’s a big aid. It’s
   definitely the wave of the future here.”

   William Sandee, Jr., a sixty-four-year-old worker on the paint line,
   sat down next to Stinson with a carton of fries and a cup of ketchup,
   and tossed his safety goggles on the table. “We try to have some fun
   with it,” he said in a low near-growl. “It can get intense.”

   Sandee, who has neatly combed gray hair and an alert, owlish face,
   began working at Steelcase in 1972, after waiting in line with six
   hundred people just to put in an application. “They made it very
   lucrative to be a Steelcase employee, back in the day,” Sandee said.
   Plant managers were known to drive fancy cars and have second homes on
   the lake; the company paid the college tuition for employees’ children,
   who often spent summers working at the local plants; and there were
   company picnics and a bowling tournament, which once had fifteen
   hundred players. (The tournament is still held, now with around three
   hundred participants.)

   In the nineties, Steelcase employed more than ten thousand workers in
   the United States and operated seven factories around Grand Rapids,
   making chairs, filing cabinets, desks, and tables, and the screws,
   bolts, and casters that went into them. Packed shoulder to shoulder,
   workers polished and painted wood and assembled steel parts by hand.
   Today, there are only two Steelcase plants in Michigan—the metal
   factory, which makes desks and filing cabinets, and a nearby “wood
   plant,” which produces wood furniture. In total, they employ fewer than
   two thousand workers. The company’s only other U.S. plant, in Athens,
   Alabama, employs a thousand full-time workers.

   The history of Steelcase, in many ways, is the history of manufacturing
   in America. The company was founded in 1912 with one product, a
   fireproof metal wastebasket. As the economy boomed in the following
   decades, America’s burgeoning corporations needed to furnish their
   offices with desks and shelving and cubicle walls. “If you were a
   high-school kid growing up in Grand Rapids in the eighties and you
   didn’t want to go to college, and you got a job at a Steelcase factory,
   you were set,” Rob Kirkbride, who covered Steelcase for almost two
   decades at the Grand Rapids Press and industry publications, told me.
   “It was like winning the lottery.”
   “Memoir, Chapter 1. At times, I think I may have never fully gotten
   over the death of my parents . . .”

   Then the dot-com bubble burst and countless startups found themselves
   auctioning off their office furniture. By 2001, Steelcase had lost a
   third of its sales and started closing plants throughout western
   Michigan. Its manufacturing was moved to Mexico, China, and eventually
   India. In 2011, the company announced a new series of closings and
   layoffs, shutting another plant near Grand Rapids, one in Texas, and
   one in Ontario, Canada. Almost all the company’s chair manufacturing
   was relocated to Mexico.

   These days, as U.S. companies report record profits and demand millions
   of sleek new workspaces, Steelcase is again on the upswing. Its
   corporate headquarters, housed in a refurbished factory, is a
   laboratory of workplace trends, with open floor plans and
   glass-sheathed work pods where people recline with their laptops or
   hover at standing desks. In the two Michigan plants that remain open,
   employees create metal components for furniture sets and conference
   tables in dozens of shades of wood veneer.

   As technology is making the work faster, more efficient, and more
   environmentally sound, the products are being created with far fewer
   workers. “Companies are obviously not sending out press releases
   saying, ‘We’re not hiring more people,’ but that’s what I hear on the
   street,” Kirkbride said. There are automated assembly lines, and
   robotic arms lifting tabletops that were once hauled by men. Stinson
   took me across a dense wall of machinery and past a giant contraption
   that makes cardboard boxes so that the plant doesn’t have to order
   them. “You can just punch it into the touch screen there and go, I need
   86-17, boom-boom-boom, I need fourteen of ’em. Hit the button, and it
   cuts it for you,” he said. “That kind of stuff is really cool. So it
   isn’t so much that we’re eliminating jobs, we’re eliminating the
   waste.”

   As a zone leader, Stinson is responsible for about fifteen employees on
   a section of the production line that makes parts for Steelcase’s Ology
   series—height-adjustable tables built for the standing-desk craze.
   Until last year, the plant workers had to consult a long list of steps,
   taking pains to remove the correct parts out of a cart filled with
   variously sized bolts and screws and pins and to insert each one in the
   correct hole and in the correct order. Now computerized workstations,
   called “vision tables,” dictate, step by step, how workers are to
   assemble a piece of furniture. The process is virtually mistake-proof:
   the system won’t let the workers proceed if a step isn’t completed
   correctly. We stood behind a young woman wearing a polo shirt and Lycra
   shorts, with a long blond ponytail. When a step was completed, a light
   turned on above the next required part, accompanied by a
   beep-beep-whoosh sound. A scanner overhead tracked everything as it was
   happening, beaming the data it collected to unseen engineers with
   iPads. Employees who follow a strict automated protocol—some call them
   “meat robots”—need little training. Even the drill was attached to a
   computer-assisted arm; the worker just had to move it to the right
   position and let the machine do its magic. A decade ago, industrial
   robots assisted workers in their tasks. Now workers—those who
   remain—assist the robots in theirs.

   For decades, the conventional view among economists was that
   technological advances create as many opportunities for workers as they
   take away. In the past several years, however, research has begun to
   suggest otherwise. “It’s not that we’re running out of work or jobs per
   se,” David Autor, an M.I.T. economist who studies the impact of
   automation on employment, said. “But a subset of people with low skill
   levels may not be able to earn a reasonable standard of living based on
   their labor. We see that already.” As automation depresses wages, jobs
   in factories become both less abundant and less appealing.

   This process, Autor and other economists argue, can also exacerbate
   inequality. The labor market is built around the idea of labor
   scarcity: each person has a bundle of labor—his or her own capacity to
   work—that employers need and that she can sell in the job market
   through employment during the course of a career of thirty years or so.
   That model is eroding. “It doesn’t mean there’s no money around, but
   it’s just accruing to the owners of capital, to the owners of ideas,”
   Autor says. “And capital is less equitably distributed than labor.
   Everyone is born with some labor, but not everyone is born with
   capital.”

   In the Steelcase metal factory, automation has led the company to seek
   out more highly educated managers, who are now expected to have a
   college degree, not just a high-school diploma. The company, following
   the “lean manufacturing” model pioneered by Toyota, hires young
   engineers to scan factory data for additional “efficiencies,” which can
   translate into further automation. For people who have technical
   degrees and can manage automated systems, and for owners of companies
   that are in the process of automating, the potential for increased
   wealth is significant. But for less skilled workers it’s a different
   story. In a paper from earlier this year, the economists Daron
   Acemoglu, of M.I.T., and Pascual Restrepo, of Boston University,
   studied local job markets in the United States between 1990 and 2007,
   and they found that the concentration of industrial robots in an area
   was directly related to a decline in jobs and in pay. Technology can
   compound the effects of globalization. By one measure, the average
   manufacturing worker in the United States earned nine per cent less in
   2015 than the average worker in 1973, while the economy over all grew
   by two hundred per cent. At Steelcase, Stinson acknowledged, workers
   were earning around the same dollar salary that they had in 1987.

   Neither Stinson nor Sandee thought that automation posed a threat to
   their jobs, though. Sandee remembers when Frank Merlotti, a legendary
   figure at Steelcase who retired as president and C.E.O. in 1990, used
   to visit the plant and deliver rousing speeches to the workers. “Frank
   would look at you, and he would say this before he would even say much
   of anything,” Sandee recalled. “ ‘Listen,’ he says, ‘it’s you people,
   you people, all you people out here who make this thing work, who make
   it happen.’ ”

   Sandee speaks fervently about the dignity of manual labor. He told me
   about a trip he had taken with his grandkids to New York City, where
   they had visited the Empire State Building. “You’ve probably seen that
   picture of those guys, where they’re sitting way up there on all that
   steel, up there, they’re eating their lunch together,” Sandee said.
   “And they got some rivets and stuff there. But the rivets, in my
   opinion, are the people.” He seemed to be describing a famous
   black-and-white photograph titled “Lunch Atop a Skyscraper.” “That was
   one of the nicest things I saw there, of all of New York City, it was
   those old-timers. Building that building. How did they do it, you know?
   It’s amazing.”

   In Sandee’s opinion, there was something irreplaceable about the
   combination of sentient judgment and human hands. Think of all the
   things that robots couldn’t do: get their hands into things; unpack a
   box; close a twist-tie. Even in an automated future, he thought, you’d
   need people to apply the wisdom gained through age and experience.
   “You’re still gonna have to have the people here,” he said. “Somebody’s
   still gotta man that machine that’s supposed to be able to do
   everything. And tell us when that machine doesn’t want to work the way
   it’s supposed to.”

   The Humans to Robots Laboratory, at Brown University, is on the ground
   floor of a red brick building in the center of Providence, Rhode
   Island. It has the feel of an oversized garage, filled with stained,
   lumpy sofas and scattered gadgets and toys, along with the odd takeout
   food carton. There, on a recent afternoon, a robot with bulky red arms
   set about pulling the petals from an artificial daisy. The robot, known
   around the lab as Winnie, held the flower in a pair of rubber-tipped
   pincers, then retracted its other arm, rotated it slightly, and pointed
   it down toward the daisy. It emitted an idling-motor sound, as though
   contemplating what to do next. Then the hand jerked down toward the
   flower, grabbed a petal, and flung it on the table. It retracted again,
   with a mechanical reeeh-raaah! noise. The movements evoked a
   prehistoric bird.

   The lab was created by Stefanie Tellex, a computer-science professor
   who studies ways to create robots that can work coöperatively with
   humans. “Broadly, my research program is about making robots that can
   work with people on complex tasks,” Tellex told me. “We’re trying to
   make robots that can robustly perceive and manipulate the objects in
   their environment.”
   “I can’t wait to introduce you to all the people I used to be friends
   with, before I started spending all my time with you.”

   The word “manipulate” comes up often among roboticists. Even in highly
   automated factories, jobs that involve packing boxes or putting tiny
   parts together are done by people. The most agile robot, confronted
   with an object that it’s never seen before, can pick it up only ninety
   per cent of the time, which isn’t good enough for industrial purposes.

   Solving this problem—teaching a machine to handle a random assortment
   of irregularly shaped objects—would have an immense impact; Tellex
   envisages machines that change diapers and prepare dinner. In her class
   Topics in Collaborative Robotics, one student proposed to teach a robot
   to make a salad. “It’s very difficult, and probably not very cost
   efficient, for a robot to make a salad,” Tellex’s teaching assistant,
   Josh Roy, said. “We joked that we could make a thirty-thousand-dollar
   salad with a robot.” Part of the challenge, whatever the task, is
   devising an “end effector”—the handlike tool at the end of the robot’s
   arm—that can grip a variety of shapes and sizes and textures with
   different levels of pressure. The more complex part, and the part that
   preoccupies Tellex, involves teaching the robot to perceive the
   different objects so that it understands what it’s supposed to do.

   Winnie was programmed by one of Tellex’s students, Rebecca Pankow, a
   first-year Ph.D. candidate with bright brown eyes and dimples. “It’s
   not very refined,” Pankow said, as Winnie continued pulling petals.
   “This is more of a proof of concept.” She went on, “I chose this
   project because I thought it was an interesting computer-vision
   problem. It’s applicable to other things that I work on outside this
   class. And I just thought it was very cute.”

   An industrial robot will pick up the same object, in the same location,
   over and over. The challenge, and the multibillion-dollar business
   opportunity, was to teach a robot to function in an environment that
   was constantly changing. This was Winnie’s assignment. “There’s a
   saying in robotics: Anything a human being can do after age five is
   very easy for a robot,” one of Tellex’s students had said to me
   earlier. “Learn to play chess, no problem. Learn to walk, no way.”

   John Oberlin, another Ph.D. student, who wore a long brown ponytail,
   safety goggles, and sandals with wool socks, bent his tall frame over a
   computer on a side table. The screen showed what Winnie was “seeing”
   through its hand-camera. “If I were going to try and pick up this tape
   over and over”—Oberlin picked up and dropped a roll of masking tape—“it
   only exists in one way, on the table,” he told me. “So I can just
   memorize what it looks like in one way, and then all I have to do is
   search this space, basically. But these petals on this flower have more
   than one way to fall. Sometimes they can be rotated a little bit,
   sometimes they can droop, sometimes they can curve, so these petals are
   deformable. And that makes them inherently harder to localize.”

   Pankow had retrofitted an artificial flower with little magnets on its
   petals, so that they could be reattached and reused. “The camera is
   currently taking a picture of the table,” she said. “And then you put
   the flower there, and it will take the picture again. And it will say,
   ‘Oh, look at the difference between the two—a flower has appeared.’ ”

   Winnie’s arm moved in, clamped its pincers around a petal, plucked it
   off, and then threw it onto the table. It made the reeeh-raaah! noise
   and then went back to idling. The cycle continued until there was only
   one petal left. It was sticking out at an awkward angle, and Winnie’s
   arm hovered for a long time above it. Pankow and Oberlin watched
   nervously.

   Winnie moved in, its arm quivering slightly, and positioned its arm to
   the outside of the flower in a way that looked unlikely to succeed. The
   grippers opened, trying but failing to close around the petal. Then the
   arm pulled up again. Reeeh-raaah!

   Oberlin adjusted the flower. “I bet it comes down a little bit . . .”
   he said. This time, Winnie managed to peel off the final petal.

   Pankow and Oberlin spoke about the adjustments that would have to be
   made for the technology to be usable in the real world. “You can
   imagine this ability to classify or examine plants or other structures
   in terms of their parts, in order to compose or localize each one of
   those petals—that has applications in actual industry,” Oberlin said.
   “You can imagine applying that modelling technique to real plants.”

   “Blueberries,” Tellex said quietly, leaning against the window. “That’s
   my goal. People aren’t going to pay us to take petals off of daisies.
   But they will pay us to pick blueberries.” She looked down at the table
   and the bare daisy stem. “Did it just pick all of these? In order? This
   is awesome. This is not something I’ve ever seen a robot do. And that’s
   cool. And now we’ve figured some things out, as a result of doing
   this.”

   Harvesting fruit and other produce, which involves hours under the hot
   sun, is the kind of job that Americans are increasingly reluctant to do
   and that often goes to low-paid immigrant labor. Yet the implications
   extend beyond agriculture. A robot that could efficiently pick
   blueberries could probably do a lot of things that are currently the
   exclusive province of human beings. Potentially, it could advance on a
   frontier challenge of industrial robotics—not only picking a wallet out
   of a bin but riffling through it and pulling out a credit card.

   “I usually like to ask the question: How can this help make society
   better?” Tellex said. “What is something that people do now that robots
   might do?”

   Corporate executives want to know the answer to that question, but they
   seldom ask it publicly. Automation is a topic that gets treated with
   enormous diplomacy, both in Europe and in the United States. The Dutch
   supermarket chain Ahold Delhaize, which owns the Stop & Shop and Peapod
   grocery-store brands in the U.S., hopes to have all its retail outlets
   cleaned by robots within five years. Although the company was not eager
   to publicize the details of the venture, the images that spring to mind
   are part Isaac Asimov and part Dr. Seuss—doors closing with a thud and
   the aisles bursting to life, with metallic objects scampering across
   the floor, brightly colored squeegees and sponges dropping from the
   ceiling, followed by an explosion of soapsuds and baby carrots. But the
   goal wasn’t to replace human workers, a company spokesperson insisted.
   With store-cleaning robots, “our associates in our stores will have
   more time for customers.”

   Such initiatives aren’t limited to private businesses; neither are the
   sensitivities. In southern Denmark, the regional government hired a
   chief robotics officer, Poul Martin Møller, to help integrate more
   robots into the public sector, largely as a money-saving measure. He
   decided that the Danish hospital system, which was under pressure to
   reduce costs, could benefit from robotic orderlies. There were few
   medical-oriented robots on the market, though, so Møller and his team
   took small, mobile robots with movable arms, designed for use in
   warehouses, and refashioned them, so that they could carry supplies to
   doctors and nurses. The machines worked well, scuttling through surgery
   wings and psych wards like helpful crabs, never complaining or taking
   cigarette breaks. But Møller wasn’t prepared for the reaction of the
   hospital staff, who recognized their mechanical colleagues as potential
   replacements, and tried to sabotage them. Fecal matter and urine were
   left in charging stations.

   Since then, Møller has evangelized about “change management,” and the
   need to handle people carefully as new technology is introduced. “As a
   taxpayer, here we pay thirty-three, thirty-four dollars an hour for
   unskilled work, like orderlies,” he told me. “Robots cost, at most,
   around ninety-five cents an hour. If you do the math, you can have
   thirty-five robots for one human. So you might as well face reality and
   face facts. That means you have a bunch of orderlies who need jobs.” By
   way of redress, he proposes using the robot-derived savings, at least
   initially, to retrain the displaced humans for more sophisticated jobs
   that the robots can’t (yet) do.

   In the United States, where automation in the workplace is no less
   politically fraught, corporate executives are reluctant to be quoted on
   the subject; when they are, their usual line is that robots aren’t
   replacing humans but simply helping to make their jobs less taxing.
   This is not entirely a misrepresentation. When I asked Dave Stinson and
   his colleagues at Steelcase about how automation had affected the
   assembly line, they said, for the most part, that it had made things
   easier. The factory was cleaner, less noisy, more productive. When
   something went wrong with the assembly, they could diagnose the problem
   swiftly, by consulting the data. Most workers welcomed being rotated
   through different positions, rather than doing the same thing for years
   at a time.

   The work placed less stress on their bodies, too. At one time,
   twenty-five hundred steel tabletops came off the assembly line each
   day, requiring two men to sweat and strain to get each one into the
   right place; now a robotic arm with grippers moved the tops.
   Workers—the ones who had survived the economic downturns, offshoring,
   and technological changes—had an easier time than ever before. In the
   old days, Stinson said, “It was, How much longer am I going to be able
   to do this? That’s kind of a question that you would always ask—how
   much longer can I hold up doing this, physically just holding up?
   Ergonomically, the difference today is huge. Huge.” Now he could work
   longer without burning out, and the work was easier. Who could complain
   about that?

   Automation has also increased the amount of manufacturing in the United
   States, by making it more efficient. The most immediate way that it
   makes manufacturing more efficient, of course, is by requiring fewer
   workers. Still, when manufacturing that has been sent overseas comes
   back, it brings some jobs back, too, even if they are not the same
   complement of jobs, and not in their old numbers. Last year, for the
   first time in decades, the number of Americans employed in
   manufacturing increased—more jobs returned or were created than
   left—and automation-enabled “reshoring” is a big reason for that.

   In a hundred-and-twenty-five-thousand-square-foot factory in the town
   of Hatfield, Pennsylvania, forty-five minutes north of Philadelphia,
   dozens of giant, automated industrial presses loom over a cement
   landscape. They belong to the Rodon Group, one of the largest
   family-owned injection-molding companies in the country. Founded in
   1956, the company makes millions of high-end plastic parts each year:
   containers for cosmetics, caps, pushpin heads, bottle tops.

   One of Rodon’s subsidiaries was a “construction toy” company—comparable
   to Lego and Fischertechnik—called K’Nex. The K’Nex line had been
   invented by the son of the Rodon Group’s founder, and, in the late
   nineteen-nineties and early two-thousands, it was run by a former
   Hasbro executive. Hasbro, like most of the American toy industry, had
   moved its production to China, and the executive decided to do the same
   thing with K’Nex. There were trade-offs with outsourcing: quality
   control was less reliable, and it was harder to respond nimbly to
   changing customer demands in the trend-driven toy business. But the
   savings were dramatic; on average, it cost less than half as much to
   make a product in China as it did in the United States.

   Michael Araten, the current C.E.O. of K’Nex Brands and the
   grandson-in-law of Rodon’s founder, told me that business had been
   relatively stable until the financial crisis arrived, and sales
   plunged. Rodon laid off around forty people, about a third of its
   workforce. Araten said that when business picked up the discussion
   quickly turned to how the company could rehire those people. One
   obvious solution presented itself: K’Nex could bring its manufacturing
   back to the United States so long as it could remain price-competitive
   with the China-sourced toy companies. K’Nex managers concluded that
   reshoring was feasible, but they would have to automate as much of the
   process as possible.

   On a recent visit, the plant’s manufacturing floor was filled with the
   sound of molding presses clamping down with as much as four hundred
   tons of pressure. No people were visible. Most of the presses work
   twenty-four hours a day, drawing plastic resin into a hopper, heating
   it to six hundred degrees Fahrenheit, and then blasting the liquid into
   molds, which are enormous blocks of stainless steel,
   precision-fabricated in an adjacent tool shop to create the shape of
   the desired part. (The molds used to be hand-fashioned by
   tool-and-die-makers, who were considered artisans; now a series of
   programmable robots do most of the job.) Automated arms lift the parts
   up to cool, before depositing them in boxes. The completed parts are
   bright orange, purple, and red, and resemble dime-store candies. Once
   the boxes are full, human workers replace them, and wheel the full ones
   away to be shipped out to their customers.

   A twenty-five-year-old “automation tech” named John Wilson had been
   hired to help integrate robotics into the plant as it moved toward
   increasing automation. Wilson is pale and thin, with glasses and a dark
   beard; he speaks in a low monotone, and gives the sense of someone who
   is more comfortable interacting with screens than with people. The
   child of two accountants, Wilson completed a mechanical-engineering
   degree at Philadelphia University in 2014, and said that he had sought
   out a manufacturing job where he could work directly with different
   types of automated machines. The Rodon Group had obliged. During
   Wilson’s three years at the company, twenty-four new automated presses
   have been introduced. There was a time when a plant worker was
   dedicated to each press, shovelling in plastic polymers, pulling the
   cranks and pushing the buttons, and scooping out the finished products
   and loading them onto trucks. Now, Wilson explained, one operator
   manages between eight and ten presses, which are overseen by digital
   systems. As at Steelcase, the robots have reduced accidents. When I
   asked if there were any jobs in the plant that automated machines
   couldn’t do, Wilson thought for a moment and said, “Cleaning up the
   floor after these machines, and machine-tending.”

   By installing robots and controlling its payroll and other costs, the
   company has been able to make ninety per cent of its parts and products
   in the United States—a move that Araten likes to describe as “patriotic
   capitalism.” Rodon and K’Nex use their made-in-the-U.S.A. credentials
   in their marketing. President Obama visited the Hatfield plant in 2012;
   Hillary Clinton stopped by in 2016. “The choice of how you spend your
   money really matters,” Araten said. “If you buy stuff from an American
   farmer or manufacturer, you’re helping an American family.”

   Sitting in a company conference room that was lined with shelves
   displaying plastic toys and framed vintage production orders from the
   nineteen-fifties, Araten said, “I talk to C.E.O.s all the time who say,
   ‘It’s not my job to worry about the rest of the country.’ And I say,
   ‘Well, whose job is it? You’ve got to do what you can in the United
   States to keep the United States strong.’ ” He went on, “If you think
   there is a benefit to having a stable citizenry that has good-paying
   jobs, that can support a family, you need to be willing to make some
   trade-offs there. Our responsibility is, yes, to our shareholders but
   also to our employees, and to our community. We made a decision—we are
   willing to make less of a profit in order to keep jobs here.”

   Araten acknowledged that, relative to sales, the Hatfield factory
   employed fewer people than it had done in the past. (Rodon’s revenue
   has grown by an average of fifteen per cent over each of the past five
   years, while its staffing has increased much more modestly.) But the
   jobs that they do have and will have, he said, will be higher skilled
   and better paying. He argued that the government could encourage
   similar moves by other companies, through tax policy and major
   investments in education, while also preparing for the coming
   technological changes. Still, even Araten isn’t immune from the call of
   high finance: last year, he and the rest of the family decided to sell
   K’Nex to a Chinese-French private-equity firm, Cathay Capital. It is
   unclear whether his new partners will be aligned, over the long term,
   with his people-before-profit philosophy.

   “The winds are changing,” Araten said. “I think part of the reason
   populism is rising around the world is that the gap is getting too big.
   Having so much inequality creates instability in a country. Maybe
   twenty years ago, we still had too many poor people, but they believed
   that they had a shot. I believe some of that is being sucked away.”

   Manufacturing jobs now account for less than ten per cent of the
   American workforce. As plants have closed, displaced employees have
   sought work in fast-food restaurants or in big-box retail stores, where
   the pay and the benefits are substantially less attractive. And,
   increasingly, even those jobs are fading away. Storefront retail is
   fast losing ground to the online marketplace. McDonald’s is introducing
   “digital ordering kiosks” that are expected to replace human cashiers
   at fifty-five hundred restaurants by the end of 2018. Meanwhile,
   companies like Uber and Google are investing heavily in
   autonomous-driving technology, betting that such vehicles will reshape
   transportation. In August, 2016, Uber purchased Otto, a startup based
   in San Francisco that sells technology designed to automate long-haul
   trucking. There are nearly two million long-distance truck drivers in
   the United States, most of whom are male and lack a college degree;
   paying for them accounts for a third of the costs in the
   seven-hundred-billion-dollar trucking industry. Construction jobs, too,
   are threatened by automation; a New York-based firm has introduced a
   laser-guided system that can lay eight hundred to twelve hundred bricks
   a day, more than twice as many as an average mason.

   For low-skilled workers, warehouse jobs have seemed to be something of
   a bright spot. Even if fewer people are required to staff a Target or a
   Sam’s Club outlet, the movement of products requires a network of
   warehouses to store and ship goods. Amazon—the world’s largest online
   retailer—currently has more than ninety thousand employees at its U.S.
   distribution centers, and plans to hire tens of thousands more. Workers
   still do the “picking” in a warehouse, using their dexterous fingers
   and discerning brains to take soap and coffee and tubes of toothpaste
   and millions of other products off the shelves and put them into boxes
   to fulfill the online shopping orders that make up an increasing
   portion of consumers’ buying patterns.

   But the same factors that make warehouses a draw for labor have made
   them a tempting target for automation. In 2012, Amazon spent almost
   eight hundred million dollars to buy a robotics company called Kiva,
   which makes robots that can zoom around a factory floor and move tall
   stacks of shelves of up to seven hundred and fifty pounds in weight. A
   Deutsche Bank research report estimated that Amazon could save
   twenty-two million dollars a year by introducing the Kiva machines in a
   single warehouse; the savings company-wide could reach into the
   billions. With such a powerful incentive, Amazon is on a quest to
   acquire or develop systems that can replace human pickers. When, in
   June, it announced plans to buy the Whole Foods supermarket chain,
   speculation quickly spread that the company intended to automate the
   grocer’s food-distribution centers as well as its stores.

   Simply automating a legacy warehouse, however, is a halfway measure, as
   a visit to Symbotic makes clear. A privately held company based in an
   industrial park outside Boston, it sells fully automated warehouse
   systems to large retail chains, and the new warehouses resemble the old
   ones about as much as a Tesla resembles a Model T. The company’s
   twenty-thousand-square-foot test center is a giant cube of interlocking
   green, yellow, and white steel shelving, tracks, and cages that extend
   from the floor almost to the ceiling. There are no aisles for lifts to
   pass through, and no stations for human product pickers. There is no
   space inside the matrix for people at all.

   Robotic arms unpack pallets of tomato sauce, salsa, toilet paper, and
   soda, and place them on a blue conveyor belt, where they are carried
   deep into the storage cage. A fleet of little green robots that look
   like race cars in a Pixar film come to life and zoom inside the cage on
   dedicated tracks, emitting high-pitched whirring sounds. They collect
   the cases of products and stash them on shelves until they are needed.
   Then an algorithm directs the little car-bots to go back in and bring
   the desired products out.

   “This absolutely reinvents the warehouse,” Chris Gahagan, Symbotic’s
   C.E.O., said as he showed me around. He is a muscular fellow with
   dirty-blond hair pulled back in a ponytail, and looks as if he could
   have had an alternate career leading tourists on spelunking trips
   through Belize. “Now you can build an even smaller warehouse, or carry
   more skus, or serve more stores out of the same warehouse. It gives you
   huge flexibility.”

   Gahagan was recruited in 2015 by Symbotic’s owner, Richard B. Cohen,
   the press-shy billionaire owner of the C&S grocery wholesaler. Cohen
   had wanted a system that would make his grocery warehouses more
   efficient; then he realized that he could make a business of selling it
   to other retailers. Symbotic says it now has more orders than it can
   swiftly fulfill. The automated system, Gahagan notes, produces more
   efficiencies than are obvious at first glance. Because it can store
   more products in a smaller space, companies could have more compact
   warehouses closer to their retail outlets, requiring less trucking. The
   robots don’t need light to operate, so the warehouse could use, Gahagan
   estimated, thirty-five per cent less energy than a conventional one,
   while reducing labor costs by eighty per cent. Many warehouse operators
   run their businesses based on labor hours, in order to minimize
   overtime pay, among other things. But an automated system could run
   twenty-four hours a day. A typical system costs around fifty million
   dollars to install, Gahagan said—not an insignificant investment. But,
   he maintained, it would pay for itself, on average, in four and a half
   years.

   We walked past a “Safety Is Our First Priority” sign on the wall, an
   artifact from a time when there might have been frequent worker
   injuries in such a place, and clambered up a set of steel stairs. All
   around us, machines were moving, gracefully and tirelessly executing
   their tasks.
   “Folks, if that’s not government interference I don’t know what is.”

   “You start to look at all the costs that you can avoid,” he told me.
   “It’s phenomenal. So, as soon as one company does this, it makes it
   more competitive.” That instantly puts pressure on competitors to
   follow suit. “You can’t just sit there being that inefficient,” Gahagan
   went on. “Your assortment in your store is not as good, you’re paying
   more for labor, more for trucking. If a new startup came along in
   retail, it would start with this.” He gestured around at the cavernous,
   chilly space.

   The most important human job at a Symbotic warehouse is that of the
   “system operator,” which is akin to a job in flight operations, where
   you sit all day behind a bank of screens and make sure that
   everything’s working right. A couple of human workers were needed—for
   now—to help unload and load the trucks as they came and went with the
   inventory, and four or so mechanics were kept on staff to service the
   bots when they needed it (because “shit happens”). In all, the average
   system requires eight or nine people per shift, a fraction of what a
   traditional warehouse requires.

   Most jobs in warehouses are undesirable and hard to fill, Gahagan
   assured me. A typical worker might lift thousands of pounds of goods
   each day and walk the equivalent of a marathon, five or six days a
   week. It could be freezing in the winter, and sweltering during the
   summer months. “Their turnover is huge,” he said. With the robotic
   version, one higher-skilled person sits behind a console and types in
   commands, and is paid almost twice as much per hour as a manual laborer
   would be.

   Gahagan was reluctant to talk about Symbotic’s customers, who aren’t
   keen to draw attention to their interest in nearly human-free warehouse
   systems. “There is some sensitivity, given our . . . political
   situation,” he said. “It’s just a reality of the times that we live
   in.” But the Wall Street Journal has reported that Target is trying a
   Symbotic warehouse and that Walmart has installed several. Gahagan
   allowed that what he called the “red” cola giant—Coca-Cola—is using two
   Symbotic distribution centers. (“It was tricky with the unions, but
   they’ve made it work.”) Now, he said, Coke’s main competitor, the “blue
   one”—Pepsi—wanted to try the system.

   “If someone can start a warehouse with automation and sell for less,
   everyone else has to follow,” Gahagan said. “Consumers buy on price, so
   the cost on the supply chain matters. Walmart, it made a very efficient
   supply chain and that’s why it was able to offer the lowest prices in
   its stores, so everyone else had to compete. And now you’re seeing that
   happen with automation.”

   He observed that technological innovation has been happening in one way
   or another for a hundred years. Tractors replaced manual plows, but we
   were now able to produce much more food, he said; A.T.M.s replaced
   tellers, but banks still employ hundreds of thousands of people.
   “Imagine placing a phone call when you had to have someone place a wire
   into a socket for you,” he said. “Being on a switchboard—those were
   good jobs. Every time technology has evolved, yes, individual people
   are impacted. . . . But the standard of living has gone up. I’d rather
   be in the world we’re in today than a world without computers, without
   cell phones, a world without elevators.”

   We walked onto a platform where we could see a track on which the
   mobile robots were lined up, waiting to be called into action.
   Occasionally, one of them would whirr its motor and blast off, like a
   little rocket. Gahagan looked down on his robot army with affection and
   awe. “Depending on who’s in the White House next, you get to the
   fifteen-dollars-an-hour labor or twenty dollars an hour?” Gahagan said.
   “I’m voting for a thirty-dollar-an-hour minimum wage. That’d be
   fantastic marketing for us.”

   If the fully automated warehouse was a structurally different entity
   from its precursors, what about the fully automated factory? Gahagan
   had pointed out that other countries were embracing industrial robotics
   more aggressively than the United States was. I saw the scale of this
   during a recent trip to China. One steamy afternoon, I boarded a bus in
   downtown Shanghai and headed south along the Huangpu River, far from
   the city’s noodle shops and glittering luxury fashion emporiums. About
   half an hour later, I reached a vast, low building, where hundreds of
   bicycles were parked in a covered lot. Inside, I was greeted by Gerry
   Wong, the C.E.O. of Cambridge Industries Group, which manufactures
   telecommunications equipment—more than three million items a month—for
   companies such as Huawei, Nokia, and Alcatel-Lucent. Wong grew up in
   Beijing, studied electrical engineering at M.I.T., and worked at Bell
   Labs for fifteen years. He started C.I.G. in 2005, and says that the
   company produces between two and three million products each month. He
   has the air of an excitable gnome, with a mop of black hair, thick
   seventies-style eyeglasses, and a wicked laugh.

   Wong sat with his back to a wall of dozens of screens, which depicted
   various production metrics and live video of the manufacturing floor,
   where workers—and an increasing number of robots—were fabricating
   circuit boards. (I was there on a trip with a nonprofit called the
   China-U.S. Exchange Foundation.) He quickly demonstrated the lack of
   sentimentality with which many businesspeople in China approach the
   subject of automation. C.I.G. is trying to replace as many human
   workers with robots as possible, he explained. Three or so years ago,
   the company had thirty-five hundred people at work in the factory. Two
   years ago, it was twenty-five hundred. Today, it is eighteen hundred.
   Over the same period, he said proudly, the company’s output had
   doubled.

   “China’s labor costs are increasing, or doubling, every few years,”
   Wong explained. “We are actually overcoming the difficulty by
   increasing our efficiency, through automation.” For Chinese businesses,
   Wong said, lean manufacturing must include industrial automation, and
   they couldn’t make it happen fast enough.

   Much of China’s economic power during the past two decades came from
   its position as the manufacturing engine of the world, but in the past
   several years its growth has started to slow. China was never a
   particularly convenient place for Western companies to have their
   sneakers and T-shirts and widgets made; the main allure was cheap
   labor. With Chinese wages increasing sharply every year, though,
   manufacturing there has become less attractive, and the Chinese
   government is devoting enormous resources to making the country the
   automation capital of the world.

   As we put on gowns, hairnets, and cloth shoe covers in preparation for
   entering the clean manufacturing area, Wong elaborated on China’s need
   for swift automation. There was a labor shortage, he said, exacerbated
   by the longstanding one-child policy. And, as the population has become
   wealthier and the cost of living higher, fewer people were willing to
   do manufacturing work.
   “Try to ignore the hot-dog smell.”

   “We are pushing all industries to go to all automation,” Wong said. And
   the employees seemed compliant. “Probably they don’t care very much,
   not like back in the industrial revolution, in Europe, where they would
   go and destroy machines. That was the old days.”

   “They leave, anyway,” Rose Hu, a brisk, blunt woman who works as
   C.I.G.’s senior vice-president of marketing, said. “Every Chinese New
   Year, almost eighty per cent of the people, they will not come back.
   You have to have new.”

   We passed through a pressurized air lock that blasted away whatever
   dust or lint we had on our persons, and entered the clean part of the
   plant. Rows of orderly white machines, tended by workers wearing what
   looked like chef’s hats, were moving circuit boards through the
   assembly line. Robotic arms, behind windows, were doing most of the
   work, while the mortals did tasks that required fine motor skills, like
   plugging tiny components into place. Every now and then, a cute little
   robotic trolley came ambling down an aisle, playing Mozart to alert the
   humans that it was approaching. (Until recently, most industrial robots
   were separated from human workers by steel cages, to protect the
   workers from injury. Now robots that can work alongside humans without
   harming them have come into use.) Two workers hovered at a workstation
   and jammed connectors into holes in a line of circuit boards before
   sending them into a glassed-in chamber, where robotic arms soldered the
   pieces together.

   “There were thirteen people doing this. Now we have only one or two,”
   Hu said, gesturing at the two workers, one man and one woman, both
   young adults. “Before, we used people to solder. We used to have
   sixty-three people to finish one thing, and as of last year we need
   only sixteen people.”

   The circuit boards continued down an automated conveyor belt. Other
   robots placed stickers on boxes, before a group of humans moved in to
   place the circuit boards in the boxes, along with packing materials.
   “Closing the box—this is for some reason hard to automate,” Hu said,
   shaking her head.

   Each time I asked about what happened to the displaced workers, Hu and
   Wong waved away the question, amused at the predictable direction of my
   inquiries. Hu insisted that factory workers would simply find another
   place in the economy, such as the service sector. “We already went
   through several industrial revolutions—and we still have a job!” she
   said. “I think it’s people who haven’t lived through the industrial
   revolution who don’t understand this. The world changes. You constantly
   have to improve yourself to keep up.”

   Later, back in the room with the surveillance monitors, Wong gave me a
   slide show on the history of industrial revolutions. The first phase
   began around 1800, in Wong’s rendering, when the steam engine came into
   use, and was based in Britain, France, and Germany. The second phase,
   in 1900, saw the advent of electricity, and was centered in the U.S.,
   the U.K., and Germany. The third was the information-technology
   revolution, beginning in 2000 and concentrated largely in the U.S.,
   Germany, Japan, and Korea. Wong’s point was that China intended to be
   at the forefront of the fourth phase, which would center on integrating
   robotics and artificial intelligence. Finally, he put up a slide that
   said “The future: ‘Dark Factory.’ ”

   “You don’t need workers, you turn off the lights,” Wong explained,
   chuckling. “Only when an American journalist comes in we turn on the
   light.”

   Stefanie Tellex, the roboticist at Brown University, grew up in a
   conservative Catholic family in a suburb of Rochester that abuts Lake
   Ontario, where, she says, “everyone’s got a house and a yard, and
   there’s no crime.” Her father was an accountant; her mother taught
   second grade in downtown Rochester. Tellex became interested in
   computers as a child. Her father gave her an old DOS 486 when she was
   in grade school; her aunt, a programmer, supplied books of simple
   coding exercises. Tellex was admitted to M.I.T. and planned to pursue a
   liberal-arts degree, but her mother told her that liberal-arts
   graduates didn’t make any money. (“One of the best pieces of advice
   I’ve ever gotten.”) She completed her computer-science Ph.D. there in
   2010. She said that “The Jetsons,” the sixties-era animated TV series,
   helped spark her interest in robots.

   “When I think of A.I., that’s what I think of, the robot,” she said.
   “There’s a scene where they’re drinking smoothies together, the mom and
   the robot, who has a relationship with the family, but on the show
   she’s a servant. And she can do everything you can do.”

   After Winnie completed its petal-plucking tasks in Tellex’s lab, we sat
   down in her office. She told me that she had never thought about the
   political implications of her field until the tense months leading up
   to the 2016 Presidential election. Her parents were Trump voters, and
   she found herself disagreeing with them about what the causes of
   society’s ills were, and what the best solutions might be. She was
   alarmed by the anti-immigrant sentiment emanating from Trump’s rallies,
   especially having spent her adult life surrounded by researchers from
   all over the world. Economic inequality was a driving theme of the
   election, and Tellex began to see that automation was a contributing
   factor. The economy was generating wealth, but almost all of it seemed
   to be going to the wealthy. The official unemployment rate has dropped
   to 4.2 per cent in the United States—its lowest level in ten years—and
   the economy is expanding, but wages for most workers have scarcely
   budged.

   In 2015, the Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton identified
   a surprising data pattern that reflects these economic fault lines,
   finding that mortality rates for middle-aged white non-Hispanic
   Americans with only a high-school diploma have been increasing since
   the late nineteen-nineties. They attribute this trend to “deaths of
   despair” tied to the long-term loss of economic opportunity,
   particularly blue-collar jobs, and to possibly related factors such as
   opioid abuse. Deaton listed globalization, immigration, and
   technological change as likely factors behind the decline of
   middle-income workers and the related rise in inequality, but noted
   that, in the developed world, stagnant wages and an associated increase
   in death rates were unique to the United States. “The political
   explanation is the one that seems to make most sense,” he told me. What
   does he worry about if these trends continue? “How about pitchforks?”
   Deaton said, laughing awkwardly. “I mean, I don’t think this is stable
   politically. The Trump thing is probably just the beginning.”
   “One day, I will catch the koi fish that nibbled my left leg.”

   Tellex has been conducting her own research into the causes of income
   inequality and, with her friends, has amassed a reading list of
   academic studies and news articles. She is drawn to the idea of a
   universal basic income, in which citizens would receive enough money
   from the government to cover living expenses. Ultimately, she knows,
   blue-collar workers are not the only ones who may need such economic
   assistance. The disruption spurred by automation is not anticipated to
   be limited to low-skilled work; significant encroachments are expected
   in the white-collar sector as well, with experts predicting that
   professionals such as accountants, doctors, lawyers, architects,
   teachers, and journalists will all compete with increasingly capable
   computers in the future.

   There were ways, Tellex believed, to mitigate the effects of rising
   inequality without vilifying immigrants or blaming technology. “I’m one
   of the few people among my friends who regularly talks to Trump
   voters,” she said. “There’s enough money for everyone, I keep telling
   them—there is. It’s just not in your pocket, it’s in the one per cent’s
   pocket. If only we had the right progressive tax system, this wouldn’t
   be such a problem. As a roboticist, I feel a responsibility to
   communicate this to people.”

   For twenty years, Steelcase’s Corporate Development Center was housed
   in a futuristic pyramid-shaped building, which cost more than a hundred
   million dollars to build. It became a landmark of the Grand Rapids
   area; employees returning home from business trips would proudly make
   note of it as their flights descended into the Gerald R. Ford Airport.
   In 2009, in the midst of the financial crisis, Steelcase moved out of
   the building. It sat vacant until 2016, when a company called Switch
   moved in. Switch is a third-party data center, and plans to house giant
   servers there for companies like Disney and eBay.

   Dave Stinson, at Steelcase, told me that he often became emotional when
   he saw the building, and was reminded of what it represented. “It’s
   especially cool at night, when the lights are on,” he said, as a loud
   beeping forklift sound echoed in the background. “I’m getting
   sentimental. It’s a monument for our city. There was talk that they
   were going to tear it down. That would have been a huge loss.”

   After decades on the factory floor, he’s seen enough workers laid off
   to know something about losses. Bill Sandee, his colleague, tries to
   put those losses in perspective. “It was rough to see some of them
   leave,” he told me, referring to the waves of laid-off colleagues.
   “Some of them, their jobs were being eliminated because they just
   didn’t have enough work. And the company has to do something to
   survive. But it’s hard not to take it personally when you’re losing
   your job. You have to go home and tell your wife and kids, ‘I’m out of
   work.’ I remember one engineer saying, ‘I won’t be seeing you anymore,
   Bill, I just got RIF’d.’ It didn’t feel very good.” He paused. “Let’s
   face it, if you love somebody, you care about ’em. So many things in
   our lives are out of our control.”

   That didn’t feel very good, either. Stinson described the time, months
   before the Presidential election, when a friend asked him which
   candidate he was supporting, and he said, “I’m not voting for another
   Bush, and I’m not voting for another Clinton. Period.” The night before
   the election, he and his wife attended a Trump rally in Grand Rapids,
   in the heart of a state that Hillary Clinton had expected to win
   comfortably. More than four thousand people lined up for blocks to hear
   Trump at a downtown convention center. Stinson said he decided that
   night to vote for the Republican ticket. “The way I voted was based on
   the idea that we’re not losing jobs anymore, we’re not doing the NAFTA
   thing,” he said. “I hope he fulfills what he was trying to do when he
   was campaigning and it’s not going to be all broken promises.”

   He was accustomed to politicians disappointing him. Robots hadn’t yet.
   Stinson used to spend his days reminding workers of what they were
   supposed to be doing, or trying to figure out how faulty parts had
   sneaked into the system. He used to jump in and demonstrate precisely
   how a screw was supposed to go in, or whether the torque was correct.
   Now none of that was necessary. Automated machines were driving
   everything. “As opposed to having to train, train, train, train, train,
   making sure you’re getting the muscle memory right,” he said. “It was
   hard, it was stinky, it was ‘I gotta check everything.’ ”

   Back when the factory floor was thick with workers, they used to
   bicker, and Stinson says he was constantly dealing with the drama of
   their personal lives—there were illnesses and feuds and car accidents.
   No longer. The crews are thin; the pressure is less. The youngest of
   his three sons, aged thirty, works in a different department at the
   Steelcase plant. He had dropped out of college, hit hard by his
   grandfather’s death at sixty-five, and Stinson said he had encouraged
   him to go back to school or go into plastics. Still, he said, “He’s
   happy here.”

   Stinson says he is, too. He explained that his line’s productivity had
   shot way up—from a hundred and fifty desk legs a day a year ago to an
   average of eight hundred a day, and growing—which made him feel good.
   “That’s a lot of butts in a lot of seats,” he said. When I asked how
   many new workers Steelcase had hired to accommodate the increase in
   production, he said that workers were mainly being moved between
   production lines, to replace workers who had retired. The company was
   about to install two more automated workstations, though, to
   “accommodate this and future growth.”

   He gazed out at the smoothly functioning factory floor, the rows of
   machines diving and pecking in front of their human minders, performing
   a kind of dance. Even if the economy stayed strong and demand remained
   high the head count was expected to decline through attrition, year
   after year. “It’s got all the technology that you could possibly think
   of,” Stinson told me, when he showed me the vision table. “Until next
   week, when we find something else that we could change to make it
   better.” Automation was bringing greater and greater efficiency, even
   though, at a certain point, the logic of increasing efficiency would
   catch up with him, and he wouldn’t be around any longer to witness it.
   One day, the factory might go dark. In the meantime, he was enjoying
   the advantages of work that involved less work.

   “There were times when I thought I could do something else besides
   this, you know?” he said. “I really like the job a lot better than it
   was. Now I don’t feel overwhelmed anymore.” ♦

Amazon’s New Supermarket Could Be Grim News for Human Workers

   Will the technology in Amazon’s new automated grocery store, Amazon Go,
   in Seattle, put millions of retail employees out of work someday?
   Photograph by Stephen Brashear / Getty

   When Amazon announced, in June, that it was buying Whole Foods, for
   $13.7 billion, speculation arose about what, exactly, the world’s
   biggest online retailer planned to do with the high-end supermarket
   chain. Amazon had taken steps to enter the business of selling fresh
   food, but it was far from the company’s areas of expertise. Some noted
   that Amazon was, and continues to be, one of the most aggressive
   investors in robotics and artificial-intelligence technology. Six years
   ago, Amazon purchased Kiva, a company that produces mobile robots that
   would make it easier to automate Amazon’s distribution centers,
   potentially saving the company billions of dollars. It seemed obvious
   at the time of the Whole Foods takeover that Amazon could try to
   automate the supermarket chain as well. With the opening this week, in
   Seattle, of the first automated Amazon grocery store, called Amazon Go,
   Jeff Bezos’s vision for the future of the retail industry is fully on
   display—and it’s a vision that involves very few actual human workers.
   What Bezos has created has implications for economists, employers, and
   policymakers, and will surely fuel the debate about automation and the
   future of work.

   As I reported in The New Yorker in October, automation has been
   spreading throughout manufacturing industries around the world,
   introducing technology into assembly lines to take on some of the most
   physically taxing and repetitive work. Robots are often designed to
   initially make human workers’ jobs less stressful and more efficient,
   until the technology evolves to the point at which the roles almost
   reverse. Eventually, the humans are simply helping the machines to
   execute nearly all tasks, sometimes hovering in the background in case
   they break down. At some point after that, the human workers may not be
   needed at all, or at least not in the same ways they have been.

   Retail stores, with their unpredictable physical environments and
   constant customer interactions, by contrast, were seen as far more
   difficult than manufacturing to automate. “Retail is delayed in terms
   of high-tech automation,” Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T. who
   studies automation and the labor market, told me. “You’ve had the more
   clerical parts that have already been automated, such as cashiers and
   so on, but a lot of other areas, such as grocery stores and malls,
   they’re behind manufacturing in terms of introduction of robots,
   because the tasks performed by people there are often more complex.”
   Instead of repeatedly spraying paint onto car-body parts or drilling
   holes into pieces of steel, retail workers are often assisting
   shoppers, answering questions, or restocking shelves. “It’s somewhat
   harder,” Acemoglu said. “At the moment, and probably fortunately, it’s
   not going to lead to wholesale replacement of all the workers.” Still,
   Acemoglu acknowledged, Amazon Go is a signal of what’s to come. Retail
   stores employ 4.8 million people, according to the Bureau of Labor
   Statistics. They, and the millions of others who work in supporting
   roles behind the scenes of retail businesses, stand to be directly
   affected.

   For decades, the conventional belief among economists has been that
   technological advances have created more jobs than (or at least as many
   as) they eliminated, often moving workers into more sophisticated roles
   that couldn’t be automated; bank tellers were largely replaced by
   A.T.M.s, for example, but the number of people employed at banks
   increased nonetheless. In recent years, though, as the fields of
   robotics and A.I. have experienced vast technological leaps, the debate
   has shifted, with many economists acknowledging that the balance of
   jobs created versus jobs eliminated could start moving the other way,
   almost certainly leading to more income inequality.

   The ability to make purchases in a store using (often maddening)
   self-checkout kiosks has existed for some time; the small revolution
   that Amazon Go brings to the experience is the elimination of the
   checkout process altogether. Instead, computers scan shoppers’ phones
   as they enter, and they are then automatically charged for whatever
   items they put into their grocery bags and take home. (The Times said
   that the experience felt like “shoplifting.”) A few human workers still
   float around, to deal with glitches, answer questions, and check the
   I.D. of anyone trying to buy wine. From a consumer standpoint, there
   isn’t much to complain about: if it truly works, the technology could
   turn the chore of grocery shopping into a breezy afterthought, without
   the deadening wait in a long line to pay at the end.

   Acemoglu said that it’s far from preordained whether the technology
   that affords friction-free grocery shopping will put millions of people
   out of work, or simply create opportunities for them to move into other
   kinds of jobs. He said that the answer to that question will be decided
   by politicians and the public-policy choices they make on the tax code,
   education policy, and infrastructure spending, which have far greater
   effects than the actions of any one company—even one as large and
   powerful as Amazon. “These economic and technological conditions that
   are determining where automation is taking us, they are not set in
   stone,” Acemoglu said. “They are societal choices.”

   Acemoglu pointed out that although much is still unknown about the
   relationship between automation and employment, current tax law and
   other government policies have created incentives for employers to
   replace workers with machines, but not machines that could work
   collaboratively with human workers. In a new paper called “Artificial
   Intelligence, Automation and Work,” Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo, of
   Boston University, tried to develop a more precise way to look at the
   connection between automation and jobs. They concluded that automation
   had the potential to create greater wealth while also increasing
   economic inequality. The rise of increasingly powerful machines will
   inevitably reduce the demand for human labor, they say. But, they
   argue, with a commitment to sharing the wealth of the robot economy
   more broadly, and the appropriate investment in education that gives
   workers the skills they need to thrive, increased unemployment and
   inequality could be slowed. The survival of the machines themselves
   might even depend on it. “If we do not find a way of creating shared
   prosperity from the productivity gains generated by AI,” Acemoglu and
   Restrepo write, “there is a danger that the political reaction to these
   new technologies may slow down or even completely stop their adoption
   and development.”

Flick Chicks

A guide to women in the movies.

   A few years ago, I sat down for a meeting with some executives at a
   movie studio that I will call Thinkscope Visioncloud. Thinkscope
   Visioncloud had put out several of my favorite movies, and they wanted
   to see if I had any feature ideas. I was very excited. I have a great
   job writing for “The Office,” but, really, all television writers do is
   dream of one day writing movies. I’ll put it this way: At the Oscars
   the most famous person in the room is, like, Angelina Jolie. At the
   Emmys the huge exciting celebrity is Bethenny Frankel. You get what I
   mean. It’s snobby and grossly aspirational, but it’s true.

   The junior executives’ office at Thinkscope Visioncloud was nicer than
   any room within a fifty-mile radius of the “Office” studio. After I
   finished pitching one of my ideas for a low-budget romantic comedy, I
   was met with silence. One of the execs sheepishly looked at the other
   execs. He finally said, “Yeah, but we’re really trying to focus on
   movies about board games. People really seem to respond to those.”

   For the rest of the meeting, we talked about whether there was any
   potential in a movie called “Yahtzee!” I made some polite suggestions
   and left.

   I am always surprised at what movie studios think people will want to
   see. I’m even more surprised at how often they are correct. Based on
   what I’ve learned from my time in Hollywood, the following titles are
   my best guess as to what may soon be coming to a theatre near you:

   “Bananagrams 3D”

   “Apples to Apples 4D” (The audience is pummelled with apples at the end
   of the movie.)

   “Crest Whitestrips”

   “Sharks vs. Volcanoes”

   “King Tut vs. King Kong”

   “Streptococcus vs. Candidiasis” (Strep Throat vs. Yeast Infection)

   “The Do-Over”

   “The Switcheroo”

   “Street Smart”

   “Street Stupid” (“Street Smart” sequel)

   “Fat Astronaut”

   “The Untitled Liam Neeson Vendetta Project”

   “Human Quilt” (horror movie)

   “The Cute Bear from Those Toilet-Paper Ads Movie”

   Those movies all sound great to me, and, incidentally, I am prepared to
   write any of them, if there is interest. But what I’d really like to
   write is a romantic comedy. This is my favorite kind of movie. I feel
   almost embarrassed revealing this, because the genre has been so
   degraded in the past twenty years that saying you like romantic
   comedies is essentially an admission of mild stupidity. But that has
   not stopped me from enjoying them.

   I like watching people fall in love onscreen so much that I can suspend
   my disbelief in the contrived situations that occur only in the
   heightened world of romantic comedies. I have come to enjoy the moment
   when the male lead, say, slips and falls right on top of the expensive
   wedding cake. I actually feel robbed when the female lead’s dress
   doesn’t get torn open at a baseball game while the JumboTron camera is
   on her. I regard romantic comedies as a subgenre of sci-fi, in which
   the world operates according to different rules than my regular human
   world. For me, there is no difference between Ripley from “Alien” and
   any Katherine Heigl character. They are equally implausible. They’re
   all participating in a similar level of fakey razzle-dazzle, and I
   enjoy every second of it.

   It makes sense, then, that in the romantic-comedy world there are many
   specimens of women who—like Vulcans or Mothra—do not exist in real
   life. Here are some examples:

   The Klutz

   When a beautiful actress is cast in a movie, executives rack their
   brains to find some kind of flaw in the character she plays that will
   still allow her to be palatable. She can’t be overweight or not
   perfect-looking, because who would pay to see that? A female who is not
   one hundred per cent perfect-looking in every way? You might as well
   film a dead squid decaying on a beach somewhere for two hours.

   So they make her a Klutz.

   The hundred-per-cent-perfect-looking female is perfect in every way
   except that she constantly bonks her head on things. She trips and
   falls and spills soup on her affable date (Josh Lucas. Is that his
   name? I know it’s two first names. Josh George? Brad Mike? Fred Tom?
   Yes, it’s Fred Tom). The Klutz clangs into stop signs while riding her
   bike and knocks over giant displays of fine china in department stores.
   Despite being five feet nine and weighing a hundred and ten pounds, she
   is basically like a drunk buffalo who has never been a part of human
   society. But Fred Tom loves her anyway.

   The Ethereal Weirdo

   The smart and funny writer Nathan Rabin coined the term Manic Pixie
   Dream Girl to describe this archetype after seeing Kirsten Dunst in the
   movie “Elizabethtown.” This girl can’t be pinned down and may or may
   not show up when you make concrete plans with her. She wears gauzy
   blouses and braids. She likes to dance in the rain and she weeps
   uncontrollably if she sees a sign for a missing dog or cat. She might
   spin a globe, place her finger on a random spot, and decide to move
   there. The Ethereal Weirdo appears a lot in movies, but nowhere else.
   If she were from real life, people would think she was a homeless woman
   and would cross the street to avoid her. But she is essential to the
   male fantasy that even if a guy is boring he deserves a woman who will
   find him fascinating and perk up his dreary life by forcing him to go
   skinny-dipping in a stranger’s pool.

   The Woman Who Is Obsessed with Her Career and Is No Fun at All

   I regularly work sixteen hours a day. Yet, like most people I know who
   are similarly busy, I’m a pleasant, pretty normal person. But that’s
   not how working women are depicted in movies. I’m not always barking
   orders into my hands-free phone device and yelling, “I have no time for
   this!” Often, a script calls for this uptight career woman to “relearn”
   how to seduce a man, and she has to do all sorts of crazy degrading
   crap, like eat a hot dog in a sexy way or something. And since when
   does holding a job necessitate that a woman pull her hair back in a
   severe, tight bun? Do screenwriters think that loose hair makes it hard
   to concentrate?

   The Forty-two-Year-Old Mother of the Thirty-Year-Old Male Lead

   If you think about the backstory of a typical mother character in a
   romantic comedy, you realize this: when “Mom” was an adolescent, the
   very week she started to menstruate she was impregnated with a baby who
   would grow up to be the movie’s likable brown-haired leading man. I am
   fascinated by Mom’s sordid early life. I would rather see this movie
   than the one I bought a ticket for.

   I am so brainwashed by the young-mom phenomenon that when I saw the
   poster for “The Proposal” I wondered for a second if the proposal in
   the movie was Ryan Reynolds’ suggesting that he send his mother, Sandra
   Bullock, to an old-age home.

   The Sassy Best Friend

   You know that really hilarious and horny best friend who is always
   asking about your relationship and has nothing really going on in her
   own life? She always wants to meet you in coffee shops or wants to go
   to Bloomingdale’s to sample perfumes? She runs a chic dildo store in
   the West Village? Nope? O.K., that’s this person.

   The Skinny Woman Who Is Beautiful and Toned but Also Gluttonous and
   Disgusting

   Again, I am more than willing to suspend my disbelief for good set
   decoration alone. One pristine kitchen from a Nancy Meyers movie like
   “It’s Complicated” compensates for five scenes of Diane Keaton being
   caught half naked in a topiary. But I can’t suspend disbelief enough,
   for instance, if the gorgeous and skinny heroine is also a ravenous pig
   when it comes to food. And everyone in the movie—her parents, her
   friends, her boss—are all complicit in this huge lie. They constantly
   tell her to stop eating. And this actress, this poor skinny actress who
   obviously lost weight to play the likable lead character, has to say
   things like “Shut up, you guys! I love cheesecake! If I want to eat an
   entire cheesecake, I will!” If you look closely, you can see this
   woman’s ribs through the dress she’s wearing—that’s how skinny she is,
   this cheesecake-loving cow.

   The Woman Who Works in an Art Gallery

   How many freakin’ art galleries are out there? Are people buying visual
   art on a daily basis? This posh/smart/classy profession is a favorite
   in movies. It’s in the same realm as kindergarten teacher or
   children’s-book illustrator in terms of accessibility: guys don’t
   really get it, but it is likable and nonthreatening.

   Art Gallery Woman: “Dust off the Warhol. You know, that Campbell’s Soup
   one in the crazy color! We have an important buyer coming into town,
   and this is a really big deal for my career. I have no time for this!”

   The Gallery Worker character is the rare female movie archetype that
   has a male counterpart. Whenever you meet a handsome, charming,
   successful man in a romantic comedy, the heroine’s friend always says
   the same thing: “He’s really successful. He’s”—say it with me—“an
   architect!”

   There are, like, nine people in the entire world who are architects,
   and one of them is my dad. None of them look like Patrick Dempsey. ♦

What Amazon’s Purchase of Whole Foods Really Means

   By Joshua Rothman

   Behind the scenes, Amazon has been using technology to vertically
   integrate nearly the entire process of consumption.
   Courtesy Amazon / YouTube

   Last week, two days before announcing that it would be acquiring Whole
   Foods, Amazon released a short promotional video for a new product
   called the Dash Wand. The Wand is a candy-bar-size gizmo that costs
   twenty dollars. It sticks to your refrigerator with magnets and lets
   you order products by talking—it features Amazon’s voice assistant,
   Alexa—or by scanning barcodes. In the video, an affluent, middle-aged
   couple drift through their spotless kitchen, preparing for a dinner
   party. The woman peers into the fridge, where she discovers a bag of
   pre-peeled shrimp. She asks the Wand for a simple shrimp-pasta recipe,
   then orders ingredients for it, scanning the barcode of an empty jar of
   pasta sauce and proclaiming, “Mushrooms!” The next day, these items are
   delivered in a cooler bag. While cooking, she uses up the white wine,
   so the man, who’s milling around in the kitchen, tells the Wand, “Order
   white wine from Prime Now.” (Prime Now is Amazon’s same-day delivery
   service.) Shortly before the dinner guests arrive, he says, “Dim lights
   to seventy per cent.” When the other couples materialize, the
   thoroughly unstressed host proposes a toast: “To old friends!”

   There is something horrible about this little video. Why do the
   inhabitants of this suburban home require a recipe for pasta from a
   jar? Why can’t they turn the lights down using their hands? If the ad
   were an episode of “Black Mirror,” they would be clones living in a
   laboratory, attempting to follow the patterns of an outside world
   they’ve never seen. And yet the ad is not fantastical but descriptive.
   It’s unsettling because it’s an accurate portrayal of our new
   mail-order way of life, which Amazon has spent the past twenty-two
   years creating.

   It hasn’t always been obvious that Amazon would transform the feeling
   of everyday life. At first, the company looked like a bookstore; next,
   it became a mass retailer; later, for somewhat obscure reasons, it
   transformed into a television and movie studio. It seemed to be growing
   horizontally, by learning to sell new kinds of products. But Amazon
   wasn’t just getting wider; it was getting deeper, too. It wasn’t just
   selling products but inventing a new method of selling; behind the
   scenes, it was using technology to vertically integrate nearly the
   entire process of consumption. This integration is Amazon’s real
   product. It’s what you purchase when you become a member of Amazon
   Prime. (According to some estimates, eighty million American
   households—more than sixty per cent of the total—have Prime
   memberships.)

   Amazon has created the world’s most efficient order-fulfillment system,
   including a network of warehouses and a delivery arm, Amazon Logistics.
   It has started a shipping subsidiary, Amazon Maritime, to transport
   goods on cargo ships from China to the United States. Netflix, NASA,
   and the C.I.A. are among the million customers who run their systems
   using Amazon’s cloud-computing platform, Amazon Web Services; this
   year, A.W.S. is expected to earn thirteen billion dollars in
   revenue—about as much as the N.F.L. In addition to its own
   point-of-sale devices—the Dash Button, Dash Wand, and Amazon Echo—it
   has created its own in-house advertising ecosystem: television shows
   like “Transparent” may win Emmys, but they also encourage customers to
   sign up for Amazon Prime, and pull them away from traditional
   television, where they might see ads for competing companies, such as
   Walmart. Amazon, in short, is far more than a retailer. It’s like
   Diebold, U.P.S., Target, the CW, I.B.M., and S.A.P. combined.

   Ben Thompson, a technology analyst who writes the blog Stratechery, has
   proposed an extraordinarily useful model for understanding Amazon’s
   reach. He argues that Amazon works by dividing the world of commerce up
   into building blocks, which he calls “primitives.” Some “primitives”
   are business-facing: servers, databases, warehouses, delivery trucks.
   Others are consumer-facing: books, music, clothing, television shows.
   Amazon makes money by allowing its customers to combine these
   primitives in unusually convenient and efficient ways. Using them, it’s
   possible to run a whole company from within the Amazon ecosystem, with
   servers running in Amazon’s cloud and products stored in and shipped
   from its warehouses. Amazon itself launches new businesses using the
   primitives it has mastered. Many people have seen the Whole Foods
   acquisition as a way for Amazon to sell fancier groceries online, while
   using its larger scale and greater efficiency to lower prices. But, in
   Thompson’s view, the acquisition is best understood as giving Amazon
   access to new, grocery-based primitives, such as fruit, vegetables,
   meats, and food-ready warehouses. He suggests that the company will
   launch “Amazon Grocery Services,” a subsidiary that farmers or small
   manufacturers might use to sell, warehouse, and ship their products.
   Restaurants could stock their kitchens with it, too.

   Where will it end? At first, as Amazon added more building blocks to
   its toolkit, the world changed in intangible ways. Ordering got easier;
   packages arrived faster. Lately, though, the physical changes have
   grown more apparent. Already, we spend less time shopping in the
   physical world. Now the disappearance of bookstores seems to be
   extending to retail stores more generally. Grocery stores, too, will
   soon be thinner on the ground. Along with the leaf blower and the
   ice-cream truck, the delivery van, nosing into one driveway after
   another, is now a staple of suburban life.

   It’s increasingly easy to imagine that a few decades from now, we’ll
   tell our kids about how we used to “go to the store”; they’ll look at
   us and say, “What?” Earlier this month, Amazon filed a patent
   application describing large, multi-story drone towers in urban
   centers. Probably, in the future, such buildings will seem
   unremarkable. The hive-like towers will have loading docks and
   warehouses on the lower floors and bays for drones higher up; the
   drones may be repaired and supplied by robots. “There is a growing need
   and desire to locate fulfillment centers within cities, such as in
   downtown districts,” the patent application says. How else would your
   wine beat your guests to the door?

   When David Stinson finished high school, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in
   1977, the first thing he did was get a job building houses. After a few
   years, though, the business slowed. Stinson was then twenty-four, with
   two children to support. He needed something stable. As he explained
   over lunch recently, that meant finding a job at one of the two
   companies in the area that offered secure, blue-collar work. “Either
   I’ll be working at General Motors or I’ll be working at Steelcase by
   the end of the year,” he vowed in 1984. A few months later, he got a
   job at Steelcase, the world’s largest manufacturer of office furniture,
   and he’s been working at its Grand Rapids metal plant ever since.

   Stinson is now fifty-eight. He has a full, reddish face, a thick head
   of silver hair, and a majestic midsection. His navy polo shirt displays
   his job title—“Zone Leader”—and, like everyone else in the plant, he
   always has a pair of protective earplugs on a neon string draped around
   his neck. His glasses have plastic shields on the sides that give him
   the air of a cranky scientist.

   “I don’t regret coming here,” Stinson said. We were sitting in the
   plant’s cafeteria, and Stinson was unwrapping an Italian sub, supplied
   by a deli that every Thursday offers plant workers sandwiches for four
   dollars instead of eight. “There’s been times I’ve thought about
   leaving, but it’s just getting to be a much more comfortable atmosphere
   around here. The technology is really helping that kind of thing, too.
   Instead of taking responsibility away from you, it’s a big aid. It’s
   definitely the wave of the future here.”

   William Sandee, Jr., a sixty-four-year-old worker on the paint line,
   sat down next to Stinson with a carton of fries and a cup of ketchup,
   and tossed his safety goggles on the table. “We try to have some fun
   with it,” he said in a low near-growl. “It can get intense.”

   Sandee, who has neatly combed gray hair and an alert, owlish face,
   began working at Steelcase in 1972, after waiting in line with six
   hundred people just to put in an application. “They made it very
   lucrative to be a Steelcase employee, back in the day,” Sandee said.
   Plant managers were known to drive fancy cars and have second homes on
   the lake; the company paid the college tuition for employees’ children,
   who often spent summers working at the local plants; and there were
   company picnics and a bowling tournament, which once had fifteen
   hundred players. (The tournament is still held, now with around three
   hundred participants.)

   In the nineties, Steelcase employed more than ten thousand workers in
   the United States and operated seven factories around Grand Rapids,
   making chairs, filing cabinets, desks, and tables, and the screws,
   bolts, and casters that went into them. Packed shoulder to shoulder,
   workers polished and painted wood and assembled steel parts by hand.
   Today, there are only two Steelcase plants in Michigan—the metal
   factory, which makes desks and filing cabinets, and a nearby “wood
   plant,” which produces wood furniture. In total, they employ fewer than
   two thousand workers. The company’s only other U.S. plant, in Athens,
   Alabama, employs a thousand full-time workers.

   The history of Steelcase, in many ways, is the history of manufacturing
   in America. The company was founded in 1912 with one product, a
   fireproof metal wastebasket. As the economy boomed in the following
   decades, America’s burgeoning corporations needed to furnish their
   offices with desks and shelving and cubicle walls. “If you were a
   high-school kid growing up in Grand Rapids in the eighties and you
   didn’t want to go to college, and you got a job at a Steelcase factory,
   you were set,” Rob Kirkbride, who covered Steelcase for almost two
   decades at the Grand Rapids Press and industry publications, told me.
   “It was like winning the lottery.”
   “Memoir, Chapter 1. At times, I think I may have never fully gotten
   over the death of my parents . . .”

   Then the dot-com bubble burst and countless startups found themselves
   auctioning off their office furniture. By 2001, Steelcase had lost a
   third of its sales and started closing plants throughout western
   Michigan. Its manufacturing was moved to Mexico, China, and eventually
   India. In 2011, the company announced a new series of closings and
   layoffs, shutting another plant near Grand Rapids, one in Texas, and
   one in Ontario, Canada. Almost all the company’s chair manufacturing
   was relocated to Mexico.

   These days, as U.S. companies report record profits and demand millions
   of sleek new workspaces, Steelcase is again on the upswing. Its
   corporate headquarters, housed in a refurbished factory, is a
   laboratory of workplace trends, with open floor plans and
   glass-sheathed work pods where people recline with their laptops or
   hover at standing desks. In the two Michigan plants that remain open,
   employees create metal components for furniture sets and conference
   tables in dozens of shades of wood veneer.

   As technology is making the work faster, more efficient, and more
   environmentally sound, the products are being created with far fewer
   workers. “Companies are obviously not sending out press releases
   saying, ‘We’re not hiring more people,’ but that’s what I hear on the
   street,” Kirkbride said. There are automated assembly lines, and
   robotic arms lifting tabletops that were once hauled by men. Stinson
   took me across a dense wall of machinery and past a giant contraption
   that makes cardboard boxes so that the plant doesn’t have to order
   them. “You can just punch it into the touch screen there and go, I need
   86-17, boom-boom-boom, I need fourteen of ’em. Hit the button, and it
   cuts it for you,” he said. “That kind of stuff is really cool. So it
   isn’t so much that we’re eliminating jobs, we’re eliminating the
   waste.”

   As a zone leader, Stinson is responsible for about fifteen employees on
   a section of the production line that makes parts for Steelcase’s Ology
   series—height-adjustable tables built for the standing-desk craze.
   Until last year, the plant workers had to consult a long list of steps,
   taking pains to remove the correct parts out of a cart filled with
   variously sized bolts and screws and pins and to insert each one in the
   correct hole and in the correct order. Now computerized workstations,
   called “vision tables,” dictate, step by step, how workers are to
   assemble a piece of furniture. The process is virtually mistake-proof:
   the system won’t let the workers proceed if a step isn’t completed
   correctly. We stood behind a young woman wearing a polo shirt and Lycra
   shorts, with a long blond ponytail. When a step was completed, a light
   turned on above the next required part, accompanied by a
   beep-beep-whoosh sound. A scanner overhead tracked everything as it was
   happening, beaming the data it collected to unseen engineers with
   iPads. Employees who follow a strict automated protocol—some call them
   “meat robots”—need little training. Even the drill was attached to a
   computer-assisted arm; the worker just had to move it to the right
   position and let the machine do its magic. A decade ago, industrial
   robots assisted workers in their tasks. Now workers—those who
   remain—assist the robots in theirs.

   For decades, the conventional view among economists was that
   technological advances create as many opportunities for workers as they
   take away. In the past several years, however, research has begun to
   suggest otherwise. “It’s not that we’re running out of work or jobs per
   se,” David Autor, an M.I.T. economist who studies the impact of
   automation on employment, said. “But a subset of people with low skill
   levels may not be able to earn a reasonable standard of living based on
   their labor. We see that already.” As automation depresses wages, jobs
   in factories become both less abundant and less appealing.

   This process, Autor and other economists argue, can also exacerbate
   inequality. The labor market is built around the idea of labor
   scarcity: each person has a bundle of labor—his or her own capacity to
   work—that employers need and that she can sell in the job market
   through employment during the course of a career of thirty years or so.
   That model is eroding. “It doesn’t mean there’s no money around, but
   it’s just accruing to the owners of capital, to the owners of ideas,”
   Autor says. “And capital is less equitably distributed than labor.
   Everyone is born with some labor, but not everyone is born with
   capital.”

   In the Steelcase metal factory, automation has led the company to seek
   out more highly educated managers, who are now expected to have a
   college degree, not just a high-school diploma. The company, following
   the “lean manufacturing” model pioneered by Toyota, hires young
   engineers to scan factory data for additional “efficiencies,” which can
   translate into further automation. For people who have technical
   degrees and can manage automated systems, and for owners of companies
   that are in the process of automating, the potential for increased
   wealth is significant. But for less skilled workers it’s a different
   story. In a paper from earlier this year, the economists Daron
   Acemoglu, of M.I.T., and Pascual Restrepo, of Boston University,
   studied local job markets in the United States between 1990 and 2007,
   and they found that the concentration of industrial robots in an area
   was directly related to a decline in jobs and in pay. Technology can
   compound the effects of globalization. By one measure, the average
   manufacturing worker in the United States earned nine per cent less in
   2015 than the average worker in 1973, while the economy over all grew
   by two hundred per cent. At Steelcase, Stinson acknowledged, workers
   were earning around the same dollar salary that they had in 1987.

   Neither Stinson nor Sandee thought that automation posed a threat to
   their jobs, though. Sandee remembers when Frank Merlotti, a legendary
   figure at Steelcase who retired as president and C.E.O. in 1990, used
   to visit the plant and deliver rousing speeches to the workers. “Frank
   would look at you, and he would say this before he would even say much
   of anything,” Sandee recalled. “ ‘Listen,’ he says, ‘it’s you people,
   you people, all you people out here who make this thing work, who make
   it happen.’ ”

   Sandee speaks fervently about the dignity of manual labor. He told me
   about a trip he had taken with his grandkids to New York City, where
   they had visited the Empire State Building. “You’ve probably seen that
   picture of those guys, where they’re sitting way up there on all that
   steel, up there, they’re eating their lunch together,” Sandee said.
   “And they got some rivets and stuff there. But the rivets, in my
   opinion, are the people.” He seemed to be describing a famous
   black-and-white photograph titled “Lunch Atop a Skyscraper.” “That was
   one of the nicest things I saw there, of all of New York City, it was
   those old-timers. Building that building. How did they do it, you know?
   It’s amazing.”

   In Sandee’s opinion, there was something irreplaceable about the
   combination of sentient judgment and human hands. Think of all the
   things that robots couldn’t do: get their hands into things; unpack a
   box; close a twist-tie. Even in an automated future, he thought, you’d
   need people to apply the wisdom gained through age and experience.
   “You’re still gonna have to have the people here,” he said. “Somebody’s
   still gotta man that machine that’s supposed to be able to do
   everything. And tell us when that machine doesn’t want to work the way
   it’s supposed to.”

   The Humans to Robots Laboratory, at Brown University, is on the ground
   floor of a red brick building in the center of Providence, Rhode
   Island. It has the feel of an oversized garage, filled with stained,
   lumpy sofas and scattered gadgets and toys, along with the odd takeout
   food carton. There, on a recent afternoon, a robot with bulky red arms
   set about pulling the petals from an artificial daisy. The robot, known
   around the lab as Winnie, held the flower in a pair of rubber-tipped
   pincers, then retracted its other arm, rotated it slightly, and pointed
   it down toward the daisy. It emitted an idling-motor sound, as though
   contemplating what to do next. Then the hand jerked down toward the
   flower, grabbed a petal, and flung it on the table. It retracted again,
   with a mechanical reeeh-raaah! noise. The movements evoked a
   prehistoric bird.

   The lab was created by Stefanie Tellex, a computer-science professor
   who studies ways to create robots that can work coöperatively with
   humans. “Broadly, my research program is about making robots that can
   work with people on complex tasks,” Tellex told me. “We’re trying to
   make robots that can robustly perceive and manipulate the objects in
   their environment.”
   “I can’t wait to introduce you to all the people I used to be friends
   with, before I started spending all my time with you.”

   The word “manipulate” comes up often among roboticists. Even in highly
   automated factories, jobs that involve packing boxes or putting tiny
   parts together are done by people. The most agile robot, confronted
   with an object that it’s never seen before, can pick it up only ninety
   per cent of the time, which isn’t good enough for industrial purposes.

   Solving this problem—teaching a machine to handle a random assortment
   of irregularly shaped objects—would have an immense impact; Tellex
   envisages machines that change diapers and prepare dinner. In her class
   Topics in Collaborative Robotics, one student proposed to teach a robot
   to make a salad. “It’s very difficult, and probably not very cost
   efficient, for a robot to make a salad,” Tellex’s teaching assistant,
   Josh Roy, said. “We joked that we could make a thirty-thousand-dollar
   salad with a robot.” Part of the challenge, whatever the task, is
   devising an “end effector”—the handlike tool at the end of the robot’s
   arm—that can grip a variety of shapes and sizes and textures with
   different levels of pressure. The more complex part, and the part that
   preoccupies Tellex, involves teaching the robot to perceive the
   different objects so that it understands what it’s supposed to do.

   Winnie was programmed by one of Tellex’s students, Rebecca Pankow, a
   first-year Ph.D. candidate with bright brown eyes and dimples. “It’s
   not very refined,” Pankow said, as Winnie continued pulling petals.
   “This is more of a proof of concept.” She went on, “I chose this
   project because I thought it was an interesting computer-vision
   problem. It’s applicable to other things that I work on outside this
   class. And I just thought it was very cute.”

   An industrial robot will pick up the same object, in the same location,
   over and over. The challenge, and the multibillion-dollar business
   opportunity, was to teach a robot to function in an environment that
   was constantly changing. This was Winnie’s assignment. “There’s a
   saying in robotics: Anything a human being can do after age five is
   very easy for a robot,” one of Tellex’s students had said to me
   earlier. “Learn to play chess, no problem. Learn to walk, no way.”

   John Oberlin, another Ph.D. student, who wore a long brown ponytail,
   safety goggles, and sandals with wool socks, bent his tall frame over a
   computer on a side table. The screen showed what Winnie was “seeing”
   through its hand-camera. “If I were going to try and pick up this tape
   over and over”—Oberlin picked up and dropped a roll of masking tape—“it
   only exists in one way, on the table,” he told me. “So I can just
   memorize what it looks like in one way, and then all I have to do is
   search this space, basically. But these petals on this flower have more
   than one way to fall. Sometimes they can be rotated a little bit,
   sometimes they can droop, sometimes they can curve, so these petals are
   deformable. And that makes them inherently harder to localize.”

   Pankow had retrofitted an artificial flower with little magnets on its
   petals, so that they could be reattached and reused. “The camera is
   currently taking a picture of the table,” she said. “And then you put
   the flower there, and it will take the picture again. And it will say,
   ‘Oh, look at the difference between the two—a flower has appeared.’ ”

   Winnie’s arm moved in, clamped its pincers around a petal, plucked it
   off, and then threw it onto the table. It made the reeeh-raaah! noise
   and then went back to idling. The cycle continued until there was only
   one petal left. It was sticking out at an awkward angle, and Winnie’s
   arm hovered for a long time above it. Pankow and Oberlin watched
   nervously.

   Winnie moved in, its arm quivering slightly, and positioned its arm to
   the outside of the flower in a way that looked unlikely to succeed. The
   grippers opened, trying but failing to close around the petal. Then the
   arm pulled up again. Reeeh-raaah!

   Oberlin adjusted the flower. “I bet it comes down a little bit . . .”
   he said. This time, Winnie managed to peel off the final petal.

   Pankow and Oberlin spoke about the adjustments that would have to be
   made for the technology to be usable in the real world. “You can
   imagine this ability to classify or examine plants or other structures
   in terms of their parts, in order to compose or localize each one of
   those petals—that has applications in actual industry,” Oberlin said.
   “You can imagine applying that modelling technique to real plants.”

   “Blueberries,” Tellex said quietly, leaning against the window. “That’s
   my goal. People aren’t going to pay us to take petals off of daisies.
   But they will pay us to pick blueberries.” She looked down at the table
   and the bare daisy stem. “Did it just pick all of these? In order? This
   is awesome. This is not something I’ve ever seen a robot do. And that’s
   cool. And now we’ve figured some things out, as a result of doing
   this.”

   Harvesting fruit and other produce, which involves hours under the hot
   sun, is the kind of job that Americans are increasingly reluctant to do
   and that often goes to low-paid immigrant labor. Yet the implications
   extend beyond agriculture. A robot that could efficiently pick
   blueberries could probably do a lot of things that are currently the
   exclusive province of human beings. Potentially, it could advance on a
   frontier challenge of industrial robotics—not only picking a wallet out
   of a bin but riffling through it and pulling out a credit card.

   “I usually like to ask the question: How can this help make society
   better?” Tellex said. “What is something that people do now that robots
   might do?”

   Corporate executives want to know the answer to that question, but they
   seldom ask it publicly. Automation is a topic that gets treated with
   enormous diplomacy, both in Europe and in the United States. The Dutch
   supermarket chain Ahold Delhaize, which owns the Stop & Shop and Peapod
   grocery-store brands in the U.S., hopes to have all its retail outlets
   cleaned by robots within five years. Although the company was not eager
   to publicize the details of the venture, the images that spring to mind
   are part Isaac Asimov and part Dr. Seuss—doors closing with a thud and
   the aisles bursting to life, with metallic objects scampering across
   the floor, brightly colored squeegees and sponges dropping from the
   ceiling, followed by an explosion of soapsuds and baby carrots. But the
   goal wasn’t to replace human workers, a company spokesperson insisted.
   With store-cleaning robots, “our associates in our stores will have
   more time for customers.”

   Such initiatives aren’t limited to private businesses; neither are the
   sensitivities. In southern Denmark, the regional government hired a
   chief robotics officer, Poul Martin Møller, to help integrate more
   robots into the public sector, largely as a money-saving measure. He
   decided that the Danish hospital system, which was under pressure to
   reduce costs, could benefit from robotic orderlies. There were few
   medical-oriented robots on the market, though, so Møller and his team
   took small, mobile robots with movable arms, designed for use in
   warehouses, and refashioned them, so that they could carry supplies to
   doctors and nurses. The machines worked well, scuttling through surgery
   wings and psych wards like helpful crabs, never complaining or taking
   cigarette breaks. But Møller wasn’t prepared for the reaction of the
   hospital staff, who recognized their mechanical colleagues as potential
   replacements, and tried to sabotage them. Fecal matter and urine were
   left in charging stations.

   Since then, Møller has evangelized about “change management,” and the
   need to handle people carefully as new technology is introduced. “As a
   taxpayer, here we pay thirty-three, thirty-four dollars an hour for
   unskilled work, like orderlies,” he told me. “Robots cost, at most,
   around ninety-five cents an hour. If you do the math, you can have
   thirty-five robots for one human. So you might as well face reality and
   face facts. That means you have a bunch of orderlies who need jobs.” By
   way of redress, he proposes using the robot-derived savings, at least
   initially, to retrain the displaced humans for more sophisticated jobs
   that the robots can’t (yet) do.

   In the United States, where automation in the workplace is no less
   politically fraught, corporate executives are reluctant to be quoted on
   the subject; when they are, their usual line is that robots aren’t
   replacing humans but simply helping to make their jobs less taxing.
   This is not entirely a misrepresentation. When I asked Dave Stinson and
   his colleagues at Steelcase about how automation had affected the
   assembly line, they said, for the most part, that it had made things
   easier. The factory was cleaner, less noisy, more productive. When
   something went wrong with the assembly, they could diagnose the problem
   swiftly, by consulting the data. Most workers welcomed being rotated
   through different positions, rather than doing the same thing for years
   at a time.

   The work placed less stress on their bodies, too. At one time,
   twenty-five hundred steel tabletops came off the assembly line each
   day, requiring two men to sweat and strain to get each one into the
   right place; now a robotic arm with grippers moved the tops.
   Workers—the ones who had survived the economic downturns, offshoring,
   and technological changes—had an easier time than ever before. In the
   old days, Stinson said, “It was, How much longer am I going to be able
   to do this? That’s kind of a question that you would always ask—how
   much longer can I hold up doing this, physically just holding up?
   Ergonomically, the difference today is huge. Huge.” Now he could work
   longer without burning out, and the work was easier. Who could complain
   about that?

   Automation has also increased the amount of manufacturing in the United
   States, by making it more efficient. The most immediate way that it
   makes manufacturing more efficient, of course, is by requiring fewer
   workers. Still, when manufacturing that has been sent overseas comes
   back, it brings some jobs back, too, even if they are not the same
   complement of jobs, and not in their old numbers. Last year, for the
   first time in decades, the number of Americans employed in
   manufacturing increased—more jobs returned or were created than
   left—and automation-enabled “reshoring” is a big reason for that.

   In a hundred-and-twenty-five-thousand-square-foot factory in the town
   of Hatfield, Pennsylvania, forty-five minutes north of Philadelphia,
   dozens of giant, automated industrial presses loom over a cement
   landscape. They belong to the Rodon Group, one of the largest
   family-owned injection-molding companies in the country. Founded in
   1956, the company makes millions of high-end plastic parts each year:
   containers for cosmetics, caps, pushpin heads, bottle tops.

   One of Rodon’s subsidiaries was a “construction toy” company—comparable
   to Lego and Fischertechnik—called K’Nex. The K’Nex line had been
   invented by the son of the Rodon Group’s founder, and, in the late
   nineteen-nineties and early two-thousands, it was run by a former
   Hasbro executive. Hasbro, like most of the American toy industry, had
   moved its production to China, and the executive decided to do the same
   thing with K’Nex. There were trade-offs with outsourcing: quality
   control was less reliable, and it was harder to respond nimbly to
   changing customer demands in the trend-driven toy business. But the
   savings were dramatic; on average, it cost less than half as much to
   make a product in China as it did in the United States.

   Michael Araten, the current C.E.O. of K’Nex Brands and the
   grandson-in-law of Rodon’s founder, told me that business had been
   relatively stable until the financial crisis arrived, and sales
   plunged. Rodon laid off around forty people, about a third of its
   workforce. Araten said that when business picked up the discussion
   quickly turned to how the company could rehire those people. One
   obvious solution presented itself: K’Nex could bring its manufacturing
   back to the United States so long as it could remain price-competitive
   with the China-sourced toy companies. K’Nex managers concluded that
   reshoring was feasible, but they would have to automate as much of the
   process as possible.

   On a recent visit, the plant’s manufacturing floor was filled with the
   sound of molding presses clamping down with as much as four hundred
   tons of pressure. No people were visible. Most of the presses work
   twenty-four hours a day, drawing plastic resin into a hopper, heating
   it to six hundred degrees Fahrenheit, and then blasting the liquid into
   molds, which are enormous blocks of stainless steel,
   precision-fabricated in an adjacent tool shop to create the shape of
   the desired part. (The molds used to be hand-fashioned by
   tool-and-die-makers, who were considered artisans; now a series of
   programmable robots do most of the job.) Automated arms lift the parts
   up to cool, before depositing them in boxes. The completed parts are
   bright orange, purple, and red, and resemble dime-store candies. Once
   the boxes are full, human workers replace them, and wheel the full ones
   away to be shipped out to their customers.

   A twenty-five-year-old “automation tech” named John Wilson had been
   hired to help integrate robotics into the plant as it moved toward
   increasing automation. Wilson is pale and thin, with glasses and a dark
   beard; he speaks in a low monotone, and gives the sense of someone who
   is more comfortable interacting with screens than with people. The
   child of two accountants, Wilson completed a mechanical-engineering
   degree at Philadelphia University in 2014, and said that he had sought
   out a manufacturing job where he could work directly with different
   types of automated machines. The Rodon Group had obliged. During
   Wilson’s three years at the company, twenty-four new automated presses
   have been introduced. There was a time when a plant worker was
   dedicated to each press, shovelling in plastic polymers, pulling the
   cranks and pushing the buttons, and scooping out the finished products
   and loading them onto trucks. Now, Wilson explained, one operator
   manages between eight and ten presses, which are overseen by digital
   systems. As at Steelcase, the robots have reduced accidents. When I
   asked if there were any jobs in the plant that automated machines
   couldn’t do, Wilson thought for a moment and said, “Cleaning up the
   floor after these machines, and machine-tending.”

   By installing robots and controlling its payroll and other costs, the
   company has been able to make ninety per cent of its parts and products
   in the United States—a move that Araten likes to describe as “patriotic
   capitalism.” Rodon and K’Nex use their made-in-the-U.S.A. credentials
   in their marketing. President Obama visited the Hatfield plant in 2012;
   Hillary Clinton stopped by in 2016. “The choice of how you spend your
   money really matters,” Araten said. “If you buy stuff from an American
   farmer or manufacturer, you’re helping an American family.”

   Sitting in a company conference room that was lined with shelves
   displaying plastic toys and framed vintage production orders from the
   nineteen-fifties, Araten said, “I talk to C.E.O.s all the time who say,
   ‘It’s not my job to worry about the rest of the country.’ And I say,
   ‘Well, whose job is it? You’ve got to do what you can in the United
   States to keep the United States strong.’ ” He went on, “If you think
   there is a benefit to having a stable citizenry that has good-paying
   jobs, that can support a family, you need to be willing to make some
   trade-offs there. Our responsibility is, yes, to our shareholders but
   also to our employees, and to our community. We made a decision—we are
   willing to make less of a profit in order to keep jobs here.”

   Araten acknowledged that, relative to sales, the Hatfield factory
   employed fewer people than it had done in the past. (Rodon’s revenue
   has grown by an average of fifteen per cent over each of the past five
   years, while its staffing has increased much more modestly.) But the
   jobs that they do have and will have, he said, will be higher skilled
   and better paying. He argued that the government could encourage
   similar moves by other companies, through tax policy and major
   investments in education, while also preparing for the coming
   technological changes. Still, even Araten isn’t immune from the call of
   high finance: last year, he and the rest of the family decided to sell
   K’Nex to a Chinese-French private-equity firm, Cathay Capital. It is
   unclear whether his new partners will be aligned, over the long term,
   with his people-before-profit philosophy.

   “The winds are changing,” Araten said. “I think part of the reason
   populism is rising around the world is that the gap is getting too big.
   Having so much inequality creates instability in a country. Maybe
   twenty years ago, we still had too many poor people, but they believed
   that they had a shot. I believe some of that is being sucked away.”

   Manufacturing jobs now account for less than ten per cent of the
   American workforce. As plants have closed, displaced employees have
   sought work in fast-food restaurants or in big-box retail stores, where
   the pay and the benefits are substantially less attractive. And,
   increasingly, even those jobs are fading away. Storefront retail is
   fast losing ground to the online marketplace. McDonald’s is introducing
   “digital ordering kiosks” that are expected to replace human cashiers
   at fifty-five hundred restaurants by the end of 2018. Meanwhile,
   companies like Uber and Google are investing heavily in
   autonomous-driving technology, betting that such vehicles will reshape
   transportation. In August, 2016, Uber purchased Otto, a startup based
   in San Francisco that sells technology designed to automate long-haul
   trucking. There are nearly two million long-distance truck drivers in
   the United States, most of whom are male and lack a college degree;
   paying for them accounts for a third of the costs in the
   seven-hundred-billion-dollar trucking industry. Construction jobs, too,
   are threatened by automation; a New York-based firm has introduced a
   laser-guided system that can lay eight hundred to twelve hundred bricks
   a day, more than twice as many as an average mason.

   For low-skilled workers, warehouse jobs have seemed to be something of
   a bright spot. Even if fewer people are required to staff a Target or a
   Sam’s Club outlet, the movement of products requires a network of
   warehouses to store and ship goods. Amazon—the world’s largest online
   retailer—currently has more than ninety thousand employees at its U.S.
   distribution centers, and plans to hire tens of thousands more. Workers
   still do the “picking” in a warehouse, using their dexterous fingers
   and discerning brains to take soap and coffee and tubes of toothpaste
   and millions of other products off the shelves and put them into boxes
   to fulfill the online shopping orders that make up an increasing
   portion of consumers’ buying patterns.

   But the same factors that make warehouses a draw for labor have made
   them a tempting target for automation. In 2012, Amazon spent almost
   eight hundred million dollars to buy a robotics company called Kiva,
   which makes robots that can zoom around a factory floor and move tall
   stacks of shelves of up to seven hundred and fifty pounds in weight. A
   Deutsche Bank research report estimated that Amazon could save
   twenty-two million dollars a year by introducing the Kiva machines in a
   single warehouse; the savings company-wide could reach into the
   billions. With such a powerful incentive, Amazon is on a quest to
   acquire or develop systems that can replace human pickers. When, in
   June, it announced plans to buy the Whole Foods supermarket chain,
   speculation quickly spread that the company intended to automate the
   grocer’s food-distribution centers as well as its stores.

   Simply automating a legacy warehouse, however, is a halfway measure, as
   a visit to Symbotic makes clear. A privately held company based in an
   industrial park outside Boston, it sells fully automated warehouse
   systems to large retail chains, and the new warehouses resemble the old
   ones about as much as a Tesla resembles a Model T. The company’s
   twenty-thousand-square-foot test center is a giant cube of interlocking
   green, yellow, and white steel shelving, tracks, and cages that extend
   from the floor almost to the ceiling. There are no aisles for lifts to
   pass through, and no stations for human product pickers. There is no
   space inside the matrix for people at all.

   Robotic arms unpack pallets of tomato sauce, salsa, toilet paper, and
   soda, and place them on a blue conveyor belt, where they are carried
   deep into the storage cage. A fleet of little green robots that look
   like race cars in a Pixar film come to life and zoom inside the cage on
   dedicated tracks, emitting high-pitched whirring sounds. They collect
   the cases of products and stash them on shelves until they are needed.
   Then an algorithm directs the little car-bots to go back in and bring
   the desired products out.

   “This absolutely reinvents the warehouse,” Chris Gahagan, Symbotic’s
   C.E.O., said as he showed me around. He is a muscular fellow with
   dirty-blond hair pulled back in a ponytail, and looks as if he could
   have had an alternate career leading tourists on spelunking trips
   through Belize. “Now you can build an even smaller warehouse, or carry
   more skus, or serve more stores out of the same warehouse. It gives you
   huge flexibility.”

   Gahagan was recruited in 2015 by Symbotic’s owner, Richard B. Cohen,
   the press-shy billionaire owner of the C&S grocery wholesaler. Cohen
   had wanted a system that would make his grocery warehouses more
   efficient; then he realized that he could make a business of selling it
   to other retailers. Symbotic says it now has more orders than it can
   swiftly fulfill. The automated system, Gahagan notes, produces more
   efficiencies than are obvious at first glance. Because it can store
   more products in a smaller space, companies could have more compact
   warehouses closer to their retail outlets, requiring less trucking. The
   robots don’t need light to operate, so the warehouse could use, Gahagan
   estimated, thirty-five per cent less energy than a conventional one,
   while reducing labor costs by eighty per cent. Many warehouse operators
   run their businesses based on labor hours, in order to minimize
   overtime pay, among other things. But an automated system could run
   twenty-four hours a day. A typical system costs around fifty million
   dollars to install, Gahagan said—not an insignificant investment. But,
   he maintained, it would pay for itself, on average, in four and a half
   years.

   We walked past a “Safety Is Our First Priority” sign on the wall, an
   artifact from a time when there might have been frequent worker
   injuries in such a place, and clambered up a set of steel stairs. All
   around us, machines were moving, gracefully and tirelessly executing
   their tasks.
   “Folks, if that’s not government interference I don’t know what is.”

   “You start to look at all the costs that you can avoid,” he told me.
   “It’s phenomenal. So, as soon as one company does this, it makes it
   more competitive.” That instantly puts pressure on competitors to
   follow suit. “You can’t just sit there being that inefficient,” Gahagan
   went on. “Your assortment in your store is not as good, you’re paying
   more for labor, more for trucking. If a new startup came along in
   retail, it would start with this.” He gestured around at the cavernous,
   chilly space.

   The most important human job at a Symbotic warehouse is that of the
   “system operator,” which is akin to a job in flight operations, where
   you sit all day behind a bank of screens and make sure that
   everything’s working right. A couple of human workers were needed—for
   now—to help unload and load the trucks as they came and went with the
   inventory, and four or so mechanics were kept on staff to service the
   bots when they needed it (because “shit happens”). In all, the average
   system requires eight or nine people per shift, a fraction of what a
   traditional warehouse requires.

   Most jobs in warehouses are undesirable and hard to fill, Gahagan
   assured me. A typical worker might lift thousands of pounds of goods
   each day and walk the equivalent of a marathon, five or six days a
   week. It could be freezing in the winter, and sweltering during the
   summer months. “Their turnover is huge,” he said. With the robotic
   version, one higher-skilled person sits behind a console and types in
   commands, and is paid almost twice as much per hour as a manual laborer
   would be.

   Gahagan was reluctant to talk about Symbotic’s customers, who aren’t
   keen to draw attention to their interest in nearly human-free warehouse
   systems. “There is some sensitivity, given our . . . political
   situation,” he said. “It’s just a reality of the times that we live
   in.” But the Wall Street Journal has reported that Target is trying a
   Symbotic warehouse and that Walmart has installed several. Gahagan
   allowed that what he called the “red” cola giant—Coca-Cola—is using two
   Symbotic distribution centers. (“It was tricky with the unions, but
   they’ve made it work.”) Now, he said, Coke’s main competitor, the “blue
   one”—Pepsi—wanted to try the system.

   “If someone can start a warehouse with automation and sell for less,
   everyone else has to follow,” Gahagan said. “Consumers buy on price, so
   the cost on the supply chain matters. Walmart, it made a very efficient
   supply chain and that’s why it was able to offer the lowest prices in
   its stores, so everyone else had to compete. And now you’re seeing that
   happen with automation.”

   He observed that technological innovation has been happening in one way
   or another for a hundred years. Tractors replaced manual plows, but we
   were now able to produce much more food, he said; A.T.M.s replaced
   tellers, but banks still employ hundreds of thousands of people.
   “Imagine placing a phone call when you had to have someone place a wire
   into a socket for you,” he said. “Being on a switchboard—those were
   good jobs. Every time technology has evolved, yes, individual people
   are impacted. . . . But the standard of living has gone up. I’d rather
   be in the world we’re in today than a world without computers, without
   cell phones, a world without elevators.”

   We walked onto a platform where we could see a track on which the
   mobile robots were lined up, waiting to be called into action.
   Occasionally, one of them would whirr its motor and blast off, like a
   little rocket. Gahagan looked down on his robot army with affection and
   awe. “Depending on who’s in the White House next, you get to the
   fifteen-dollars-an-hour labor or twenty dollars an hour?” Gahagan said.
   “I’m voting for a thirty-dollar-an-hour minimum wage. That’d be
   fantastic marketing for us.”

   If the fully automated warehouse was a structurally different entity
   from its precursors, what about the fully automated factory? Gahagan
   had pointed out that other countries were embracing industrial robotics
   more aggressively than the United States was. I saw the scale of this
   during a recent trip to China. One steamy afternoon, I boarded a bus in
   downtown Shanghai and headed south along the Huangpu River, far from
   the city’s noodle shops and glittering luxury fashion emporiums. About
   half an hour later, I reached a vast, low building, where hundreds of
   bicycles were parked in a covered lot. Inside, I was greeted by Gerry
   Wong, the C.E.O. of Cambridge Industries Group, which manufactures
   telecommunications equipment—more than three million items a month—for
   companies such as Huawei, Nokia, and Alcatel-Lucent. Wong grew up in
   Beijing, studied electrical engineering at M.I.T., and worked at Bell
   Labs for fifteen years. He started C.I.G. in 2005, and says that the
   company produces between two and three million products each month. He
   has the air of an excitable gnome, with a mop of black hair, thick
   seventies-style eyeglasses, and a wicked laugh.

   Wong sat with his back to a wall of dozens of screens, which depicted
   various production metrics and live video of the manufacturing floor,
   where workers—and an increasing number of robots—were fabricating
   circuit boards. (I was there on a trip with a nonprofit called the
   China-U.S. Exchange Foundation.) He quickly demonstrated the lack of
   sentimentality with which many businesspeople in China approach the
   subject of automation. C.I.G. is trying to replace as many human
   workers with robots as possible, he explained. Three or so years ago,
   the company had thirty-five hundred people at work in the factory. Two
   years ago, it was twenty-five hundred. Today, it is eighteen hundred.
   Over the same period, he said proudly, the company’s output had
   doubled.

   “China’s labor costs are increasing, or doubling, every few years,”
   Wong explained. “We are actually overcoming the difficulty by
   increasing our efficiency, through automation.” For Chinese businesses,
   Wong said, lean manufacturing must include industrial automation, and
   they couldn’t make it happen fast enough.

   Much of China’s economic power during the past two decades came from
   its position as the manufacturing engine of the world, but in the past
   several years its growth has started to slow. China was never a
   particularly convenient place for Western companies to have their
   sneakers and T-shirts and widgets made; the main allure was cheap
   labor. With Chinese wages increasing sharply every year, though,
   manufacturing there has become less attractive, and the Chinese
   government is devoting enormous resources to making the country the
   automation capital of the world.

   As we put on gowns, hairnets, and cloth shoe covers in preparation for
   entering the clean manufacturing area, Wong elaborated on China’s need
   for swift automation. There was a labor shortage, he said, exacerbated
   by the longstanding one-child policy. And, as the population has become
   wealthier and the cost of living higher, fewer people were willing to
   do manufacturing work.
   “Try to ignore the hot-dog smell.”

   “We are pushing all industries to go to all automation,” Wong said. And
   the employees seemed compliant. “Probably they don’t care very much,
   not like back in the industrial revolution, in Europe, where they would
   go and destroy machines. That was the old days.”

   “They leave, anyway,” Rose Hu, a brisk, blunt woman who works as
   C.I.G.’s senior vice-president of marketing, said. “Every Chinese New
   Year, almost eighty per cent of the people, they will not come back.
   You have to have new.”

   We passed through a pressurized air lock that blasted away whatever
   dust or lint we had on our persons, and entered the clean part of the
   plant. Rows of orderly white machines, tended by workers wearing what
   looked like chef’s hats, were moving circuit boards through the
   assembly line. Robotic arms, behind windows, were doing most of the
   work, while the mortals did tasks that required fine motor skills, like
   plugging tiny components into place. Every now and then, a cute little
   robotic trolley came ambling down an aisle, playing Mozart to alert the
   humans that it was approaching. (Until recently, most industrial robots
   were separated from human workers by steel cages, to protect the
   workers from injury. Now robots that can work alongside humans without
   harming them have come into use.) Two workers hovered at a workstation
   and jammed connectors into holes in a line of circuit boards before
   sending them into a glassed-in chamber, where robotic arms soldered the
   pieces together.

   “There were thirteen people doing this. Now we have only one or two,”
   Hu said, gesturing at the two workers, one man and one woman, both
   young adults. “Before, we used people to solder. We used to have
   sixty-three people to finish one thing, and as of last year we need
   only sixteen people.”

   The circuit boards continued down an automated conveyor belt. Other
   robots placed stickers on boxes, before a group of humans moved in to
   place the circuit boards in the boxes, along with packing materials.
   “Closing the box—this is for some reason hard to automate,” Hu said,
   shaking her head.

   Each time I asked about what happened to the displaced workers, Hu and
   Wong waved away the question, amused at the predictable direction of my
   inquiries. Hu insisted that factory workers would simply find another
   place in the economy, such as the service sector. “We already went
   through several industrial revolutions—and we still have a job!” she
   said. “I think it’s people who haven’t lived through the industrial
   revolution who don’t understand this. The world changes. You constantly
   have to improve yourself to keep up.”

   Later, back in the room with the surveillance monitors, Wong gave me a
   slide show on the history of industrial revolutions. The first phase
   began around 1800, in Wong’s rendering, when the steam engine came into
   use, and was based in Britain, France, and Germany. The second phase,
   in 1900, saw the advent of electricity, and was centered in the U.S.,
   the U.K., and Germany. The third was the information-technology
   revolution, beginning in 2000 and concentrated largely in the U.S.,
   Germany, Japan, and Korea. Wong’s point was that China intended to be
   at the forefront of the fourth phase, which would center on integrating
   robotics and artificial intelligence. Finally, he put up a slide that
   said “The future: ‘Dark Factory.’ ”

   “You don’t need workers, you turn off the lights,” Wong explained,
   chuckling. “Only when an American journalist comes in we turn on the
   light.”

   Stefanie Tellex, the roboticist at Brown University, grew up in a
   conservative Catholic family in a suburb of Rochester that abuts Lake
   Ontario, where, she says, “everyone’s got a house and a yard, and
   there’s no crime.” Her father was an accountant; her mother taught
   second grade in downtown Rochester. Tellex became interested in
   computers as a child. Her father gave her an old DOS 486 when she was
   in grade school; her aunt, a programmer, supplied books of simple
   coding exercises. Tellex was admitted to M.I.T. and planned to pursue a
   liberal-arts degree, but her mother told her that liberal-arts
   graduates didn’t make any money. (“One of the best pieces of advice
   I’ve ever gotten.”) She completed her computer-science Ph.D. there in
   2010. She said that “The Jetsons,” the sixties-era animated TV series,
   helped spark her interest in robots.

   “When I think of A.I., that’s what I think of, the robot,” she said.
   “There’s a scene where they’re drinking smoothies together, the mom and
   the robot, who has a relationship with the family, but on the show
   she’s a servant. And she can do everything you can do.”

   After Winnie completed its petal-plucking tasks in Tellex’s lab, we sat
   down in her office. She told me that she had never thought about the
   political implications of her field until the tense months leading up
   to the 2016 Presidential election. Her parents were Trump voters, and
   she found herself disagreeing with them about what the causes of
   society’s ills were, and what the best solutions might be. She was
   alarmed by the anti-immigrant sentiment emanating from Trump’s rallies,
   especially having spent her adult life surrounded by researchers from
   all over the world. Economic inequality was a driving theme of the
   election, and Tellex began to see that automation was a contributing
   factor. The economy was generating wealth, but almost all of it seemed
   to be going to the wealthy. The official unemployment rate has dropped
   to 4.2 per cent in the United States—its lowest level in ten years—and
   the economy is expanding, but wages for most workers have scarcely
   budged.

   In 2015, the Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton identified
   a surprising data pattern that reflects these economic fault lines,
   finding that mortality rates for middle-aged white non-Hispanic
   Americans with only a high-school diploma have been increasing since
   the late nineteen-nineties. They attribute this trend to “deaths of
   despair” tied to the long-term loss of economic opportunity,
   particularly blue-collar jobs, and to possibly related factors such as
   opioid abuse. Deaton listed globalization, immigration, and
   technological change as likely factors behind the decline of
   middle-income workers and the related rise in inequality, but noted
   that, in the developed world, stagnant wages and an associated increase
   in death rates were unique to the United States. “The political
   explanation is the one that seems to make most sense,” he told me. What
   does he worry about if these trends continue? “How about pitchforks?”
   Deaton said, laughing awkwardly. “I mean, I don’t think this is stable
   politically. The Trump thing is probably just the beginning.”
   “One day, I will catch the koi fish that nibbled my left leg.”

   Tellex has been conducting her own research into the causes of income
   inequality and, with her friends, has amassed a reading list of
   academic studies and news articles. She is drawn to the idea of a
   universal basic income, in which citizens would receive enough money
   from the government to cover living expenses. Ultimately, she knows,
   blue-collar workers are not the only ones who may need such economic
   assistance. The disruption spurred by automation is not anticipated to
   be limited to low-skilled work; significant encroachments are expected
   in the white-collar sector as well, with experts predicting that
   professionals such as accountants, doctors, lawyers, architects,
   teachers, and journalists will all compete with increasingly capable
   computers in the future.

   There were ways, Tellex believed, to mitigate the effects of rising
   inequality without vilifying immigrants or blaming technology. “I’m one
   of the few people among my friends who regularly talks to Trump
   voters,” she said. “There’s enough money for everyone, I keep telling
   them—there is. It’s just not in your pocket, it’s in the one per cent’s
   pocket. If only we had the right progressive tax system, this wouldn’t
   be such a problem. As a roboticist, I feel a responsibility to
   communicate this to people.”

   For twenty years, Steelcase’s Corporate Development Center was housed
   in a futuristic pyramid-shaped building, which cost more than a hundred
   million dollars to build. It became a landmark of the Grand Rapids
   area; employees returning home from business trips would proudly make
   note of it as their flights descended into the Gerald R. Ford Airport.
   In 2009, in the midst of the financial crisis, Steelcase moved out of
   the building. It sat vacant until 2016, when a company called Switch
   moved in. Switch is a third-party data center, and plans to house giant
   servers there for companies like Disney and eBay.

   Dave Stinson, at Steelcase, told me that he often became emotional when
   he saw the building, and was reminded of what it represented. “It’s
   especially cool at night, when the lights are on,” he said, as a loud
   beeping forklift sound echoed in the background. “I’m getting
   sentimental. It’s a monument for our city. There was talk that they
   were going to tear it down. That would have been a huge loss.”

   After decades on the factory floor, he’s seen enough workers laid off
   to know something about losses. Bill Sandee, his colleague, tries to
   put those losses in perspective. “It was rough to see some of them
   leave,” he told me, referring to the waves of laid-off colleagues.
   “Some of them, their jobs were being eliminated because they just
   didn’t have enough work. And the company has to do something to
   survive. But it’s hard not to take it personally when you’re losing
   your job. You have to go home and tell your wife and kids, ‘I’m out of
   work.’ I remember one engineer saying, ‘I won’t be seeing you anymore,
   Bill, I just got RIF’d.’ It didn’t feel very good.” He paused. “Let’s
   face it, if you love somebody, you care about ’em. So many things in
   our lives are out of our control.”

   That didn’t feel very good, either. Stinson described the time, months
   before the Presidential election, when a friend asked him which
   candidate he was supporting, and he said, “I’m not voting for another
   Bush, and I’m not voting for another Clinton. Period.” The night before
   the election, he and his wife attended a Trump rally in Grand Rapids,
   in the heart of a state that Hillary Clinton had expected to win
   comfortably. More than four thousand people lined up for blocks to hear
   Trump at a downtown convention center. Stinson said he decided that
   night to vote for the Republican ticket. “The way I voted was based on
   the idea that we’re not losing jobs anymore, we’re not doing the NAFTA
   thing,” he said. “I hope he fulfills what he was trying to do when he
   was campaigning and it’s not going to be all broken promises.”

   He was accustomed to politicians disappointing him. Robots hadn’t yet.
   Stinson used to spend his days reminding workers of what they were
   supposed to be doing, or trying to figure out how faulty parts had
   sneaked into the system. He used to jump in and demonstrate precisely
   how a screw was supposed to go in, or whether the torque was correct.
   Now none of that was necessary. Automated machines were driving
   everything. “As opposed to having to train, train, train, train, train,
   making sure you’re getting the muscle memory right,” he said. “It was
   hard, it was stinky, it was ‘I gotta check everything.’ ”

   Back when the factory floor was thick with workers, they used to
   bicker, and Stinson says he was constantly dealing with the drama of
   their personal lives—there were illnesses and feuds and car accidents.
   No longer. The crews are thin; the pressure is less. The youngest of
   his three sons, aged thirty, works in a different department at the
   Steelcase plant. He had dropped out of college, hit hard by his
   grandfather’s death at sixty-five, and Stinson said he had encouraged
   him to go back to school or go into plastics. Still, he said, “He’s
   happy here.”

   Stinson says he is, too. He explained that his line’s productivity had
   shot way up—from a hundred and fifty desk legs a day a year ago to an
   average of eight hundred a day, and growing—which made him feel good.
   “That’s a lot of butts in a lot of seats,” he said. When I asked how
   many new workers Steelcase had hired to accommodate the increase in
   production, he said that workers were mainly being moved between
   production lines, to replace workers who had retired. The company was
   about to install two more automated workstations, though, to
   “accommodate this and future growth.”

   He gazed out at the smoothly functioning factory floor, the rows of
   machines diving and pecking in front of their human minders, performing
   a kind of dance. Even if the economy stayed strong and demand remained
   high the head count was expected to decline through attrition, year
   after year. “It’s got all the technology that you could possibly think
   of,” Stinson told me, when he showed me the vision table. “Until next
   week, when we find something else that we could change to make it
   better.” Automation was bringing greater and greater efficiency, even
   though, at a certain point, the logic of increasing efficiency would
   catch up with him, and he wouldn’t be around any longer to witness it.
   One day, the factory might go dark. In the meantime, he was enjoying
   the advantages of work that involved less work.

   “There were times when I thought I could do something else besides
   this, you know?” he said. “I really like the job a lot better than it
   was. Now I don’t feel overwhelmed anymore.” ♦

   An earlier version of this article misstated the monetary value of the
   trucking industry in the United States.
   This article appears in the print edition of the October 23, 2017,
   issue, with the headline “Dark Factory.”

Amazon’s New Supermarket Could Be Grim News for Human Workers

   Will the technology in Amazon’s new automated grocery store, Amazon Go,
   in Seattle, put millions of retail employees out of work someday?
   Photograph by Stephen Brashear / Getty

   When Amazon announced, in June, that it was buying Whole Foods, for
   $13.7 billion, speculation arose about what, exactly, the world’s
   biggest online retailer planned to do with the high-end supermarket
   chain. Amazon had taken steps to enter the business of selling fresh
   food, but it was far from the company’s areas of expertise. Some noted
   that Amazon was, and continues to be, one of the most aggressive
   investors in robotics and artificial-intelligence technology. Six years
   ago, Amazon purchased Kiva, a company that produces mobile robots that
   would make it easier to automate Amazon’s distribution centers,
   potentially saving the company billions of dollars. It seemed obvious
   at the time of the Whole Foods takeover that Amazon could try to
   automate the supermarket chain as well. With the opening this week, in
   Seattle, of the first automated Amazon grocery store, called Amazon Go,
   Jeff Bezos’s vision for the future of the retail industry is fully on
   display—and it’s a vision that involves very few actual human workers.
   What Bezos has created has implications for economists, employers, and
   policymakers, and will surely fuel the debate about automation and the
   future of work.

   As I reported in The New Yorker in October, automation has been
   spreading throughout manufacturing industries around the world,
   introducing technology into assembly lines to take on some of the most
   physically taxing and repetitive work. Robots are often designed to
   initially make human workers’ jobs less stressful and more efficient,
   until the technology evolves to the point at which the roles almost
   reverse. Eventually, the humans are simply helping the machines to
   execute nearly all tasks, sometimes hovering in the background in case
   they break down. At some point after that, the human workers may not be
   needed at all, or at least not in the same ways they have been.

   Retail stores, with their unpredictable physical environments and
   constant customer interactions, by contrast, were seen as far more
   difficult than manufacturing to automate. “Retail is delayed in terms
   of high-tech automation,” Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T. who
   studies automation and the labor market, told me. “You’ve had the more
   clerical parts that have already been automated, such as cashiers and
   so on, but a lot of other areas, such as grocery stores and malls,
   they’re behind manufacturing in terms of introduction of robots,
   because the tasks performed by people there are often more complex.”
   Instead of repeatedly spraying paint onto car-body parts or drilling
   holes into pieces of steel, retail workers are often assisting
   shoppers, answering questions, or restocking shelves. “It’s somewhat
   harder,” Acemoglu said. “At the moment, and probably fortunately, it’s
   not going to lead to wholesale replacement of all the workers.” Still,
   Acemoglu acknowledged, Amazon Go is a signal of what’s to come. Retail
   stores employ 4.8 million people, according to the Bureau of Labor
   Statistics. They, and the millions of others who work in supporting
   roles behind the scenes of retail businesses, stand to be directly
   affected.

   For decades, the conventional belief among economists has been that
   technological advances have created more jobs than (or at least as many
   as) they eliminated, often moving workers into more sophisticated roles
   that couldn’t be automated; bank tellers were largely replaced by
   A.T.M.s, for example, but the number of people employed at banks
   increased nonetheless. In recent years, though, as the fields of
   robotics and A.I. have experienced vast technological leaps, the debate
   has shifted, with many economists acknowledging that the balance of
   jobs created versus jobs eliminated could start moving the other way,
   almost certainly leading to more income inequality.

   The ability to make purchases in a store using (often maddening)
   self-checkout kiosks has existed for some time; the small revolution
   that Amazon Go brings to the experience is the elimination of the
   checkout process altogether. Instead, computers scan shoppers’ phones
   as they enter, and they are then automatically charged for whatever
   items they put into their grocery bags and take home. (The Times said
   that the experience felt like “shoplifting.”) A few human workers still
   float around, to deal with glitches, answer questions, and check the
   I.D. of anyone trying to buy wine. From a consumer standpoint, there
   isn’t much to complain about: if it truly works, the technology could
   turn the chore of grocery shopping into a breezy afterthought, without
   the deadening wait in a long line to pay at the end.

   Acemoglu said that it’s far from preordained whether the technology
   that affords friction-free grocery shopping will put millions of people
   out of work, or simply create opportunities for them to move into other
   kinds of jobs. He said that the answer to that question will be decided
   by politicians and the public-policy choices they make on the tax code,
   education policy, and infrastructure spending, which have far greater
   effects than the actions of any one company—even one as large and
   powerful as Amazon. “These economic and technological conditions that
   are determining where automation is taking us, they are not set in
   stone,” Acemoglu said. “They are societal choices.”

   Acemoglu pointed out that although much is still unknown about the
   relationship between automation and employment, current tax law and
   other government policies have created incentives for employers to
   replace workers with machines, but not machines that could work
   collaboratively with human workers. In a new paper called “Artificial
   Intelligence, Automation and Work,” Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo, of
   Boston University, tried to develop a more precise way to look at the
   connection between automation and jobs. They concluded that automation
   had the potential to create greater wealth while also increasing
   economic inequality. The rise of increasingly powerful machines will
   inevitably reduce the demand for human labor, they say. But, they
   argue, with a commitment to sharing the wealth of the robot economy
   more broadly, and the appropriate investment in education that gives
   workers the skills they need to thrive, increased unemployment and
   inequality could be slowed. The survival of the machines themselves
   might even depend on it. “If we do not find a way of creating shared
   prosperity from the productivity gains generated by AI,” Acemoglu and
   Restrepo write, “there is a danger that the political reaction to these
   new technologies may slow down or even completely stop their adoption
   and development.”

Flick Chicks

A guide to women in the movies.


    Mindy Kaling

   September 26, 2011
   Illustration by Kirsten Ulve

   A few years ago, I sat down for a meeting with some executives at a
   movie studio that I will call Thinkscope Visioncloud. Thinkscope
   Visioncloud had put out several of my favorite movies, and they wanted
   to see if I had any feature ideas. I was very excited. I have a great
   job writing for “The Office,” but, really, all television writers do is
   dream of one day writing movies. I’ll put it this way: At the Oscars
   the most famous person in the room is, like, Angelina Jolie. At the
   Emmys the huge exciting celebrity is Bethenny Frankel. You get what I
   mean. It’s snobby and grossly aspirational, but it’s true.

   The junior executives’ office at Thinkscope Visioncloud was nicer than
   any room within a fifty-mile radius of the “Office” studio. After I
   finished pitching one of my ideas for a low-budget romantic comedy, I
   was met with silence. One of the execs sheepishly looked at the other
   execs. He finally said, “Yeah, but we’re really trying to focus on
   movies about board games. People really seem to respond to those.”

   For the rest of the meeting, we talked about whether there was any
   potential in a movie called “Yahtzee!” I made some polite suggestions
   and left.

   I am always surprised at what movie studios think people will want to
   see. I’m even more surprised at how often they are correct. Based on
   what I’ve learned from my time in Hollywood, the following titles are
   my best guess as to what may soon be coming to a theatre near you:

   “Bananagrams 3D”

   “Apples to Apples 4D” (The audience is pummelled with apples at the end
   of the movie.)

   “Crest Whitestrips”

   “Sharks vs. Volcanoes”

   “King Tut vs. King Kong”

   “Streptococcus vs. Candidiasis” (Strep Throat vs. Yeast Infection)

   “The Do-Over”

   “The Switcheroo”

   “Street Smart”

   “Street Stupid” (“Street Smart” sequel)

   “Fat Astronaut”

   “The Untitled Liam Neeson Vendetta Project”

   “Human Quilt” (horror movie)

   “The Cute Bear from Those Toilet-Paper Ads Movie”

   Those movies all sound great to me, and, incidentally, I am prepared to
   write any of them, if there is interest. But what I’d really like to
   write is a romantic comedy. This is my favorite kind of movie. I feel
   almost embarrassed revealing this, because the genre has been so
   degraded in the past twenty years that saying you like romantic
   comedies is essentially an admission of mild stupidity. But that has
   not stopped me from enjoying them.

   I like watching people fall in love onscreen so much that I can suspend
   my disbelief in the contrived situations that occur only in the
   heightened world of romantic comedies. I have come to enjoy the moment
   when the male lead, say, slips and falls right on top of the expensive
   wedding cake. I actually feel robbed when the female lead’s dress
   doesn’t get torn open at a baseball game while the JumboTron camera is
   on her. I regard romantic comedies as a subgenre of sci-fi, in which
   the world operates according to different rules than my regular human
   world. For me, there is no difference between Ripley from “Alien” and
   any Katherine Heigl character. They are equally implausible. They’re
   all participating in a similar level of fakey razzle-dazzle, and I
   enjoy every second of it.

   It makes sense, then, that in the romantic-comedy world there are many
   specimens of women who—like Vulcans or Mothra—do not exist in real
   life. Here are some examples:

   The Klutz

   When a beautiful actress is cast in a movie, executives rack their
   brains to find some kind of flaw in the character she plays that will
   still allow her to be palatable. She can’t be overweight or not
   perfect-looking, because who would pay to see that? A female who is not
   one hundred per cent perfect-looking in every way? You might as well
   film a dead squid decaying on a beach somewhere for two hours.

   So they make her a Klutz.

   The hundred-per-cent-perfect-looking female is perfect in every way
   except that she constantly bonks her head on things. She trips and
   falls and spills soup on her affable date (Josh Lucas. Is that his
   name? I know it’s two first names. Josh George? Brad Mike? Fred Tom?
   Yes, it’s Fred Tom). The Klutz clangs into stop signs while riding her
   bike and knocks over giant displays of fine china in department stores.
   Despite being five feet nine and weighing a hundred and ten pounds, she
   is basically like a drunk buffalo who has never been a part of human
   society. But Fred Tom loves her anyway.

   The Ethereal Weirdo

   The smart and funny writer Nathan Rabin coined the term Manic Pixie
   Dream Girl to describe this archetype after seeing Kirsten Dunst in the
   movie “Elizabethtown.” This girl can’t be pinned down and may or may
   not show up when you make concrete plans with her. She wears gauzy
   blouses and braids. She likes to dance in the rain and she weeps
   uncontrollably if she sees a sign for a missing dog or cat. She might
   spin a globe, place her finger on a random spot, and decide to move
   there. The Ethereal Weirdo appears a lot in movies, but nowhere else.
   If she were from real life, people would think she was a homeless woman
   and would cross the street to avoid her. But she is essential to the
   male fantasy that even if a guy is boring he deserves a woman who will
   find him fascinating and perk up his dreary life by forcing him to go
   skinny-dipping in a stranger’s pool.

   The Woman Who Is Obsessed with Her Career and Is No Fun at All

   I regularly work sixteen hours a day. Yet, like most people I know who
   are similarly busy, I’m a pleasant, pretty normal person. But that’s
   not how working women are depicted in movies. I’m not always barking
   orders into my hands-free phone device and yelling, “I have no time for
   this!” Often, a script calls for this uptight career woman to “relearn”
   how to seduce a man, and she has to do all sorts of crazy degrading
   crap, like eat a hot dog in a sexy way or something. And since when
   does holding a job necessitate that a woman pull her hair back in a
   severe, tight bun? Do screenwriters think that loose hair makes it hard
   to concentrate?

   The Forty-two-Year-Old Mother of the Thirty-Year-Old Male Lead

   If you think about the backstory of a typical mother character in a
   romantic comedy, you realize this: when “Mom” was an adolescent, the
   very week she started to menstruate she was impregnated with a baby who
   would grow up to be the movie’s likable brown-haired leading man. I am
   fascinated by Mom’s sordid early life. I would rather see this movie
   than the one I bought a ticket for.

   I am so brainwashed by the young-mom phenomenon that when I saw the
   poster for “The Proposal” I wondered for a second if the proposal in
   the movie was Ryan Reynolds’ suggesting that he send his mother, Sandra
   Bullock, to an old-age home.

   The Sassy Best Friend

   You know that really hilarious and horny best friend who is always
   asking about your relationship and has nothing really going on in her
   own life? She always wants to meet you in coffee shops or wants to go
   to Bloomingdale’s to sample perfumes? She runs a chic dildo store in
   the West Village? Nope? O.K., that’s this person.

   The Skinny Woman Who Is Beautiful and Toned but Also Gluttonous and
   Disgusting

   Again, I am more than willing to suspend my disbelief for good set
   decoration alone. One pristine kitchen from a Nancy Meyers movie like
   “It’s Complicated” compensates for five scenes of Diane Keaton being
   caught half naked in a topiary. But I can’t suspend disbelief enough,
   for instance, if the gorgeous and skinny heroine is also a ravenous pig
   when it comes to food. And everyone in the movie—her parents, her
   friends, her boss—are all complicit in this huge lie. They constantly
   tell her to stop eating. And this actress, this poor skinny actress who
   obviously lost weight to play the likable lead character, has to say
   things like “Shut up, you guys! I love cheesecake! If I want to eat an
   entire cheesecake, I will!” If you look closely, you can see this
   woman’s ribs through the dress she’s wearing—that’s how skinny she is,
   this cheesecake-loving cow.

   The Woman Who Works in an Art Gallery

   How many freakin’ art galleries are out there? Are people buying visual
   art on a daily basis? This posh/smart/classy profession is a favorite
   in movies. It’s in the same realm as kindergarten teacher or
   children’s-book illustrator in terms of accessibility: guys don’t
   really get it, but it is likable and nonthreatening.

   Art Gallery Woman: “Dust off the Warhol. You know, that Campbell’s Soup
   one in the crazy color! We have an important buyer coming into town,
   and this is a really big deal for my career. I have no time for this!”

   The Gallery Worker character is the rare female movie archetype that
   has a male counterpart. Whenever you meet a handsome, charming,
   successful man in a romantic comedy, the heroine’s friend always says
   the same thing: “He’s really successful. He’s”—say it with me—“an
   architect!”

   There are, like, nine people in the entire world who are architects,
   and one of them is my dad. None of them look like Patrick Dempsey. ♦

   A few years ago, I sat down for a meeting with some executives at a
   movie studio that I will call Thinkscope Visioncloud. Thinkscope
   Visioncloud had put out several of my favorite movies, and they wanted
   to see if I had any feature ideas. I was very excited. I have a great
   job writing for “The Office,” but, really, all television writers do is

What Amazon’s Purchase of Whole Foods Really Means


    Joshua Rothman

   June 24, 2017
   Behind the scenes, Amazon has been using technology to vertically
   integrate nearly the entire process of consumption.
   Courtesy Amazon / YouTube

   Last week, two days before announcing that it would be acquiring Whole
   Foods, Amazon released a short promotional video for a new product
   called the Dash Wand. The Wand is a candy-bar-size gizmo that costs
   twenty dollars. It sticks to your refrigerator with magnets and lets
   you order products by talking—it features Amazon’s voice assistant,
   Alexa—or by scanning barcodes. In the video, an affluent, middle-aged
   couple drift through their spotless kitchen, preparing for a dinner
   party. The woman peers into the fridge, where she discovers a bag of
   pre-peeled shrimp. She asks the Wand for a simple shrimp-pasta recipe,
   then orders ingredients for it, scanning the barcode of an empty jar of
   pasta sauce and proclaiming, “Mushrooms!” The next day, these items are
   delivered in a cooler bag. While cooking, she uses up the white wine,
   so the man, who’s milling around in the kitchen, tells the Wand, “Order
   white wine from Prime Now.” (Prime Now is Amazon’s same-day delivery
   service.) Shortly before the dinner guests arrive, he says, “Dim lights
   to seventy per cent.” When the other couples materialize, the
   thoroughly unstressed host proposes a toast: “To old friends!”

   There is something horrible about this little video. Why do the
   inhabitants of this suburban home require a recipe for pasta from a
   jar? Why can’t they turn the lights down using their hands? If the ad
   were an episode of “Black Mirror,” they would be clones living in a
   laboratory, attempting to follow the patterns of an outside world
   they’ve never seen. And yet the ad is not fantastical but descriptive.
   It’s unsettling because it’s an accurate portrayal of our new
   mail-order way of life, which Amazon has spent the past twenty-two
   years creating.

   It hasn’t always been obvious that Amazon would transform the feeling
   of everyday life. At first, the company looked like a bookstore; next,
   it became a mass retailer; later, for somewhat obscure reasons, it
   transformed into a television and movie studio. It seemed to be growing
   horizontally, by learning to sell new kinds of products. But Amazon
   wasn’t just getting wider; it was getting deeper, too. It wasn’t just
   selling products but inventing a new method of selling; behind the
   scenes, it was using technology to vertically integrate nearly the
   entire process of consumption. This integration is Amazon’s real
   product. It’s what you purchase when you become a member of Amazon
   Prime. (According to some estimates, eighty million American
   households—more than sixty per cent of the total—have Prime
   memberships.)

   Amazon has created the world’s most efficient order-fulfillment system,
   including a network of warehouses and a delivery arm, Amazon Logistics.
   It has started a shipping subsidiary, Amazon Maritime, to transport
   goods on cargo ships from China to the United States. Netflix, NASA,
   and the C.I.A. are among the million customers who run their systems
   using Amazon’s cloud-computing platform, Amazon Web Services; this
   year, A.W.S. is expected to earn thirteen billion dollars in
   revenue—about as much as the N.F.L. In addition to its own
   point-of-sale devices—the Dash Button, Dash Wand, and Amazon Echo—it
   has created its own in-house advertising ecosystem: television shows
   like “Transparent” may win Emmys, but they also encourage customers to
   sign up for Amazon Prime, and pull them away from traditional
   television, where they might see ads for competing companies, such as
   Walmart. Amazon, in short, is far more than a retailer. It’s like
   Diebold, U.P.S., Target, the CW, I.B.M., and S.A.P. combined.

   Ben Thompson, a technology analyst who writes the blog Stratechery, has
   proposed an extraordinarily useful model for understanding Amazon’s
   reach. He argues that Amazon works by dividing the world of commerce up
   into building blocks, which he calls “primitives.” Some “primitives”
   are business-facing: servers, databases, warehouses, delivery trucks.
   Others are consumer-facing: books, music, clothing, television shows.
   Amazon makes money by allowing its customers to combine these
   primitives in unusually convenient and efficient ways. Using them, it’s
   possible to run a whole company from within the Amazon ecosystem, with
   servers running in Amazon’s cloud and products stored in and shipped
   from its warehouses. Amazon itself launches new businesses using the
   primitives it has mastered. Many people have seen the Whole Foods
   acquisition as a way for Amazon to sell fancier groceries online, while
   using its larger scale and greater efficiency to lower prices. But, in
   Thompson’s view, the acquisition is best understood as giving Amazon
   access to new, grocery-based primitives, such as fruit, vegetables,
   meats, and food-ready warehouses. He suggests that the company will
   launch “Amazon Grocery Services,” a subsidiary that farmers or small
   manufacturers might use to sell, warehouse, and ship their products.
   Restaurants could stock their kitchens with it, too.

   Where will it end? At first, as Amazon added more building blocks to
   its toolkit, the world changed in intangible ways. Ordering got easier;
   packages arrived faster. Lately, though, the physical changes have
   grown more apparent. Already, we spend less time shopping in the
   physical world. Now the disappearance of bookstores seems to be
   extending to retail stores more generally. Grocery stores, too, will
   soon be thinner on the ground. Along with the leaf blower and the
   ice-cream truck, the delivery van, nosing into one driveway after
   another, is now a staple of suburban life.

   It’s increasingly easy to imagine that a few decades from now, we’ll
   tell our kids about how we used to “go to the store”; they’ll look at
   us and say, “What?” Earlier this month, Amazon filed a patent
   application describing large, multi-story drone towers in urban
   centers. Probably, in the future, such buildings will seem
   unremarkable. The hive-like towers will have loading docks and
   warehouses on the lower floors and bays for drones higher up; the
   drones may be repaired and supplied by robots. “There is a growing need
   and desire to locate fulfillment centers within cities, such as in
   downtown districts,” the patent application says. How else would your
   wine beat your guests to the door?

   Last week, two days before announcing that it would be acquiring Whole
   Foods, Amazon released a short promotional video for a new product
   called the Dash Wand. The Wand is a candy-bar-size gizmo that costs
   twenty dollars. It sticks to your refrigerator with magnets and lets

Welcoming Our New Robot Overlords

Once, robots assisted human workers. Now it’s the other way around.


    Sheelah Kolhatkar

   October 16, 2017
   At Brown University’s Humans to Robots lab, a machine learns how to
   manipulate delicate and irregular objects.
   Photograph by Grant Cornett for The New Yorker

   When David Stinson finished high school, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in
   1977, the first thing he did was get a job building houses. After a few
   years, though, the business slowed. Stinson was then twenty-four, with
   two children to support. He needed something stable. As he explained
   over lunch recently, that meant finding a job at one of the two
   companies in the area that offered secure, blue-collar work. “Either
   I’ll be working at General Motors or I’ll be working at Steelcase by
   the end of the year,” he vowed in 1984. A few months later, he got a
   job at Steelcase, the world’s largest manufacturer of office furniture,
   and he’s been working at its Grand Rapids metal plant ever since.

   Stinson is now fifty-eight. He has a full, reddish face, a thick head
   of silver hair, and a majestic midsection. His navy polo shirt displays
   his job title—“Zone Leader”—and, like everyone else in the plant, he
   always has a pair of protective earplugs on a neon string draped around
   his neck. His glasses have plastic shields on the sides that give him
   the air of a cranky scientist.

   “I don’t regret coming here,” Stinson said. We were sitting in the
   plant’s cafeteria, and Stinson was unwrapping an Italian sub, supplied
   by a deli that every Thursday offers plant workers sandwiches for four
   dollars instead of eight. “There’s been times I’ve thought about
   leaving, but it’s just getting to be a much more comfortable atmosphere
   around here. The technology is really helping that kind of thing, too.
   Instead of taking responsibility away from you, it’s a big aid. It’s
   definitely the wave of the future here.”

   William Sandee, Jr., a sixty-four-year-old worker on the paint line,
   sat down next to Stinson with a carton of fries and a cup of ketchup,
   and tossed his safety goggles on the table. “We try to have some fun
   with it,” he said in a low near-growl. “It can get intense.”

   Sandee, who has neatly combed gray hair and an alert, owlish face,
   began working at Steelcase in 1972, after waiting in line with six
   hundred people just to put in an application. “They made it very
   lucrative to be a Steelcase employee, back in the day,” Sandee said.
   Plant managers were known to drive fancy cars and have second homes on
   the lake; the company paid the college tuition for employees’ children,
   who often spent summers working at the local plants; and there were
   company picnics and a bowling tournament, which once had fifteen
   hundred players. (The tournament is still held, now with around three
   hundred participants.)

   In the nineties, Steelcase employed more than ten thousand workers in
   the United States and operated seven factories around Grand Rapids,
   making chairs, filing cabinets, desks, and tables, and the screws,
   bolts, and casters that went into them. Packed shoulder to shoulder,
   workers polished and painted wood and assembled steel parts by hand.
   Today, there are only two Steelcase plants in Michigan—the metal
   factory, which makes desks and filing cabinets, and a nearby “wood
   plant,” which produces wood furniture. In total, they employ fewer than
   two thousand workers. The company’s only other U.S. plant, in Athens,
   Alabama, employs a thousand full-time workers.

   The history of Steelcase, in many ways, is the history of manufacturing
   in America. The company was founded in 1912 with one product, a
   fireproof metal wastebasket. As the economy boomed in the following
   decades, America’s burgeoning corporations needed to furnish their
   offices with desks and shelving and cubicle walls. “If you were a
   high-school kid growing up in Grand Rapids in the eighties and you
   didn’t want to go to college, and you got a job at a Steelcase factory,
   you were set,” Rob Kirkbride, who covered Steelcase for almost two
   decades at the Grand Rapids Press and industry publications, told me.
   “It was like winning the lottery.”

   Then the dot-com bubble burst and countless startups found themselves
   auctioning off their office furniture. By 2001, Steelcase had lost a
   third of its sales and started closing plants throughout western
   Michigan. Its manufacturing was moved to Mexico, China, and eventually
   India. In 2011, the company announced a new series of closings and
   layoffs, shutting another plant near Grand Rapids, one in Texas, and
   one in Ontario, Canada. Almost all the company’s chair manufacturing
   was relocated to Mexico.

   These days, as U.S. companies report record profits and demand millions
   of sleek new workspaces, Steelcase is again on the upswing. Its
   corporate headquarters, housed in a refurbished factory, is a
   laboratory of workplace trends, with open floor plans and
   glass-sheathed work pods where people recline with their laptops or
   hover at standing desks. In the two Michigan plants that remain open,
   employees create metal components for furniture sets and conference
   tables in dozens of shades of wood veneer.

   As technology is making the work faster, more efficient, and more
   environmentally sound, the products are being created with far fewer
   workers. “Companies are obviously not sending out press releases
   saying, ‘We’re not hiring more people,’ but that’s what I hear on the
   street,” Kirkbride said. There are automated assembly lines, and
   robotic arms lifting tabletops that were once hauled by men. Stinson
   took me across a dense wall of machinery and past a giant contraption
   that makes cardboard boxes so that the plant doesn’t have to order
   them. “You can just punch it into the touch screen there and go, I need
   86-17, boom-boom-boom, I need fourteen of ’em. Hit the button, and it
   cuts it for you,” he said. “That kind of stuff is really cool. So it
   isn’t so much that we’re eliminating jobs, we’re eliminating the
   waste.”

   As a zone leader, Stinson is responsible for about fifteen employees on
   a section of the production line that makes parts for Steelcase’s Ology
   series—height-adjustable tables built for the standing-desk craze.
   Until last year, the plant workers had to consult a long list of steps,
   taking pains to remove the correct parts out of a cart filled with
   variously sized bolts and screws and pins and to insert each one in the
   correct hole and in the correct order. Now computerized workstations,
   called “vision tables,” dictate, step by step, how workers are to
   assemble a piece of furniture. The process is virtually mistake-proof:
   the system won’t let the workers proceed if a step isn’t completed
   correctly. We stood behind a young woman wearing a polo shirt and Lycra
   shorts, with a long blond ponytail. When a step was completed, a light
   turned on above the next required part, accompanied by a
   beep-beep-whoosh sound. A scanner overhead tracked everything as it was
   happening, beaming the data it collected to unseen engineers with
   iPads. Employees who follow a strict automated protocol—some call them
   “meat robots”—need little training. Even the drill was attached to a
   computer-assisted arm; the worker just had to move it to the right
   position and let the machine do its magic. A decade ago, industrial
   robots assisted workers in their tasks. Now workers—those who
   remain—assist the robots in theirs.

   For decades, the conventional view among economists was that
   technological advances create as many opportunities for workers as they
   take away. In the past several years, however, research has begun to
   suggest otherwise. “It’s not that we’re running out of work or jobs per
   se,” David Autor, an M.I.T. economist who studies the impact of
   automation on employment, said. “But a subset of people with low skill
   levels may not be able to earn a reasonable standard of living based on
   their labor. We see that already.” As automation depresses wages, jobs
   in factories become both less abundant and less appealing.

   This process, Autor and other economists argue, can also exacerbate
   inequality. The labor market is built around the idea of labor
   scarcity: each person has a bundle of labor—his or her own capacity to
   work—that employers need and that she can sell in the job market
   through employment during the course of a career of thirty years or so.
   That model is eroding. “It doesn’t mean there’s no money around, but
   it’s just accruing to the owners of capital, to the owners of ideas,”
   Autor says. “And capital is less equitably distributed than labor.
   Everyone is born with some labor, but not everyone is born with
   capital.”

   In the Steelcase metal factory, automation has led the company to seek
   out more highly educated managers, who are now expected to have a
   college degree, not just a high-school diploma. The company, following
   the “lean manufacturing” model pioneered by Toyota, hires young
   engineers to scan factory data for additional “efficiencies,” which can
   translate into further automation. For people who have technical
   degrees and can manage automated systems, and for owners of companies
   that are in the process of automating, the potential for increased
   wealth is significant. But for less skilled workers it’s a different
   story. In a paper from earlier this year, the economists Daron
   Acemoglu, of M.I.T., and Pascual Restrepo, of Boston University,
   studied local job markets in the United States between 1990 and 2007,
   and they found that the concentration of industrial robots in an area
   was directly related to a decline in jobs and in pay. Technology can
   compound the effects of globalization. By one measure, the average
   manufacturing worker in the United States earned nine per cent less in
   2015 than the average worker in 1973, while the economy over all grew
   by two hundred per cent. At Steelcase, Stinson acknowledged, workers
   were earning around the same dollar salary that they had in 1987.

   Neither Stinson nor Sandee thought that automation posed a threat to
   their jobs, though. Sandee remembers when Frank Merlotti, a legendary
   figure at Steelcase who retired as president and C.E.O. in 1990, used
   to visit the plant and deliver rousing speeches to the workers. “Frank
   would look at you, and he would say this before he would even say much
   of anything,” Sandee recalled. “ ‘Listen,’ he says, ‘it’s you people,
   you people, all you people out here who make this thing work, who make
   it happen.’ ”

   Sandee speaks fervently about the dignity of manual labor. He told me
   about a trip he had taken with his grandkids to New York City, where
   they had visited the Empire State Building. “You’ve probably seen that
   picture of those guys, where they’re sitting way up there on all that
   steel, up there, they’re eating their lunch together,” Sandee said.
   “And they got some rivets and stuff there. But the rivets, in my
   opinion, are the people.” He seemed to be describing a famous
   black-and-white photograph titled “Lunch Atop a Skyscraper.” “That was
   one of the nicest things I saw there, of all of New York City, it was
   those old-timers. Building that building. How did they do it, you know?
   It’s amazing.”

   In Sandee’s opinion, there was something irreplaceable about the
   combination of sentient judgment and human hands. Think of all the
   things that robots couldn’t do: get their hands into things; unpack a
   box; close a twist-tie. Even in an automated future, he thought, you’d
   need people to apply the wisdom gained through age and experience.
   “You’re still gonna have to have the people here,” he said. “Somebody’s
   still gotta man that machine that’s supposed to be able to do
   everything. And tell us when that machine doesn’t want to work the way
   it’s supposed to.”

   The Humans to Robots Laboratory, at Brown University, is on the ground
   floor of a red brick building in the center of Providence, Rhode
   Island. It has the feel of an oversized garage, filled with stained,
   lumpy sofas and scattered gadgets and toys, along with the odd takeout
   food carton. There, on a recent afternoon, a robot with bulky red arms
   set about pulling the petals from an artificial daisy. The robot, known
   around the lab as Winnie, held the flower in a pair of rubber-tipped
   pincers, then retracted its other arm, rotated it slightly, and pointed
   it down toward the daisy. It emitted an idling-motor sound, as though
   contemplating what to do next. Then the hand jerked down toward the
   flower, grabbed a petal, and flung it on the table. It retracted again,
   with a mechanical reeeh-raaah! noise. The movements evoked a
   prehistoric bird.

   The lab was created by Stefanie Tellex, a computer-science professor
   who studies ways to create robots that can work coöperatively with
   humans. “Broadly, my research program is about making robots that can
   work with people on complex tasks,” Tellex told me. “We’re trying to
   make robots that can robustly perceive and manipulate the objects in
   their environment.”

   The word “manipulate” comes up often among roboticists. Even in highly
   automated factories, jobs that involve packing boxes or putting tiny
   parts together are done by people. The most agile robot, confronted
   with an object that it’s never seen before, can pick it up only ninety
   per cent of the time, which isn’t good enough for industrial purposes.

   Solving this problem—teaching a machine to handle a random assortment
   of irregularly shaped objects—would have an immense impact; Tellex
   envisages machines that change diapers and prepare dinner. In her class
   Topics in Collaborative Robotics, one student proposed to teach a robot
   to make a salad. “It’s very difficult, and probably not very cost
   efficient, for a robot to make a salad,” Tellex’s teaching assistant,
   Josh Roy, said. “We joked that we could make a thirty-thousand-dollar
   salad with a robot.” Part of the challenge, whatever the task, is
   devising an “end effector”—the handlike tool at the end of the robot’s
   arm—that can grip a variety of shapes and sizes and textures with
   different levels of pressure. The more complex part, and the part that
   preoccupies Tellex, involves teaching the robot to perceive the
   different objects so that it understands what it’s supposed to do.

   Winnie was programmed by one of Tellex’s students, Rebecca Pankow, a
   first-year Ph.D. candidate with bright brown eyes and dimples. “It’s
   not very refined,” Pankow said, as Winnie continued pulling petals.
   “This is more of a proof of concept.” She went on, “I chose this
   project because I thought it was an interesting computer-vision
   problem. It’s applicable to other things that I work on outside this
   class. And I just thought it was very cute.”

   An industrial robot will pick up the same object, in the same location,
   over and over. The challenge, and the multibillion-dollar business
   opportunity, was to teach a robot to function in an environment that
   was constantly changing. This was Winnie’s assignment. “There’s a
   saying in robotics: Anything a human being can do after age five is
   very easy for a robot,” one of Tellex’s students had said to me
   earlier. “Learn to play chess, no problem. Learn to walk, no way.”

   John Oberlin, another Ph.D. student, who wore a long brown ponytail,
   safety goggles, and sandals with wool socks, bent his tall frame over a
   computer on a side table. The screen showed what Winnie was “seeing”
   through its hand-camera. “If I were going to try and pick up this tape
   over and over”—Oberlin picked up and dropped a roll of masking tape—“it
   only exists in one way, on the table,” he told me. “So I can just
   memorize what it looks like in one way, and then all I have to do is
   search this space, basically. But these petals on this flower have more
   than one way to fall. Sometimes they can be rotated a little bit,
   sometimes they can droop, sometimes they can curve, so these petals are
   deformable. And that makes them inherently harder to localize.”

   Pankow had retrofitted an artificial flower with little magnets on its
   petals, so that they could be reattached and reused. “The camera is
   currently taking a picture of the table,” she said. “And then you put
   the flower there, and it will take the picture again. And it will say,
   ‘Oh, look at the difference between the two—a flower has appeared.’ ”

   Winnie’s arm moved in, clamped its pincers around a petal, plucked it
   off, and then threw it onto the table. It made the reeeh-raaah! noise
   and then went back to idling. The cycle continued until there was only
   one petal left. It was sticking out at an awkward angle, and Winnie’s
   arm hovered for a long time above it. Pankow and Oberlin watched
   nervously.

   Winnie moved in, its arm quivering slightly, and positioned its arm to
   the outside of the flower in a way that looked unlikely to succeed. The
   grippers opened, trying but failing to close around the petal. Then the
   arm pulled up again. Reeeh-raaah!

   Oberlin adjusted the flower. “I bet it comes down a little bit . . .”
   he said. This time, Winnie managed to peel off the final petal.

   Pankow and Oberlin spoke about the adjustments that would have to be
   made for the technology to be usable in the real world. “You can
   imagine this ability to classify or examine plants or other structures
   in terms of their parts, in order to compose or localize each one of
   those petals—that has applications in actual industry,” Oberlin said.
   “You can imagine applying that modelling technique to real plants.”

   “Blueberries,” Tellex said quietly, leaning against the window. “That’s
   my goal. People aren’t going to pay us to take petals off of daisies.
   But they will pay us to pick blueberries.” She looked down at the table
   and the bare daisy stem. “Did it just pick all of these? In order? This
   is awesome. This is not something I’ve ever seen a robot do. And that’s
   cool. And now we’ve figured some things out, as a result of doing
   this.”

   Harvesting fruit and other produce, which involves hours under the hot
   sun, is the kind of job that Americans are increasingly reluctant to do
   and that often goes to low-paid immigrant labor. Yet the implications
   extend beyond agriculture. A robot that could efficiently pick
   blueberries could probably do a lot of things that are currently the
   exclusive province of human beings. Potentially, it could advance on a
   frontier challenge of industrial robotics—not only picking a wallet out
   of a bin but riffling through it and pulling out a credit card.

   “I usually like to ask the question: How can this help make society
   better?” Tellex said. “What is something that people do now that robots
   might do?”

   Corporate executives want to know the answer to that question, but they
   seldom ask it publicly. Automation is a topic that gets treated with
   enormous diplomacy, both in Europe and in the United States. The Dutch
   supermarket chain Ahold Delhaize, which owns the Stop & Shop and Peapod
   grocery-store brands in the U.S., hopes to have all its retail outlets
   cleaned by robots within five years. Although the company was not eager
   to publicize the details of the venture, the images that spring to mind
   are part Isaac Asimov and part Dr. Seuss—doors closing with a thud and
   the aisles bursting to life, with metallic objects scampering across
   the floor, brightly colored squeegees and sponges dropping from the
   ceiling, followed by an explosion of soapsuds and baby carrots. But the
   goal wasn’t to replace human workers, a company spokesperson insisted.
   With store-cleaning robots, “our associates in our stores will have
   more time for customers.”

   Such initiatives aren’t limited to private businesses; neither are the
   sensitivities. In southern Denmark, the regional government hired a
   chief robotics officer, Poul Martin Møller, to help integrate more
   robots into the public sector, largely as a money-saving measure. He
   decided that the Danish hospital system, which was under pressure to
   reduce costs, could benefit from robotic orderlies. There were few
   medical-oriented robots on the market, though, so Møller and his team
   took small, mobile robots with movable arms, designed for use in
   warehouses, and refashioned them, so that they could carry supplies to
   doctors and nurses. The machines worked well, scuttling through surgery
   wings and psych wards like helpful crabs, never complaining or taking
   cigarette breaks. But Møller wasn’t prepared for the reaction of the
   hospital staff, who recognized their mechanical colleagues as potential
   replacements, and tried to sabotage them. Fecal matter and urine were
   left in charging stations.

   Since then, Møller has evangelized about “change management,” and the
   need to handle people carefully as new technology is introduced. “As a
   taxpayer, here we pay thirty-three, thirty-four dollars an hour for
   unskilled work, like orderlies,” he told me. “Robots cost, at most,
   around ninety-five cents an hour. If you do the math, you can have
   thirty-five robots for one human. So you might as well face reality and
   face facts. That means you have a bunch of orderlies who need jobs.” By
   way of redress, he proposes using the robot-derived savings, at least
   initially, to retrain the displaced humans for more sophisticated jobs
   that the robots can’t (yet) do.

   In the United States, where automation in the workplace is no less
   politically fraught, corporate executives are reluctant to be quoted on
   the subject; when they are, their usual line is that robots aren’t
   replacing humans but simply helping to make their jobs less taxing.
   This is not entirely a misrepresentation. When I asked Dave Stinson and
   his colleagues at Steelcase about how automation had affected the
   assembly line, they said, for the most part, that it had made things
   easier. The factory was cleaner, less noisy, more productive. When
   something went wrong with the assembly, they could diagnose the problem
   swiftly, by consulting the data. Most workers welcomed being rotated
   through different positions, rather than doing the same thing for years
   at a time.

   The work placed less stress on their bodies, too. At one time,
   twenty-five hundred steel tabletops came off the assembly line each
   day, requiring two men to sweat and strain to get each one into the
   right place; now a robotic arm with grippers moved the tops.
   Workers—the ones who had survived the economic downturns, offshoring,
   and technological changes—had an easier time than ever before. In the
   old days, Stinson said, “It was, How much longer am I going to be able
   to do this? That’s kind of a question that you would always ask—how
   much longer can I hold up doing this, physically just holding up?
   Ergonomically, the difference today is huge. Huge.” Now he could work
   longer without burning out, and the work was easier. Who could complain
   about that?

   Automation has also increased the amount of manufacturing in the United
   States, by making it more efficient. The most immediate way that it
   makes manufacturing more efficient, of course, is by requiring fewer
   workers. Still, when manufacturing that has been sent overseas comes
   back, it brings some jobs back, too, even if they are not the same
   complement of jobs, and not in their old numbers. Last year, for the
   first time in decades, the number of Americans employed in
   manufacturing increased—more jobs returned or were created than
   left—and automation-enabled “reshoring” is a big reason for that.

   In a hundred-and-twenty-five-thousand-square-foot factory in the town
   of Hatfield, Pennsylvania, forty-five minutes north of Philadelphia,
   dozens of giant, automated industrial presses loom over a cement
   landscape. They belong to the Rodon Group, one of the largest
   family-owned injection-molding companies in the country. Founded in
   1956, the company makes millions of high-end plastic parts each year:
   containers for cosmetics, caps, pushpin heads, bottle tops.

   One of Rodon’s subsidiaries was a “construction toy” company—comparable
   to Lego and Fischertechnik—called K’Nex. The K’Nex line had been
   invented by the son of the Rodon Group’s founder, and, in the late
   nineteen-nineties and early two-thousands, it was run by a former
   Hasbro executive. Hasbro, like most of the American toy industry, had
   moved its production to China, and the executive decided to do the same
   thing with K’Nex. There were trade-offs with outsourcing: quality
   control was less reliable, and it was harder to respond nimbly to
   changing customer demands in the trend-driven toy business. But the
   savings were dramatic; on average, it cost less than half as much to
   make a product in China as it did in the United States.

   Michael Araten, the current C.E.O. of K’Nex Brands and the
   grandson-in-law of Rodon’s founder, told me that business had been
   relatively stable until the financial crisis arrived, and sales
   plunged. Rodon laid off around forty people, about a third of its
   workforce. Araten said that when business picked up the discussion
   quickly turned to how the company could rehire those people. One
   obvious solution presented itself: K’Nex could bring its manufacturing
   back to the United States so long as it could remain price-competitive
   with the China-sourced toy companies. K’Nex managers concluded that
   reshoring was feasible, but they would have to automate as much of the
   process as possible.

   On a recent visit, the plant’s manufacturing floor was filled with the
   sound of molding presses clamping down with as much as four hundred
   tons of pressure. No people were visible. Most of the presses work
   twenty-four hours a day, drawing plastic resin into a hopper, heating
   it to six hundred degrees Fahrenheit, and then blasting the liquid into
   molds, which are enormous blocks of stainless steel,
   precision-fabricated in an adjacent tool shop to create the shape of
   the desired part. (The molds used to be hand-fashioned by
   tool-and-die-makers, who were considered artisans; now a series of
   programmable robots do most of the job.) Automated arms lift the parts
   up to cool, before depositing them in boxes. The completed parts are
   bright orange, purple, and red, and resemble dime-store candies. Once
   the boxes are full, human workers replace them, and wheel the full ones
   away to be shipped out to their customers.

   A twenty-five-year-old “automation tech” named John Wilson had been
   hired to help integrate robotics into the plant as it moved toward
   increasing automation. Wilson is pale and thin, with glasses and a dark
   beard; he speaks in a low monotone, and gives the sense of someone who
   is more comfortable interacting with screens than with people. The
   child of two accountants, Wilson completed a mechanical-engineering
   degree at Philadelphia University in 2014, and said that he had sought
   out a manufacturing job where he could work directly with different
   types of automated machines. The Rodon Group had obliged. During
   Wilson’s three years at the company, twenty-four new automated presses
   have been introduced. There was a time when a plant worker was
   dedicated to each press, shovelling in plastic polymers, pulling the
   cranks and pushing the buttons, and scooping out the finished products
   and loading them onto trucks. Now, Wilson explained, one operator
   manages between eight and ten presses, which are overseen by digital
   systems. As at Steelcase, the robots have reduced accidents. When I
   asked if there were any jobs in the plant that automated machines
   couldn’t do, Wilson thought for a moment and said, “Cleaning up the
   floor after these machines, and machine-tending.”

   By installing robots and controlling its payroll and other costs, the
   company has been able to make ninety per cent of its parts and products
   in the United States—a move that Araten likes to describe as “patriotic
   capitalism.” Rodon and K’Nex use their made-in-the-U.S.A. credentials
   in their marketing. President Obama visited the Hatfield plant in 2012;
   Hillary Clinton stopped by in 2016. “The choice of how you spend your
   money really matters,” Araten said. “If you buy stuff from an American
   farmer or manufacturer, you’re helping an American family.”

   Sitting in a company conference room that was lined with shelves
   displaying plastic toys and framed vintage production orders from the
   nineteen-fifties, Araten said, “I talk to C.E.O.s all the time who say,
   ‘It’s not my job to worry about the rest of the country.’ And I say,
   ‘Well, whose job is it? You’ve got to do what you can in the United
   States to keep the United States strong.’ ” He went on, “If you think
   there is a benefit to having a stable citizenry that has good-paying
   jobs, that can support a family, you need to be willing to make some
   trade-offs there. Our responsibility is, yes, to our shareholders but
   also to our employees, and to our community. We made a decision—we are
   willing to make less of a profit in order to keep jobs here.”

   Araten acknowledged that, relative to sales, the Hatfield factory
   employed fewer people than it had done in the past. (Rodon’s revenue
   has grown by an average of fifteen per cent over each of the past five
   years, while its staffing has increased much more modestly.) But the
   jobs that they do have and will have, he said, will be higher skilled
   and better paying. He argued that the government could encourage
   similar moves by other companies, through tax policy and major
   investments in education, while also preparing for the coming
   technological changes. Still, even Araten isn’t immune from the call of
   high finance: last year, he and the rest of the family decided to sell
   K’Nex to a Chinese-French private-equity firm, Cathay Capital. It is
   unclear whether his new partners will be aligned, over the long term,
   with his people-before-profit philosophy.

   “The winds are changing,” Araten said. “I think part of the reason
   populism is rising around the world is that the gap is getting too big.
   Having so much inequality creates instability in a country. Maybe
   twenty years ago, we still had too many poor people, but they believed
   that they had a shot. I believe some of that is being sucked away.”

   Manufacturing jobs now account for less than ten per cent of the
   American workforce. As plants have closed, displaced employees have
   sought work in fast-food restaurants or in big-box retail stores, where
   the pay and the benefits are substantially less attractive. And,
   increasingly, even those jobs are fading away. Storefront retail is
   fast losing ground to the online marketplace. McDonald’s is introducing
   “digital ordering kiosks” that are expected to replace human cashiers
   at fifty-five hundred restaurants by the end of 2018. Meanwhile,
   companies like Uber and Google are investing heavily in
   autonomous-driving technology, betting that such vehicles will reshape
   transportation. In August, 2016, Uber purchased Otto, a startup based
   in San Francisco that sells technology designed to automate long-haul
   trucking. There are nearly two million long-distance truck drivers in
   the United States, most of whom are male and lack a college degree;
   paying for them accounts for a third of the costs in the
   seven-hundred-billion-dollar trucking industry. Construction jobs, too,
   are threatened by automation; a New York-based firm has introduced a
   laser-guided system that can lay eight hundred to twelve hundred bricks
   a day, more than twice as many as an average mason.

   For low-skilled workers, warehouse jobs have seemed to be something of
   a bright spot. Even if fewer people are required to staff a Target or a
   Sam’s Club outlet, the movement of products requires a network of
   warehouses to store and ship goods. Amazon—the world’s largest online
   retailer—currently has more than ninety thousand employees at its U.S.
   distribution centers, and plans to hire tens of thousands more. Workers
   still do the “picking” in a warehouse, using their dexterous fingers
   and discerning brains to take soap and coffee and tubes of toothpaste
   and millions of other products off the shelves and put them into boxes
   to fulfill the online shopping orders that make up an increasing
   portion of consumers’ buying patterns.

   But the same factors that make warehouses a draw for labor have made
   them a tempting target for automation. In 2012, Amazon spent almost
   eight hundred million dollars to buy a robotics company called Kiva,
   which makes robots that can zoom around a factory floor and move tall
   stacks of shelves of up to seven hundred and fifty pounds in weight. A
   Deutsche Bank research report estimated that Amazon could save
   twenty-two million dollars a year by introducing the Kiva machines in a
   single warehouse; the savings company-wide could reach into the
   billions. With such a powerful incentive, Amazon is on a quest to
   acquire or develop systems that can replace human pickers. When, in
   June, it announced plans to buy the Whole Foods supermarket chain,
   speculation quickly spread that the company intended to automate the
   grocer’s food-distribution centers as well as its stores.

   Simply automating a legacy warehouse, however, is a halfway measure, as
   a visit to Symbotic makes clear. A privately held company based in an
   industrial park outside Boston, it sells fully automated warehouse
   systems to large retail chains, and the new warehouses resemble the old
   ones about as much as a Tesla resembles a Model T. The company’s
   twenty-thousand-square-foot test center is a giant cube of interlocking
   green, yellow, and white steel shelving, tracks, and cages that extend
   from the floor almost to the ceiling. There are no aisles for lifts to
   pass through, and no stations for human product pickers. There is no
   space inside the matrix for people at all.

   Robotic arms unpack pallets of tomato sauce, salsa, toilet paper, and
   soda, and place them on a blue conveyor belt, where they are carried
   deep into the storage cage. A fleet of little green robots that look
   like race cars in a Pixar film come to life and zoom inside the cage on
   dedicated tracks, emitting high-pitched whirring sounds. They collect
   the cases of products and stash them on shelves until they are needed.
   Then an algorithm directs the little car-bots to go back in and bring
   the desired products out.

   “This absolutely reinvents the warehouse,” Chris Gahagan, Symbotic’s
   C.E.O., said as he showed me around. He is a muscular fellow with
   dirty-blond hair pulled back in a ponytail, and looks as if he could
   have had an alternate career leading tourists on spelunking trips
   through Belize. “Now you can build an even smaller warehouse, or carry
   more skus, or serve more stores out of the same warehouse. It gives you
   huge flexibility.”

   Gahagan was recruited in 2015 by Symbotic’s owner, Richard B. Cohen,
   the press-shy billionaire owner of the C&S grocery wholesaler. Cohen
   had wanted a system that would make his grocery warehouses more
   efficient; then he realized that he could make a business of selling it
   to other retailers. Symbotic says it now has more orders than it can
   swiftly fulfill. The automated system, Gahagan notes, produces more
   efficiencies than are obvious at first glance. Because it can store
   more products in a smaller space, companies could have more compact
   warehouses closer to their retail outlets, requiring less trucking. The
   robots don’t need light to operate, so the warehouse could use, Gahagan
   estimated, thirty-five per cent less energy than a conventional one,
   while reducing labor costs by eighty per cent. Many warehouse operators
   run their businesses based on labor hours, in order to minimize
   overtime pay, among other things. But an automated system could run
   twenty-four hours a day. A typical system costs around fifty million
   dollars to install, Gahagan said—not an insignificant investment. But,
   he maintained, it would pay for itself, on average, in four and a half
   years.

   We walked past a “Safety Is Our First Priority” sign on the wall, an
   artifact from a time when there might have been frequent worker
   injuries in such a place, and clambered up a set of steel stairs. All
   around us, machines were moving, gracefully and tirelessly executing
   their tasks.

   “You start to look at all the costs that you can avoid,” he told me.
   “It’s phenomenal. So, as soon as one company does this, it makes it
   more competitive.” That instantly puts pressure on competitors to
   follow suit. “You can’t just sit there being that inefficient,” Gahagan
   went on. “Your assortment in your store is not as good, you’re paying
   more for labor, more for trucking. If a new startup came along in
   retail, it would start with this.” He gestured around at the cavernous,
   chilly space.

   The most important human job at a Symbotic warehouse is that of the
   “system operator,” which is akin to a job in flight operations, where
   you sit all day behind a bank of screens and make sure that
   everything’s working right. A couple of human workers were needed—for
   now—to help unload and load the trucks as they came and went with the
   inventory, and four or so mechanics were kept on staff to service the
   bots when they needed it (because “shit happens”). In all, the average
   system requires eight or nine people per shift, a fraction of what a
   traditional warehouse requires.

   Most jobs in warehouses are undesirable and hard to fill, Gahagan
   assured me. A typical worker might lift thousands of pounds of goods
   each day and walk the equivalent of a marathon, five or six days a
   week. It could be freezing in the winter, and sweltering during the
   summer months. “Their turnover is huge,” he said. With the robotic
   version, one higher-skilled person sits behind a console and types in
   commands, and is paid almost twice as much per hour as a manual laborer
   would be.

   Gahagan was reluctant to talk about Symbotic’s customers, who aren’t
   keen to draw attention to their interest in nearly human-free warehouse
   systems. “There is some sensitivity, given our . . . political
   situation,” he said. “It’s just a reality of the times that we live
   in.” But the Wall Street Journal has reported that Target is trying a
   Symbotic warehouse and that Walmart has installed several. Gahagan
   allowed that what he called the “red” cola giant—Coca-Cola—is using two
   Symbotic distribution centers. (“It was tricky with the unions, but
   they’ve made it work.”) Now, he said, Coke’s main competitor, the “blue
   one”—Pepsi—wanted to try the system.

   “If someone can start a warehouse with automation and sell for less,
   everyone else has to follow,” Gahagan said. “Consumers buy on price, so
   the cost on the supply chain matters. Walmart, it made a very efficient
   supply chain and that’s why it was able to offer the lowest prices in
   its stores, so everyone else had to compete. And now you’re seeing that
   happen with automation.”

   He observed that technological innovation has been happening in one way
   or another for a hundred years. Tractors replaced manual plows, but we
   were now able to produce much more food, he said; A.T.M.s replaced
   tellers, but banks still employ hundreds of thousands of people.
   “Imagine placing a phone call when you had to have someone place a wire
   into a socket for you,” he said. “Being on a switchboard—those were
   good jobs. Every time technology has evolved, yes, individual people
   are impacted. . . . But the standard of living has gone up. I’d rather
   be in the world we’re in today than a world without computers, without
   cell phones, a world without elevators.”

   We walked onto a platform where we could see a track on which the
   mobile robots were lined up, waiting to be called into action.
   Occasionally, one of them would whirr its motor and blast off, like a
   little rocket. Gahagan looked down on his robot army with affection and
   awe. “Depending on who’s in the White House next, you get to the
   fifteen-dollars-an-hour labor or twenty dollars an hour?” Gahagan said.
   “I’m voting for a thirty-dollar-an-hour minimum wage. That’d be
   fantastic marketing for us.”

   If the fully automated warehouse was a structurally different entity
   from its precursors, what about the fully automated factory? Gahagan
   had pointed out that other countries were embracing industrial robotics
   more aggressively than the United States was. I saw the scale of this
   during a recent trip to China. One steamy afternoon, I boarded a bus in
   downtown Shanghai and headed south along the Huangpu River, far from
   the city’s noodle shops and glittering luxury fashion emporiums. About
   half an hour later, I reached a vast, low building, where hundreds of
   bicycles were parked in a covered lot. Inside, I was greeted by Gerry
   Wong, the C.E.O. of Cambridge Industries Group, which manufactures
   telecommunications equipment—more than three million items a month—for
   companies such as Huawei, Nokia, and Alcatel-Lucent. Wong grew up in
   Beijing, studied electrical engineering at M.I.T., and worked at Bell
   Labs for fifteen years. He started C.I.G. in 2005, and says that the
   company produces between two and three million products each month. He
   has the air of an excitable gnome, with a mop of black hair, thick
   seventies-style eyeglasses, and a wicked laugh.

   Wong sat with his back to a wall of dozens of screens, which depicted
   various production metrics and live video of the manufacturing floor,
   where workers—and an increasing number of robots—were fabricating
   circuit boards. (I was there on a trip with a nonprofit called the
   China-U.S. Exchange Foundation.) He quickly demonstrated the lack of
   sentimentality with which many businesspeople in China approach the
   subject of automation. C.I.G. is trying to replace as many human
   workers with robots as possible, he explained. Three or so years ago,
   the company had thirty-five hundred people at work in the factory. Two
   years ago, it was twenty-five hundred. Today, it is eighteen hundred.
   Over the same period, he said proudly, the company’s output had
   doubled.

   “China’s labor costs are increasing, or doubling, every few years,”
   Wong explained. “We are actually overcoming the difficulty by
   increasing our efficiency, through automation.” For Chinese businesses,
   Wong said, lean manufacturing must include industrial automation, and
   they couldn’t make it happen fast enough.

   Much of China’s economic power during the past two decades came from
   its position as the manufacturing engine of the world, but in the past
   several years its growth has started to slow. China was never a
   particularly convenient place for Western companies to have their
   sneakers and T-shirts and widgets made; the main allure was cheap
   labor. With Chinese wages increasing sharply every year, though,
   manufacturing there has become less attractive, and the Chinese
   government is devoting enormous resources to making the country the
   automation capital of the world.

   As we put on gowns, hairnets, and cloth shoe covers in preparation for
   entering the clean manufacturing area, Wong elaborated on China’s need
   for swift automation. There was a labor shortage, he said, exacerbated
   by the longstanding one-child policy. And, as the population has become
   wealthier and the cost of living higher, fewer people were willing to
   do manufacturing work.

   “We are pushing all industries to go to all automation,” Wong said. And
   the employees seemed compliant. “Probably they don’t care very much,
   not like back in the industrial revolution, in Europe, where they would
   go and destroy machines. That was the old days.”

   “They leave, anyway,” Rose Hu, a brisk, blunt woman who works as
   C.I.G.’s senior vice-president of marketing, said. “Every Chinese New
   Year, almost eighty per cent of the people, they will not come back.
   You have to have new.”

   We passed through a pressurized air lock that blasted away whatever
   dust or lint we had on our persons, and entered the clean part of the
   plant. Rows of orderly white machines, tended by workers wearing what
   looked like chef’s hats, were moving circuit boards through the
   assembly line. Robotic arms, behind windows, were doing most of the
   work, while the mortals did tasks that required fine motor skills, like
   plugging tiny components into place. Every now and then, a cute little
   robotic trolley came ambling down an aisle, playing Mozart to alert the
   humans that it was approaching. (Until recently, most industrial robots
   were separated from human workers by steel cages, to protect the
   workers from injury. Now robots that can work alongside humans without
   harming them have come into use.) Two workers hovered at a workstation
   and jammed connectors into holes in a line of circuit boards before
   sending them into a glassed-in chamber, where robotic arms soldered the
   pieces together.

   “There were thirteen people doing this. Now we have only one or two,”
   Hu said, gesturing at the two workers, one man and one woman, both
   young adults. “Before, we used people to solder. We used to have
   sixty-three people to finish one thing, and as of last year we need
   only sixteen people.”

   The circuit boards continued down an automated conveyor belt. Other
   robots placed stickers on boxes, before a group of humans moved in to
   place the circuit boards in the boxes, along with packing materials.
   “Closing the box—this is for some reason hard to automate,” Hu said,
   shaking her head.

   Each time I asked about what happened to the displaced workers, Hu and
   Wong waved away the question, amused at the predictable direction of my
   inquiries. Hu insisted that factory workers would simply find another
   place in the economy, such as the service sector. “We already went
   through several industrial revolutions—and we still have a job!” she
   said. “I think it’s people who haven’t lived through the industrial
   revolution who don’t understand this. The world changes. You constantly
   have to improve yourself to keep up.”

   Later, back in the room with the surveillance monitors, Wong gave me a
   slide show on the history of industrial revolutions. The first phase
   began around 1800, in Wong’s rendering, when the steam engine came into
   use, and was based in Britain, France, and Germany. The second phase,
   in 1900, saw the advent of electricity, and was centered in the U.S.,
   the U.K., and Germany. The third was the information-technology
   revolution, beginning in 2000 and concentrated largely in the U.S.,
   Germany, Japan, and Korea. Wong’s point was that China intended to be
   at the forefront of the fourth phase, which would center on integrating
   robotics and artificial intelligence. Finally, he put up a slide that
   said “The future: ‘Dark Factory.’ ”

   “You don’t need workers, you turn off the lights,” Wong explained,
   chuckling. “Only when an American journalist comes in we turn on the
   light.”

   Stefanie Tellex, the roboticist at Brown University, grew up in a
   conservative Catholic family in a suburb of Rochester that abuts Lake
   Ontario, where, she says, “everyone’s got a house and a yard, and
   there’s no crime.” Her father was an accountant; her mother taught
   second grade in downtown Rochester. Tellex became interested in
   computers as a child. Her father gave her an old DOS 486 when she was
   in grade school; her aunt, a programmer, supplied books of simple
   coding exercises. Tellex was admitted to M.I.T. and planned to pursue a
   liberal-arts degree, but her mother told her that liberal-arts
   graduates didn’t make any money. (“One of the best pieces of advice
   I’ve ever gotten.”) She completed her computer-science Ph.D. there in
   2010. She said that “The Jetsons,” the sixties-era animated TV series,
   helped spark her interest in robots.

   “When I think of A.I., that’s what I think of, the robot,” she said.
   “There’s a scene where they’re drinking smoothies together, the mom and
   the robot, who has a relationship with the family, but on the show
   she’s a servant. And she can do everything you can do.”

   After Winnie completed its petal-plucking tasks in Tellex’s lab, we sat
   down in her office. She told me that she had never thought about the
   political implications of her field until the tense months leading up
   to the 2016 Presidential election. Her parents were Trump voters, and
   she found herself disagreeing with them about what the causes of
   society’s ills were, and what the best solutions might be. She was
   alarmed by the anti-immigrant sentiment emanating from Trump’s rallies,
   especially having spent her adult life surrounded by researchers from
   all over the world. Economic inequality was a driving theme of the
   election, and Tellex began to see that automation was a contributing
   factor. The economy was generating wealth, but almost all of it seemed
   to be going to the wealthy. The official unemployment rate has dropped
   to 4.2 per cent in the United States—its lowest level in ten years—and
   the economy is expanding, but wages for most workers have scarcely
   budged.

   In 2015, the Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton identified
   a surprising data pattern that reflects these economic fault lines,
   finding that mortality rates for middle-aged white non-Hispanic
   Americans with only a high-school diploma have been increasing since
   the late nineteen-nineties. They attribute this trend to “deaths of
   despair” tied to the long-term loss of economic opportunity,
   particularly blue-collar jobs, and to possibly related factors such as
   opioid abuse. Deaton listed globalization, immigration, and
   technological change as likely factors behind the decline of
   middle-income workers and the related rise in inequality, but noted
   that, in the developed world, stagnant wages and an associated increase
   in death rates were unique to the United States. “The political
   explanation is the one that seems to make most sense,” he told me. What
   does he worry about if these trends continue? “How about pitchforks?”
   Deaton said, laughing awkwardly. “I mean, I don’t think this is stable
   politically. The Trump thing is probably just the beginning.”

   Tellex has been conducting her own research into the causes of income
   inequality and, with her friends, has amassed a reading list of
   academic studies and news articles. She is drawn to the idea of a
   universal basic income, in which citizens would receive enough money
   from the government to cover living expenses. Ultimately, she knows,
   blue-collar workers are not the only ones who may need such economic
   assistance. The disruption spurred by automation is not anticipated to
   be limited to low-skilled work; significant encroachments are expected
   in the white-collar sector as well, with experts predicting that
   professionals such as accountants, doctors, lawyers, architects,
   teachers, and journalists will all compete with increasingly capable
   computers in the future.

   There were ways, Tellex believed, to mitigate the effects of rising
   inequality without vilifying immigrants or blaming technology. “I’m one
   of the few people among my friends who regularly talks to Trump
   voters,” she said. “There’s enough money for everyone, I keep telling
   them—there is. It’s just not in your pocket, it’s in the one per cent’s
   pocket. If only we had the right progressive tax system, this wouldn’t
   be such a problem. As a roboticist, I feel a responsibility to
   communicate this to people.”

   For twenty years, Steelcase’s Corporate Development Center was housed
   in a futuristic pyramid-shaped building, which cost more than a hundred
   million dollars to build. It became a landmark of the Grand Rapids
   area; employees returning home from business trips would proudly make
   note of it as their flights descended into the Gerald R. Ford Airport.
   In 2009, in the midst of the financial crisis, Steelcase moved out of
   the building. It sat vacant until 2016, when a company called Switch
   moved in. Switch is a third-party data center, and plans to house giant
   servers there for companies like Disney and eBay.

   Dave Stinson, at Steelcase, told me that he often became emotional when
   he saw the building, and was reminded of what it represented. “It’s
   especially cool at night, when the lights are on,” he said, as a loud
   beeping forklift sound echoed in the background. “I’m getting
   sentimental. It’s a monument for our city. There was talk that they
   were going to tear it down. That would have been a huge loss.”

   After decades on the factory floor, he’s seen enough workers laid off
   to know something about losses. Bill Sandee, his colleague, tries to
   put those losses in perspective. “It was rough to see some of them
   leave,” he told me, referring to the waves of laid-off colleagues.
   “Some of them, their jobs were being eliminated because they just
   didn’t have enough work. And the company has to do something to
   survive. But it’s hard not to take it personally when you’re losing
   your job. You have to go home and tell your wife and kids, ‘I’m out of
   work.’ I remember one engineer saying, ‘I won’t be seeing you anymore,
   Bill, I just got RIF’d.’ It didn’t feel very good.” He paused. “Let’s
   face it, if you love somebody, you care about ’em. So many things in
   our lives are out of our control.”

   That didn’t feel very good, either. Stinson described the time, months
   before the Presidential election, when a friend asked him which
   candidate he was supporting, and he said, “I’m not voting for another
   Bush, and I’m not voting for another Clinton. Period.” The night before
   the election, he and his wife attended a Trump rally in Grand Rapids,
   in the heart of a state that Hillary Clinton had expected to win
   comfortably. More than four thousand people lined up for blocks to hear
   Trump at a downtown convention center. Stinson said he decided that
   night to vote for the Republican ticket. “The way I voted was based on
   the idea that we’re not losing jobs anymore, we’re not doing the NAFTA
   thing,” he said. “I hope he fulfills what he was trying to do when he
   was campaigning and it’s not going to be all broken promises.”

   He was accustomed to politicians disappointing him. Robots hadn’t yet.
   Stinson used to spend his days reminding workers of what they were
   supposed to be doing, or trying to figure out how faulty parts had
   sneaked into the system. He used to jump in and demonstrate precisely
   how a screw was supposed to go in, or whether the torque was correct.
   Now none of that was necessary. Automated machines were driving
   everything. “As opposed to having to train, train, train, train, train,
   making sure you’re getting the muscle memory right,” he said. “It was
   hard, it was stinky, it was ‘I gotta check everything.’ ”

   Back when the factory floor was thick with workers, they used to
   bicker, and Stinson says he was constantly dealing with the drama of
   their personal lives—there were illnesses and feuds and car accidents.
   No longer. The crews are thin; the pressure is less. The youngest of
   his three sons, aged thirty, works in a different department at the
   Steelcase plant. He had dropped out of college, hit hard by his
   grandfather’s death at sixty-five, and Stinson said he had encouraged
   him to go back to school or go into plastics. Still, he said, “He’s
   happy here.”

   Stinson says he is, too. He explained that his line’s productivity had
   shot way up—from a hundred and fifty desk legs a day a year ago to an
   average of eight hundred a day, and growing—which made him feel good.
   “That’s a lot of butts in a lot of seats,” he said. When I asked how
   many new workers Steelcase had hired to accommodate the increase in
   production, he said that workers were mainly being moved between
   production lines, to replace workers who had retired. The company was
   about to install two more automated workstations, though, to
   “accommodate this and future growth.”

   He gazed out at the smoothly functioning factory floor, the rows of
   machines diving and pecking in front of their human minders, performing
   a kind of dance. Even if the economy stayed strong and demand remained
   high the head count was expected to decline through attrition, year
   after year. “It’s got all the technology that you could possibly think
   of,” Stinson told me, when he showed me the vision table. “Until next
   week, when we find something else that we could change to make it
   better.” Automation was bringing greater and greater efficiency, even
   though, at a certain point, the logic of increasing efficiency would
   catch up with him, and he wouldn’t be around any longer to witness it.
   One day, the factory might go dark. In the meantime, he was enjoying
   the advantages of work that involved less work.

   “There were times when I thought I could do something else besides
   this, you know?” he said. “I really like the job a lot better than it
   was. Now I don’t feel overwhelmed anymore.” ♦

   An earlier version of this article misstated the monetary value of the
   trucking industry in the United States.

   When David Stinson finished high school, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in
   1977, the first thing he did was get a job building houses. After a few
   years, though, the business slowed. Stinson was then twenty-four, with
   two children to support. He needed something stable. As he explained
   over lunch recently, that meant finding a job at one of the two
   companies in the area that offered secure, blue-collar work. “Either
   I’ll be working at General Motors or I’ll be working at Steelcase by
   the end of the year,” he vowed in 1984. A few months later, he got a
   job at Steelcase, the world’s largest manufacturer of office furniture,
   and he’s been working at its Grand Rapids metal plant ever since.

Amazon’s New Supermarket Could Be Grim News for Human Workers


    Sheelah Kolhatkar

   January 26, 2018
   Will the technology in Amazon’s new automated grocery store, Amazon Go,
   in Seattle, put millions of retail employees out of work someday?

   When Amazon announced, in June, that it was buying Whole Foods, for
   $13.7 billion, speculation arose about what, exactly, the world’s
   biggest online retailer planned to do with the high-end supermarket
   chain. Amazon had taken steps to enter the business of selling fresh
   food, but it was far from the company’s areas of expertise. Some noted
   that Amazon was, and continues to be, one of the most aggressive
   investors in robotics and artificial-intelligence technology. Six years
   ago, Amazon purchased Kiva, a company that produces mobile robots that
   would make it easier to automate Amazon’s distribution centers,
   potentially saving the company billions of dollars. It seemed obvious
   at the time of the Whole Foods takeover that Amazon could try to
   automate the supermarket chain as well. With the opening this week, in
   Seattle, of the first automated Amazon grocery store, called Amazon Go,
   Jeff Bezos’s vision for the future of the retail industry is fully on
   display—and it’s a vision that involves very few actual human workers.
   What Bezos has created has implications for economists, employers, and
   policymakers, and will surely fuel the debate about automation and the
   future of work.

   As I reported in The New Yorker in October, automation has been
   spreading throughout manufacturing industries around the world,
   introducing technology into assembly lines to take on some of the most
   physically taxing and repetitive work. Robots are often designed to
   initially make human workers’ jobs less stressful and more efficient,
   until the technology evolves to the point at which the roles almost
   reverse. Eventually, the humans are simply helping the machines to
   execute nearly all tasks, sometimes hovering in the background in case
   they break down. At some point after that, the human workers may not be
   needed at all, or at least not in the same ways they have been.

   Retail stores, with their unpredictable physical environments and
   constant customer interactions, by contrast, were seen as far more
   difficult than manufacturing to automate. “Retail is delayed in terms
   of high-tech automation,” Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T. who
   studies automation and the labor market, told me. “You’ve had the more
   clerical parts that have already been automated, such as cashiers and
   so on, but a lot of other areas, such as grocery stores and malls,
   they’re behind manufacturing in terms of introduction of robots,
   because the tasks performed by people there are often more complex.”
   Instead of repeatedly spraying paint onto car-body parts or drilling
   holes into pieces of steel, retail workers are often assisting
   shoppers, answering questions, or restocking shelves. “It’s somewhat
   harder,” Acemoglu said. “At the moment, and probably fortunately, it’s
   not going to lead to wholesale replacement of all the workers.” Still,
   Acemoglu acknowledged, Amazon Go is a signal of what’s to come. Retail
   stores employ 4.8 million people, according to the Bureau of Labor
   Statistics. They, and the millions of others who work in supporting
   roles behind the scenes of retail businesses, stand to be directly
   affected.

   For decades, the conventional belief among economists has been that
   technological advances have created more jobs than (or at least as many
   as) they eliminated, often moving workers into more sophisticated roles
   that couldn’t be automated; bank tellers were largely replaced by
   A.T.M.s, for example, but the number of people employed at banks
   increased nonetheless. In recent years, though, as the fields of
   robotics and A.I. have experienced vast technological leaps, the debate
   has shifted, with many economists acknowledging that the balance of
   jobs created versus jobs eliminated could start moving the other way,
   almost certainly leading to more income inequality.

   The ability to make purchases in a store using (often maddening)
   self-checkout kiosks has existed for some time; the small revolution
   that Amazon Go brings to the experience is the elimination of the
   checkout process altogether. Instead, computers scan shoppers’ phones
   as they enter, and they are then automatically charged for whatever
   items they put into their grocery bags and take home. (The Times said
   that the experience felt like “shoplifting.”) A few human workers still
   float around, to deal with glitches, answer questions, and check the
   I.D. of anyone trying to buy wine. From a consumer standpoint, there
   isn’t much to complain about: if it truly works, the technology could
   turn the chore of grocery shopping into a breezy afterthought, without
   the deadening wait in a long line to pay at the end.

   Acemoglu said that it’s far from preordained whether the technology
   that affords friction-free grocery shopping will put millions of people
   out of work, or simply create opportunities for them to move into other
   kinds of jobs. He said that the answer to that question will be decided
   by politicians and the public-policy choices they make on the tax code,
   education policy, and infrastructure spending, which have far greater
   effects than the actions of any one company—even one as large and
   powerful as Amazon. “These economic and technological conditions that
   are determining where automation is taking us, they are not set in
   stone,” Acemoglu said. “They are societal choices.”

   Acemoglu pointed out that although much is still unknown about the
   relationship between automation and employment, current tax law and
   other government policies have created incentives for employers to
   replace workers with machines, but not machines that could work
   collaboratively with human workers. In a new paper called “Artificial
   Intelligence, Automation and Work,” Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo, of
   Boston University, tried to develop a more precise way to look at the
   connection between automation and jobs. They concluded that automation
   had the potential to create greater wealth while also increasing
   economic inequality. The rise of increasingly powerful machines will
   inevitably reduce the demand for human labor, they say. But, they
   argue, with a commitment to sharing the wealth of the robot economy
   more broadly, and the appropriate investment in education that gives
   workers the skills they need to thrive, increased unemployment and
   inequality could be slowed. The survival of the machines themselves
   might even depend on it. “If we do not find a way of creating shared
   prosperity from the productivity gains generated by AI,” Acemoglu and
   Restrepo write, “there is a danger that the political reaction to these
   new technologies may slow down or even completely stop their adoption
   and development.”

   When Amazon announced, in June, that it was buying Whole Foods, for
   $13.7 billion, speculation arose about what, exactly, the world’s
   biggest online retailer planned to do with the high-end supermarket
   chain. Amazon had taken steps to enter the business of selling fresh
   food, but it was far from the company’s areas of expertise. Some noted
   that Amazon was, and continues to be, one of the most aggressive
   investors in robotics and artificial-intelligence technology. Six years
   ago, Amazon purchased Kiva, a company that produces mobile robots that
   would make it easier to automate Amazon’s distribution centers,
   potentially saving the company billions of dollars. It seemed obvious
   at the time of the Whole Foods takeover that Amazon could try to
   automate the supermarket chain as well. With the opening this week, in
   Seattle, of the first automated Amazon grocery store, called Amazon Go,
   Jeff Bezos’s vision for the future of the retail industry is fully on
   display—and it’s a vision that involves very few actual human workers.
   What Bezos has created has implications for economists, employers, and
   policymakers, and will surely fuel the debate about automation and the
   future of work.
