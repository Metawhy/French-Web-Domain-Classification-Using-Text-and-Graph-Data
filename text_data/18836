A 3-D Underwater Soundscape

A large-scale experiment sheds light on sound in the coastal ocean

   By Amy Nevala / Lonny Lippsett | August 2, 2007

   It was the largest oceanographic field experiment in the 76-year
   history of  Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Most research
   projects employ one ship and a dozen or so researchers; this one
   involved a fleet of six research vessels, more than 50 scientists from
   12 institutions, 62 moorings, 350 assorted oceanographic sensors,
   nearly 100 tons of equipment, as well as an airplane, space satellites,
   and a squad of robotic undersea gliders.

   Over seven weeks in the summer of 2006, all of that inventory was
   focused on a 40-by-50-square-kilometer (24-by-31-square-mile) patch of
   ocean about 100 miles east of Atlantic City, N.J. The goal: to assemble
   a spatially three-dimensional, highly detailed picture of how sound
   waves travel through the complex, ever-changing medium of coastal
   waters.

   Those who work in these complicated ocean waters need to know how their
   instruments operate in them. So a consortium of three sponsors from the
   Office of Naval Research (ONR)—representing interests in acoustics,
   physical oceanography, and vehicles—pooled funds, experimental
   resources, and scientists to attempt a large-scale experiment to
   collect the fundamental data needed. Their goal was to advance basic
   understanding of sound propagation in a 3-D coastal ocean. Adding the
   third dimension potentially squares the amount of equipment required,
   as well as the costs, so this was an ambitious undertaking, even with
   pooled resources, said Jim Lynch, an acoustics expert and senior
   scientist at WHOI, who co-led the experiment.

   “Coordination of such a huge effort would be a small logistical
   nightmare, and we knew that a hurricane or fishing activity could wipe
   out the project at any time,” Lynch said. “But the potential payoff was
   extraordinary. A look at the third dimension with fine resolution,
   acoustically and oceanographically, was worth a shot.”

From deep to shallow

   Unlike light, sound propagates efficiently through water, making sound
   the primary way for people to “see” beneath the waves. Sound is used by
   scientists, industries, navies, and others to communicate under water,
   to monitor the ocean’s moving water masses, to get images of the
   seafloor and structures beneath it, and to localize and track sources
   of sound in the ocean.

   The Navy has long used sound to detect objects under water. During the
   Cold War, it deployed acoustic systems all across the Northern
   Hemisphere to monitor submarines that lurked in the deep ocean. In deep
   water, sound waves do not interact with the ocean bottom, and they
   propagate through large, stable, slowly varying oceanographic
   features.  Shallow waters, however, are anything but stable, simple, or
   predictable, making it harder to understand how sound propagates
   through them.

   The first confounding factor in shallow water, almost by definition, is
   the ocean bottom, which significantly interacts with and reflects sound
   waves. Sound waves reflect differently off seafloors having different
   topographies and compositions.

   The ocean also interacts with the atmosphere, and its surface is warmed
   or cooled by weather systems that change daily and seasonally. This
   produces water masses or layers near the surface that often have
   substantially different temperatures than deeper waters. These water
   masses change how sound travels through the shallow waters. The
   10-to-50-meter-thick surface water masses are almost insignificant to
   sound in the deep ocean, which extends thousands of meters deep; but in
   coastal waters with depths of only about 200 meters, they have large
   impacts.

   Shallow waters also have more water masses that don’t mix and that
   constantly jostle against each other, creating the oceanic equivalent
   of atmospheric cold and warm fronts. Sound travels more easily through
   cold water, but refracts away from warm water. Some of these fronts are
   relatively stationary, fixed features, whereas others are swept along
   by currents and tides. Occasionally, swirling ocean eddies of various
   sizes travel through shallow waters, adding another layer of
   complication.

   As if all this weren’t complex enough, tides and topography in shallow
   water create waves within the ocean’s interior—so-called “internal
   waves,” which have important impacts on underwater acoustics (as well
   as many other areas of ocean study).

   All this variable oceanography—coupled with complicated and irregular
   ocean bottoms, and topped off with a sea surface cluttered with ships
   and waves—serves to scatter, reflect, dissipate, interfere with,
   channel and generally increase the uncertainty of predicting how sound
   waves travel in shallow water.

Chirps, whooshes, and beeps

   Planning for the experiment began in 2001 at WHOI, the University of
   Washington, and other research institutions. Acousticians,
   oceanographers, geologists, oceanographic vehicle developers, and other
   scientists assembled their expertise and resources to conduct a
   concentrated acoustics and oceanography study in a rectangle of ocean
   off New Jersey, whose geology, currents, and water characteristics had
   already been well-studied over the past decade.

   “This was an opportunity to continue building on that accumulated body
   of knowledge, using the latest technology and research advancements,”
   said Ellen Livingston, program manager of the Ocean Acoustics Program
   at ONR.

   That area’s proximity to WHOI made it convenient and affordable to
   study. Yet any fundamental shallow-water acoustics knowledge obtained
   there would be “transportable” anywhere in the world—to continental
   shelves in more far-flung locales, such as the Arabian Sea, for
   example.

   “Shallow Water ’06” began in full on July 24, 2006, when WHOI engineer
   John Kemp and a team of mooring specialists finished loading the
   WHOI-operated vessel Knorr with nearly 200,000 pounds of equipment.
   That included some 90,000 pounds of anchors to secure moorings to the
   seafloor.

   The moorings were mounted with instruments to measure temperature,
   salinity, currents, pressure, and other ocean characteristics. They
   also had devices to transmit and receive sound signals through the
   ocean and to record sounds emitted by shipboard sources, the ships
   themselves, and marine animals. The sounds produced for the
   experiment—an amusing assortment of chirps, whooshes, and beeps
   (including one that sounded quite rude)— were scrupulously kept below
   decibel levels believed to affect marine mammals, based on the latest
   research.

A well-orchestrated experiment

   The team placed some moorings 100 meters apart and others several miles
   apart in a carefully arranged T-shaped pattern that stretched both
   along and across the continental shelf. At the junction of the “T,” a
   3-D array of oceanography sensors was deployed to examine fine-scale
   patterns of ocean internal waves, a key topic of interest for both
   Lynch and the experiment.

   Things did not begin auspiciously. On the first mooring to be deployed,
   a critical microprocessor on the main acoustic receiver array
   malfunctioned, threatening to compromise the experiment. But the
   researchers managed to repair it at sea and went on to position 57
   moorings over five days, in advance of other scientists arriving via
   research vessels. (Five other moorings came later.) The T-shaped
   mooring array, continually collecting ocean and acoustic data, served
   as the foundation for many researchers.

   “We were on deck at 6 a.m., deploying about one mooring every hour and
   working until seven each night,” said Kemp, the project’s logistics
   coordinator. Karen Johnson, a cook aboard Knorr who also photographed
   the expeditions, said the carefully coordinated deployment of 200,000
   pounds of equipment from the vessel’s deck into the North Atlantic
   “suggested an orchestral arrangement. … Watching Kemp and his group
   with their hand signals and synchronized movements was like watching
   masterful artists.”

   “I’ve been on expeditions with two or three other ships, maybe a few
   research instruments, and they were considered huge,” said Kemp, a
   28-year veteran at WHOI. “Other projects I’ve worked on were small
   potatoes. This project was nothing short of daunting.”

   Arthur Newhall, a project coordinator and acoustics data specialist at
   WHOI, said the project explored “at least four times the number of
   research questions we’re usually dealing with.”
   Lynch joked that “we put so much equipment in the water, we probably
   raised mean sea level.”

Rules of the road

   Success of the scientists’ project rested critically on the security of
   the moorings, which Kemp feared would be dragged up by unsuspecting
   fishermen who flock to the region each summer for lobster, scallops,
   and tuna. The scientists alerted their fellow seafarers by both modern
   means (sending text messages to fishermen) and ancient, well-proven
   ways (marking the moorings with orange flags).

   Another “traffic hazard” was fellow scientists. It wasn’t unusual for
   two or more research vessels to be working in the area at the same
   time; they stayed out of each other’s way using a Web site that tagged
   mooring positions and ship and glider tracks and gave daily updates of
   each other’s research status and intended ship tracks. Each day,
   scientists and engineers aboard the various ships exchanged data via
   e-mail.

   One report of a mooring dragged to the surface did have scientists
   briefly on edge, Kemp said. “It turned out that what the person saw
   wasn’t our moorings, but actually a bunch of balloons that had been
   released from a cruise ship and were floating around,” he said.  “I’m
   happy to report that we brought back every mooring.”

A scientific bounty

   By mid-September, when Shallow Water ’06 concluded, its participants
   were “both exhausted and deliriously happy,” Lynch said. “Murphy took a
   few weeks off, and the sea gods and goddesses smiled on us. It was
   totally unbelievable. That much equipment, that many people, that many
   experimental components—and it all bloody worked!”

   “WHOI did a great job of providing complex data-collection capabilities
   of the highest scientific standards,” Livingston said.  “That’s not
   easy to do in the ocean, and WHOI made it happen.”

   The main acoustic array alone brought back six terabytes of data, Lynch
   said, and the other ocean sensors, acoustic arrays, aircraft, and
   satellites will likely double that. Over the coming years, this
   cornucopia of new observations should provide the grist for the
   acousticians, physical oceanographers, geologists, and engineers
   involved in Shallow Water ’06 to make significant leaps in
   understanding the shallow-water environment.

   “I think we’re going to see things we’ve never been able to see
   before,” Lynch said.   “Let me use my own research as an example.”

   Although the ocean often scatters sound energy almost randomly to
   create a “messy” acoustic picture, he explained, regular ocean
   features—such as ocean fronts or internal waves— can trap sound,
   allowing it to propagate more efficiently and perhaps amplify local
   noise levels.

   “This can affect the ranges over which marine mammals can hear and be
   heard and how well sonars can work,” Lynch said.

   In addition, curved internal waves can perhaps “bend the sound paths
   horizontally” to create both an efficient sound pipeline between the
   waves and also a rainbow dispersion pattern for sound that escapes the
   pipeline, Lynch said. “All this structure and variability in the
   shallow ocean should be quantifiable to a good extent, and it is our
   job to do this.”

   Funding for this research was provided by the Office of Naval Research,
   the Defense University Research Instrumentation Program, Rutgers
   University, and the Naval Research Laboratory.

A 3-D Underwater Soundscape

A large-scale experiment sheds light on sound in the coastal ocean

   By Amy Nevala / Lonny Lippsett | August 2, 2007

   It was the largest oceanographic field experiment in the 76-year
   history of  Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Most research
   projects employ one ship and a dozen or so researchers; this one
   involved a fleet of six research vessels, more than 50 scientists from
   12 institutions, 62 moorings, 350 assorted oceanographic sensors,
   nearly 100 tons of equipment, as well as an airplane, space satellites,
   and a squad of robotic undersea gliders.

   Over seven weeks in the summer of 2006, all of that inventory was
   focused on a 40-by-50-square-kilometer (24-by-31-square-mile) patch of
   ocean about 100 miles east of Atlantic City, N.J. The goal: to assemble
   a spatially three-dimensional, highly detailed picture of how sound
   waves travel through the complex, ever-changing medium of coastal
   waters.

   Those who work in these complicated ocean waters need to know how their
   instruments operate in them. So a consortium of three sponsors from the
   Office of Naval Research (ONR)—representing interests in acoustics,
   physical oceanography, and vehicles—pooled funds, experimental
   resources, and scientists to attempt a large-scale experiment to
   collect the fundamental data needed. Their goal was to advance basic
   understanding of sound propagation in a 3-D coastal ocean. Adding the
   third dimension potentially squares the amount of equipment required,
   as well as the costs, so this was an ambitious undertaking, even with
   pooled resources, said Jim Lynch, an acoustics expert and senior
   scientist at WHOI, who co-led the experiment.

   “Coordination of such a huge effort would be a small logistical
   nightmare, and we knew that a hurricane or fishing activity could wipe
   out the project at any time,” Lynch said. “But the potential payoff was
   extraordinary. A look at the third dimension with fine resolution,
   acoustically and oceanographically, was worth a shot.”

From deep to shallow

   Unlike light, sound propagates efficiently through water, making sound
   the primary way for people to “see” beneath the waves. Sound is used by
   scientists, industries, navies, and others to communicate under water,
   to monitor the ocean’s moving water masses, to get images of the
   seafloor and structures beneath it, and to localize and track sources
   of sound in the ocean.

   The Navy has long used sound to detect objects under water. During the
   Cold War, it deployed acoustic systems all across the Northern
   Hemisphere to monitor submarines that lurked in the deep ocean. In deep
   water, sound waves do not interact with the ocean bottom, and they
   propagate through large, stable, slowly varying oceanographic
   features.  Shallow waters, however, are anything but stable, simple, or
   predictable, making it harder to understand how sound propagates
   through them.

   The first confounding factor in shallow water, almost by definition, is
   the ocean bottom, which significantly interacts with and reflects sound
   waves. Sound waves reflect differently off seafloors having different
   topographies and compositions.

   The ocean also interacts with the atmosphere, and its surface is warmed
   or cooled by weather systems that change daily and seasonally. This
   produces water masses or layers near the surface that often have
   substantially different temperatures than deeper waters. These water
   masses change how sound travels through the shallow waters. The
   10-to-50-meter-thick surface water masses are almost insignificant to
   sound in the deep ocean, which extends thousands of meters deep; but in
   coastal waters with depths of only about 200 meters, they have large
   impacts.

   Shallow waters also have more water masses that don’t mix and that
   constantly jostle against each other, creating the oceanic equivalent
   of atmospheric cold and warm fronts. Sound travels more easily through
   cold water, but refracts away from warm water. Some of these fronts are
   relatively stationary, fixed features, whereas others are swept along
   by currents and tides. Occasionally, swirling ocean eddies of various
   sizes travel through shallow waters, adding another layer of
   complication.

   As if all this weren’t complex enough, tides and topography in shallow
   water create waves within the ocean’s interior—so-called “internal
   waves,” which have important impacts on underwater acoustics (as well
   as many other areas of ocean study).

   All this variable oceanography—coupled with complicated and irregular
   ocean bottoms, and topped off with a sea surface cluttered with ships
   and waves—serves to scatter, reflect, dissipate, interfere with,
   channel and generally increase the uncertainty of predicting how sound
   waves travel in shallow water.

Chirps, whooshes, and beeps

   Planning for the experiment began in 2001 at WHOI, the University of
   Washington, and other research institutions. Acousticians,
   oceanographers, geologists, oceanographic vehicle developers, and other
   scientists assembled their expertise and resources to conduct a
   concentrated acoustics and oceanography study in a rectangle of ocean
   off New Jersey, whose geology, currents, and water characteristics had
   already been well-studied over the past decade.

   “This was an opportunity to continue building on that accumulated body
   of knowledge, using the latest technology and research advancements,”
   said Ellen Livingston, program manager of the Ocean Acoustics Program
   at ONR.

   That area’s proximity to WHOI made it convenient and affordable to
   study. Yet any fundamental shallow-water acoustics knowledge obtained
   there would be “transportable” anywhere in the world—to continental
   shelves in more far-flung locales, such as the Arabian Sea, for
   example.

   “Shallow Water ’06” began in full on July 24, 2006, when WHOI engineer
   John Kemp and a team of mooring specialists finished loading the
   WHOI-operated vessel Knorr with nearly 200,000 pounds of equipment.
   That included some 90,000 pounds of anchors to secure moorings to the
   seafloor.

   The moorings were mounted with instruments to measure temperature,
   salinity, currents, pressure, and other ocean characteristics. They
   also had devices to transmit and receive sound signals through the
   ocean and to record sounds emitted by shipboard sources, the ships
   themselves, and marine animals. The sounds produced for the
   experiment—an amusing assortment of chirps, whooshes, and beeps
   (including one that sounded quite rude)— were scrupulously kept below
   decibel levels believed to affect marine mammals, based on the latest
   research.

A well-orchestrated experiment

   The team placed some moorings 100 meters apart and others several miles
   apart in a carefully arranged T-shaped pattern that stretched both
   along and across the continental shelf. At the junction of the “T,” a
   3-D array of oceanography sensors was deployed to examine fine-scale
   patterns of ocean internal waves, a key topic of interest for both
   Lynch and the experiment.

   Things did not begin auspiciously. On the first mooring to be deployed,
   a critical microprocessor on the main acoustic receiver array
   malfunctioned, threatening to compromise the experiment. But the
   researchers managed to repair it at sea and went on to position 57
   moorings over five days, in advance of other scientists arriving via
   research vessels. (Five other moorings came later.) The T-shaped
   mooring array, continually collecting ocean and acoustic data, served
   as the foundation for many researchers.

   “We were on deck at 6 a.m., deploying about one mooring every hour and
   working until seven each night,” said Kemp, the project’s logistics
   coordinator. Karen Johnson, a cook aboard Knorr who also photographed
   the expeditions, said the carefully coordinated deployment of 200,000
   pounds of equipment from the vessel’s deck into the North Atlantic
   “suggested an orchestral arrangement. … Watching Kemp and his group
   with their hand signals and synchronized movements was like watching
   masterful artists.”

   “I’ve been on expeditions with two or three other ships, maybe a few
   research instruments, and they were considered huge,” said Kemp, a
   28-year veteran at WHOI. “Other projects I’ve worked on were small
   potatoes. This project was nothing short of daunting.”

   Arthur Newhall, a project coordinator and acoustics data specialist at
   WHOI, said the project explored “at least four times the number of
   research questions we’re usually dealing with.”
   Lynch joked that “we put so much equipment in the water, we probably
   raised mean sea level.”

Rules of the road

   Success of the scientists’ project rested critically on the security of
   the moorings, which Kemp feared would be dragged up by unsuspecting
   fishermen who flock to the region each summer for lobster, scallops,
   and tuna. The scientists alerted their fellow seafarers by both modern
   means (sending text messages to fishermen) and ancient, well-proven
   ways (marking the moorings with orange flags).

   Another “traffic hazard” was fellow scientists. It wasn’t unusual for
   two or more research vessels to be working in the area at the same
   time; they stayed out of each other’s way using a Web site that tagged
   mooring positions and ship and glider tracks and gave daily updates of
   each other’s research status and intended ship tracks. Each day,
   scientists and engineers aboard the various ships exchanged data via
   e-mail.

   One report of a mooring dragged to the surface did have scientists
   briefly on edge, Kemp said. “It turned out that what the person saw
   wasn’t our moorings, but actually a bunch of balloons that had been
   released from a cruise ship and were floating around,” he said.  “I’m
   happy to report that we brought back every mooring.”

A scientific bounty

   By mid-September, when Shallow Water ’06 concluded, its participants
   were “both exhausted and deliriously happy,” Lynch said. “Murphy took a
   few weeks off, and the sea gods and goddesses smiled on us. It was
   totally unbelievable. That much equipment, that many people, that many
   experimental components—and it all bloody worked!”

   “WHOI did a great job of providing complex data-collection capabilities
   of the highest scientific standards,” Livingston said.  “That’s not
   easy to do in the ocean, and WHOI made it happen.”

   The main acoustic array alone brought back six terabytes of data, Lynch
   said, and the other ocean sensors, acoustic arrays, aircraft, and
   satellites will likely double that. Over the coming years, this
   cornucopia of new observations should provide the grist for the
   acousticians, physical oceanographers, geologists, and engineers
   involved in Shallow Water ’06 to make significant leaps in
   understanding the shallow-water environment.

   “I think we’re going to see things we’ve never been able to see
   before,” Lynch said.   “Let me use my own research as an example.”

   Although the ocean often scatters sound energy almost randomly to
   create a “messy” acoustic picture, he explained, regular ocean
   features—such as ocean fronts or internal waves— can trap sound,
   allowing it to propagate more efficiently and perhaps amplify local
   noise levels.

   “This can affect the ranges over which marine mammals can hear and be
   heard and how well sonars can work,” Lynch said.

   In addition, curved internal waves can perhaps “bend the sound paths
   horizontally” to create both an efficient sound pipeline between the
   waves and also a rainbow dispersion pattern for sound that escapes the
   pipeline, Lynch said. “All this structure and variability in the
   shallow ocean should be quantifiable to a good extent, and it is our
   job to do this.”

   Funding for this research was provided by the Office of Naval Research,
   the Defense University Research Instrumentation Program, Rutgers
   University, and the Naval Research Laboratory.
