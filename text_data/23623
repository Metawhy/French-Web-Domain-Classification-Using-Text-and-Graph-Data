Can I get your autograph?

   I wrote a lame title for this post and I just couldn’t bring myself to
     use it but it’s dorky enough that it seemed a shame not to share.
                                   Ready?

                             Vintage Junk Rocks!

   [OPEN%2BSHELVES%2Bwm.jpg]

     Random junk photo taken on the same day as the other photos in this
                                   post...

   Ok, I’ve probably written worse but if you knew how much over-thinking
      I put into things, you’d understand why I consider that kind of
   cringe-worthy and once/if you read this post (unless that last sentence
   was enough to make you turn off your computer or put down your phone or
       abandon your tablet and leave the area) you’ll understand how
     lacking-in-subtlety (yet easy) that title would have been.  For me.

                   Did I mention the over-thinking? Good.

                                     So.

   [HARDWARE%2Bwm.jpg]

                            Ditto on this photo.

    There’s been a series of totally random yet very delightful emails
     showing up around The Land of Into Vintage lately and here’s one
                                  example:

   Hello,
   I was wondering if you would be interested in letting us use the
   attached photo on an album cover for a small up and coming band called
   Surviving Allison. It will be used in good taste, and we would give you
   full credit for the photo on the album.

                                   What?!

    You may recall a post from back in the olden days when I took myself
     out for some birthday junking and snapped these photos while in an
     antique mall in Astoria, OR (Hi there, Phog Bounders Antique Mall).

   [MALL%2BDISPLAY%2B1%2Bwm.jpg]

    Then that random-yet-delightful email arrived and before I responded,
      mad googling commenced in order to check out the band, Surviving
    Allison.  I just wanted to make sure they don't sacrifice unicorns or
                             anything like that.

                                 They don't.

            And so my response to the email was a big, ol’ YES.

                   Days later, this appeared in my inbox.

   [Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-15%2Bat%2B11.27.08%2BAM.jpg]

    The designer told me each object with a sales tag represents a member
                                of the band.

               No words except maybe “Vintage junk rocks!”

                      Or follow them on Instagram here.

                    ------------------------------------

     P.S. a HUMONGOUS thank you to everyone who took the time to wish my
   dear Auntie a happy birthday on my previous post. You are the best. xo

Mile marker 90.

    Please indulge me while I type up this tribute to a favorite vintage
                person who also happens to be very modern…

   She is someone who defines optimism as “…an 80+ year old woman who
                   renews her passport.” (And uses it!)

      She’s on Facebook. She’s an email pro and has been for years.

         She knows what in the world airbnb* is and finds it pretty
                                interesting.

                             She takes selfies!

                              [food%2Bcart.jpg]

   Selfie taken while dining on roasted duck & fig crepes from "Planet of
                            the Crepes" food cart

     She has a resume that contains the following titles: Award-winning
     Author, Gourmet Chef, Restaurant Review Writer, Business Owner, and
     Hotel Social Director.  (There are more. This is just the highlight
                                   reel. )

   [broadmoor.jpg]

           Former Social Director at the beautiful Broadmoor Hotel

             She found her great love at age 80 and married him.

       She is a tireless cheerleader for reconnecting far-flung family
                                  members.

   She induces anxiety by asking this visiting short order cook to prepare
      dinner for her. (See previous reference to “Gourmet Chef” and
         “Restaurant Review Writer.”  Sheer terror, I tell you.)

   [2014-05-21%2B23.18.59.jpg]

                      Celebrating something or another

      She reduces anxiety by introducing visiting short order cooks to
                     Prosecco, Limoncello, and Bellinis.

    She shares a rare genetic disorder with yours truly that involves the
     acquisition of pretty vintage dishes. So many dishes. We can’t be
                       stopped but probably should be.

   [limoges.JPG]

    She appreciates beauty all around her, especially in her home and her
                                   garden.

   She dresses so stylishly that someone needs to put her on the pages of
                                   Vogue.
   She reads my blog, refers to me as a writer and encourages and supports
                            all of my endeavors.

     All of this (and much, much more) describes my Auntie Phyllis, who
                               turns 90 today.

    I would love and appreciate it so much if you would please wish her a
        “Happy Birthday” in the comments below.  Thank you.  ♥

The vintage Pyrex
casserole-with-see-through-stand-and-warming-basket-in-mint-condition-shaped
hole in my head.

    For someone who rides the junkin’ rails on a nearly daily basis, I
             completely managed to miss the train to Pyrexville.

   I realize many of you Pyrex People have been bringing home mixing bowls
    and refrigerator sets for eons but for those of us just waking up to
    the Pyrex experience (HelloMyNameIsAmy), I feel as though in the last
     year or so, there has been a sudden EXPLOSION of Pyrex collecting,
                       hoarding, sharing and selling.

   Or does everyone feel like that when they're the last one to catch on?

   [vintagejunkinmytrunk.jpg]

                  Gina has vintage Pyrex junk in her trunk.

   [melissa.JPG]

                   Melissa sells her Pyrex finds on eBay.

   [sisters.jpg]

   Then there are the Two (Pyrex Crazy) Thrifting Sisters. A google image
                    search of them is Pyrex-crazy indeed!

   [PyrexCollectiveI.png]

                 Click the photo to go to Pyrex Collective I

   And there’s not just one or even two Pyrex Collectives – there are
     three of them! With links to even more Pyrex-loving types pyrexing
                              their hearts out.

   [PyrexCollectiveII.png]

                Click the photo to go to Pyrex Collective II

   [PyrexCollectiveIII.png]
   and you guessed it, click the photo to go to Pyrex Collective III

                                   And me?

   I’ve taken one lonely photo of other people’s Pyrex, because I liked
        the display, not because I have a clue about anything Pyrex.

   [instagram.png]

   On Instagram, this is my #1 hearted photo -- it outhearted any Vintage
   Christmas photo I’ve posted so far -- who knew?! I mean, you probably
    knew but I DID NOT KNOW. About the w i d e s p r e a d love of Pyrex.

   In an effort to signal my late entry into the Great Pyrex Awareness of
    the 21^st Century, I’ve started a Pyrex (and more) collection of my
  own, safely contained on a Pinterest board where it won’t take up space
        at home, be washed in a dishwasher or get chipped or broken.

   [ETSY.jpg]

                Pyrex poster is from etsy shop Pocono Modern

     Live and learn.  SO much to learn.  Now hoping to find a Pyrex for
                          Beginners support group.

I need to know.

     Before I get started here let me just say that this much I already
      know:  I am a vintage dish junkie and therefore have NO BUSINESS
    whatsoever prowling around the dish aisle of a Goodwill thrift store
  BUT once I’m in the store I feel it’s my moral obligation to check out
     every. single. aisle. including the one with the lame used sporting
   goods (deflated soccer ball or random golf clubs anyone?) and so there
                                   I was.

    Doing my civic duty in the dish aisle. In the name of junking. Which
                      sounds an awful lot like junkie.

   [PILOE+OF+PLATES+wm.jpg]

   For the most part I kept my hands to myself but while eavesdropping on
        two people discussing Pyrex (free continuing ed class over in
       housewares!)  I spied some pretty little plates and here comes
   a(nother) confession:  I have become THAT PERSON. The one who whips out
    her phone in Goodwill to google the item in her hand before making a
   potentially heinous mistake involving fours of dollars by taking a pass
   on something that maybe she should have bought but didn’t.  Because of
                       the fours of dollars involved.

  And now I’m also that person who refers to herself in the third person.

                        And it was just four dollars.

  I really don’t know how to explain that part of the equation. It’s not
          like they cost forty dollars because then PROBLEM SOLVED.

   [MARKS+wm.jpg]

                             The tipping point.

        Back to the dishes. The magical, pretty dishes that had many
    interesting things happening. A nautical theme. Not one but two marks
    on the back (mad googling begins here!) and those marks involved the
   words ENGLAND and FAMOUS ARTISTS. Surely those are good signs. And the
   crazing. I love crazing. And they were pretty. And I’d never seen them
                        before. And they were pretty.

   [CRAZING+B.jpg+wm.jpg]

                             Oh that crazing...

                          Hands over four dollars.

      Despite my frenzied googling at the store and later again when my
   dishes and I got home, I still couldn’t determine specifically who the
  “famous artists” were and somehow not knowing disturbs me.  If I were
  putting the works of “famous artists” on my merchandise (and adding a
      second china mark specifically explaining that they were made by
   “famous artists”), I would say in BIG HUGE LETTERS who the “famous
                               artists” are.

   [5a0ac653-acec-473b-8dc6-e51b3bbdb19a_zps9264c5e7.JPG]

                      A painting by a "famous artist."

      And now I feel as though the internet is keeping secrets from me.
   Because everything about everything is on the internet by now, isn’t
                                     it?

                            I will keep looking.

On getting keyed up at an estate sale

    Last weekend netted one of my dream scenario estate sales. All of my
      lax, random criteria were met or exceeded: family run, out in the
    country, piles to pick through, displayed nicely but not too nicely,
      very reasonably priced and there were OUTBUILDINGS (2 of them!).

   [SIGNS+wm.jpg]

                          So many campground signs.

     Bonus! (and possible new criteria): The sale was being run by four
                             handsome brothers.

   There was just one little flaw at this otherwise perfect sale and I’ll
                   simply refer to that as The Barnacle.*

     While passing by the giant FREE pile on my way to the good stuff in
    Building #1, The Barnacle, who had stacked her purchases next to the
 free pile, greeted me by saying, “Don’t touch those! They’re mine!”
       even though the only touching was WITH MY EYES as I walked by.

   [NUMBERS+wm.jpg]

                           So many enamel numbers.

       I filled a box with my purchases and left it with brother #3 in
    building #1 while I headed to building #2 which was manned by brother
                                     #4.

     Years of experience with [DEL: sleeping in :DEL] arriving at estate
   sales hours after they’ve opened has forced me to fine-tune my ability
    to detect things that were missed or skipped over by earlier buyers.

   [KEYS+RING+B+wm.jpg]

                        So many interesting old keys.

    I reached for a massive ring of keys that had been overlooked because
   it was hanging between studs on a garage wall and *like magic* there at
   my elbow was The Barnacle. She hovered behind me to see if I was buying
   the keys while her husband yelled out from across the garage, “Hon! I
   can’t believe you missed those keys your first time through here.”

                                 Sorry, Hon.

     I now had an estate sale shadow following me and I didn't know why
     since The Barnacle appeared to have been finished with her shopping
    when I arrived. Maybe it caused her anxiety to see me swooping in and
      making piles of the things she rejected. Maybe she thought I knew
    something about the junk that she didn’t. Maybe missing out on that
        ring of keys caused her to question all of her life choices.
                              We'll never know.

   [SUN+WATCHES+wm.jpg]

     So many Wheaties cereal prizes - Frank Buck explorer's sun watches.

     I do know at this point there were only two shoppers in this 3-car
   garage, myself and The Barnacle, and as I dug through a very small box,
   she suddenly appeared again, standingrightnexttome, and stuck her hands
      in the same small box where my hands were already busy rummaging.

                      What exactly was happening here?!

    Much to my surprise, my outside voice, which would usually try for a
   more diplomatic approach at first, just blurted out “Are you stalking
                           me?”  #personalspace

                        And I was completely ignored.

                 At this point I had to make some decisions.

       Should I get into a Barnacle-Stalker girl fight in a (handsome)
                   stranger’s garage at an estate sale?

              No. Because that is a completely ridiculous idea.

   [LICENSE+PLATES+wm.jpg]

                So many old Pacific Northwest license plates.

    But if I did, would it affect my ability to buy the stuff I had left
               behind with (handsome) Brother #3 in garage #1?

                    Probably. And that would be NOT GOOD.

               Could The Barnacle take me down pretty easily?

     ABSOLUTELY. Small rambunctious pets have knocked me over. I was no
                               match for her.

              So I stepped away from the box and The Barnacle.

    Why? Because there is so much junk in the world, more than enough for
   everyone, that it’s just not worth being another Barnacle at an estate
                  sale. And I’m more than okay with that.

   [PILE+OF+KEYS+wm.jpg]

              I did buy the keys. All 446 of them. Sorry, Hon.

                            ---------------------

Painting a picture while asking you questions

                           Imagine if you will…

     It’s summer – possibly June or July. The weather is warm if not
   downright hot.  The gardens are planted, flowers are blooming, tomatoes
   are ripening and there’s a song in your heart and a smile on your face
    because you’re planning to attend an amazing vintage event over the
     weekend to shop for something specific or perhaps for everything in
                       general (my preferred method).

   [AVG+wm.jpg]

     With that in mind, let me ask you this:  How would you feel if you
   turned a corner at this hypothetical summertime vintage event and came
                         across something like this?

   [VINTAGE+CHRISTMAS+4+wm.jpg]

    Please do not attempt to adjust your eyeballs. This photo is blurry.

                                  Or this?

   [VINTAGE+CHRISTMAS+2+wm.jpg]

                                   Or this?

   [VINTAGE+CHRISTMAS+5+wm.jpg]

                          I brake for Shiny Brites.

                      Would you stop and shop? In July?

    Would you need to put your head between your knees and count to 10 to
        avoid passing out? (No, wait, that’s not you. That’s me).

   [VINTAGE+CHRISTMAS+1+wm.jpg]

    I’m curious to know if anyone else shops for vintage Christmas year
                              round like I do?

  I did mention there would be questions, didn’t I? See, there’s another
                                    one.

     I know if I came across a vendor in a middle-of-the-summer vintage
    event (or even during a regular non-holiday-season visit to a vintage
     mall), who was dedicated solely to vintage Christmas, regardless of
     what might be on my shopping list, I would stop dead in my tracks.

   [VINTAGE+CHRISTMAS+6+wm.jpg]

                   More [DEL: blurriness :DEL] shiny-ness.

   But maybe that’s just me. Shopping year round for vintage Christmas is
              one of those things that feels perfectly normal.*

           OR… maybe it’s not just me.  Maybe it’s you too.

    Maybe we’re all in the same secret, sparkly, shiny club and don’t
                                 realize it!

    And so because I know how I feel about the topic of vintage Christmas
     year round, I wonder how you might feel about it and would greatly
    appreciate any [DEL: enabling :DEL] feedback you’d like to provide.

   [VINTAGE+CHRISTMAS+3+wm.jpg]

                   Thank you and Merry Vintage Christmas.

                          -------------------------

  * Disclaimer: I acknowledge that it’s entirely possible I may have lost
                   my grip on “normal” some time ago.

     PS I took the Christmas photos shown here in late 2013 when Magpie
   Ethel and I combined our vintage Christmas hoards at Monticello Antique
    Marketplace.  She wrote a fun post about it and you can CLICK HERE to
                         read it. Lots of eye candy.

The post about Farm Chicks 2014 that involves way too many asterisks* (and
quite a few parentheses)

   [FARM+CHICKS+SILO+wm.png]
   Every person attending has a version of this photo on their phone. It's
   Farm Chicks law.

      After several hours of driving and Skittles-eating, my traveling
     companion, Pam, and I arrived at the Farm Chicks Antique Show a few
    hours after the event opened on its first day and I made a beeline to
              my favorite vendors, the Vintage Linen People.**

   I immediately gave them all my money (holds up hands and says “I have
     this many”) and then got to work selecting the items which would
    ultimately return home with me to join their friends who were eagerly
                awaiting them in my vintage linen hoard/stash
             /collection/whatever-we’re-calling-it-these-days.

   [LINENS+WM.jpg]

    I was recognized right away by one of the Vintage Linen People thanks
     to my repeat performances on the exact same spot in 2011 and 2012.
   Three years later they still remember me because of my previous summit
                  attempts on their vintage linen mountain.

   [more+barkcloth+WM.jpg]

                            Vintage barkcloth 1.o

   Once completed, this transaction resulted in a drop-off trip to the car
     because it’s physically impossible to navigate the aisles of Farm
    Chicks while carrying a garbage bag stuffed with vintage tablecloths,
                  barkcloth and doilies. Trust me on this.

    (I secretly suspect those shoppers pushing baby strollers through the
   Farm Chicks venue don’t have human babies tucked away in there.  I now
   believe their strollers were filled with toddler-shaped gobs of vintage
     tablecloths in an effort to avoid multiple trips out to their cars.
                                   Smart.

      Note to self:  Begin bookmarking folding baby strollers on eBay.)

     Occasionally I would cross paths with my friend Ethel and her rock
       star, vintage-toting mom, signaling acknowledgement with just a
     friendly wave and a nod because Ethel was in her ZONE, a ZONE which
      prefers to skip over non-essential chitchat while there is still
                     vintage goodness to be discovered.

           That’s why dinnertime was invented. For the chitchat.

                             And I get that.***

                         Wrinkled. So very wrinkled.

   The second day of Farm Chicks was very similar to the first day for me.
    I spent some time with the Vintage Linen People (they had replenished
     AND FOLDED (!) their inventory) and then I moved on to some general
   junk browsing since the crowds were lighter this morning (that changes
                      quickly as the morning goes on).

    This day I was actually able to see more of what was for sale rather
   than who was in front of, behind and all around me, buying it before I
                               could reach it.

   [SOLD+SIGNS+WM.jpg]

       I exercised great restraint and these signs were my only other
                    purchases and I plan to resell them.

        As if I need one more thing. Or one more vintage tablecloth.

                           Except maybe for these.

   [tablecloths+wm.jpg]

    The drive home included one small unscheduled detour because someone
    was talking while her smartphone GPS was waving its arms in the air,
          pointing and shouting to let us know TAKE THIS EXIT. NOW.

                                   Whoops.

     I made it home eventually, happy with my very own mini mountain of
                               vintage linens.

                    ------------------------------------

                              *See what I mean?

   **Vintage Linen People, if you have a formal business name, I apologize
    for not knowing what it is and for bestowing you with such a McBasic
   (yet apt) descriptor. Maybe hang a sign or something? Or not. Whatever.
                                 I love you.

   ***One of these days I’ll write a post about THE SECRET TEST**** Ethel
            gave me the first time I ever went junking with her.

                        ****I passed. (spoiler alert)
