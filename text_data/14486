Apache Turbine™ Web Application Framework

   Apache Turbine™ is a servlet based framework that allows experienced
   Java developers to quickly build web applications. Turbine allows you
   to use personalize the web sites and to use user logins to restrict
   access to parts of your application.

   Turbine is a matured and well established framework that is used as the
   base of many other projects (like e.g. the excellent Jetspeed 1 Portals
   framework.

   Turbine is an excellent choice for developing applications that make
   use of a services-oriented architecture. Some of the functionality
   provided with Turbine includes a security management system (decoupled
   in Fulcrum Security), a scheduling service (decoupled in Fulcrum
   Quartz), XML-defined form validation server (Fulcrum Intake), and an
   XML-RPC service for web services. It is a simple task to create new
   services particular to your application.

   The Turbine core is free of any dependency on a presentation layer
   technology. Both JavaServer Pages (JSP) and Velocity are supported
   inside Turbine. For developers already familiar with JSP, or have
   existing JSP tag libraries, Turbine offers support for the Sun
   standard. Velocity is the favorite view technology of most users of the
   Turbine framework; try it out and see if Velocity can help you develop
   your web applications faster and work more easily with non-programming
   designers.

   Turbine is developed in an open, participatory environment and released
   under the Apache Software License. Turbine is intended to be a
   collaboration of the best-of-breed developers from around the world. We
   invite you to participate in this open development project. To learn
   more about getting involved, look at our "How to Help" pages.

Integration Hints: JS, JSON, REST

   Modelling on the client side with JS-frameworks like KnockoutJS or
   Vue.JS is supported of course. You may use the provided XML-RPC
   service, simple Velocity context or Fulcrum JSON utilities. You may
   even want to skip (almost) the entire (server) view part and decide to
   use just REST-API libraries (Javax.ws.rs, Jersey). As an example
   consider registering an JSON Fulcrum service returning a default
   (Jackson) ObjectMapper object, which may be resolved by a javax.ws.rs
   context Provider. For now no custom security integration is yet
   provided, but this may be done with web-token or any other token based
   authentification system or annotation based.

Turbine Versions

   Turbine is since version 4.0 developed in a single master/branch.
     * Turbine 5.1 is the current development master. Download it from one
       of the Apache Mirrors.
     * Turbine 5.0 is using Servlet 3.1, Java 8, Log4J2, Velocity 2. It is
       already used in some live applications, download it from one of the
       Apache Mirrors.
     * Turbine 4.0 should be used only, if starting a project restricted
       with Java 7. Download it from one of the Apache Mirrors. Turbine
       4.0 uses technologies like an Avalon-based container and decoupled
       components from the Fulcrum sub-project of Turbine (most of the
       benefits of these enhancements are realized in the 2.3.3 release).
       One significant change in 4.0 is the introduction of a pipeline
       concept that allows you to define via XML all the stages for
       processing a request.
     * Turbine 2.3.3 is the version you should use when migrating from an
       older version of Turbine. The 2.3 branch of Turbine has been
       switched to maintenance mode, however. You can download Turbine
       2.3.3 from one of the Apache Mirrors

Sub Projects

     * Fulcrum components are by default in use since Turbine 4.x. It is a
       collection of services originally developed as part of Turbine, but
       now decoupled and usable in any environment that supports Avalon
       components.

Turbine Alumni

   As a longtime, but now ex-member of the Apache Jakarta Project (before
   2018) (old address*), Turbine has influenced quite a number of
   projects:
     * Torque is a persistence layer originally developed as part of
       Turbine. Torque is now decoupled and part of the Apache Database
       Project.
     * Maven is an advanced Java Project Management tool originally
       developed out of the frustration with the Turbine build process.
       Maven is now a toplevel Apache project, residing at
       maven.apache.org.
     * In addition, Turbine has spawned a number of Commons components
       like Commons configuration or Commons EMail.

   * Note: Be aware, that Jakarta EE is since 2019 used as a brand label
   for the Java EE Cloud Native project.

Apache Turbine™ Web Application Framework

   Apache Turbine™ is a servlet based framework that allows experienced
   Java developers to quickly build web applications. Turbine allows you
   to use personalize the web sites and to use user logins to restrict
   access to parts of your application.

   Turbine is a matured and well established framework that is used as the
   base of many other projects (like e.g. the excellent Jetspeed 1 Portals
   framework.

   Turbine is an excellent choice for developing applications that make
   use of a services-oriented architecture. Some of the functionality
   provided with Turbine includes a security management system (decoupled
   in Fulcrum Security), a scheduling service (decoupled in Fulcrum
   Quartz), XML-defined form validation server (Fulcrum Intake), and an
   XML-RPC service for web services. It is a simple task to create new
   services particular to your application.

   The Turbine core is free of any dependency on a presentation layer
   technology. Both JavaServer Pages (JSP) and Velocity are supported
   inside Turbine. For developers already familiar with JSP, or have
   existing JSP tag libraries, Turbine offers support for the Sun
   standard. Velocity is the favorite view technology of most users of the
   Turbine framework; try it out and see if Velocity can help you develop
   your web applications faster and work more easily with non-programming
   designers.

   Turbine is developed in an open, participatory environment and released
   under the Apache Software License. Turbine is intended to be a
   collaboration of the best-of-breed developers from around the world. We
   invite you to participate in this open development project. To learn
   more about getting involved, look at our "How to Help" pages.

Integration Hints: JS, JSON, REST

   Modelling on the client side with JS-frameworks like KnockoutJS or
   Vue.JS is supported of course. You may use the provided XML-RPC
   service, simple Velocity context or Fulcrum JSON utilities. You may
   even want to skip (almost) the entire (server) view part and decide to
   use just REST-API libraries (Javax.ws.rs, Jersey). As an example
   consider registering an JSON Fulcrum service returning a default
   (Jackson) ObjectMapper object, which may be resolved by a javax.ws.rs
   context Provider. For now no custom security integration is yet
   provided, but this may be done with web-token or any other token based
   authentification system or annotation based.

Turbine Versions

   Turbine is since version 4.0 developed in a single master/branch.
     * Turbine 5.1 is the current development master. Download it from one
       of the Apache Mirrors.
     * Turbine 5.0 is using Servlet 3.1, Java 8, Log4J2, Velocity 2. It is
       already used in some live applications, download it from one of the
       Apache Mirrors.
     * Turbine 4.0 should be used only, if starting a project restricted
       with Java 7. Download it from one of the Apache Mirrors. Turbine
       4.0 uses technologies like an Avalon-based container and decoupled
       components from the Fulcrum sub-project of Turbine (most of the
       benefits of these enhancements are realized in the 2.3.3 release).
       One significant change in 4.0 is the introduction of a pipeline
       concept that allows you to define via XML all the stages for
       processing a request.
     * Turbine 2.3.3 is the version you should use when migrating from an
       older version of Turbine. The 2.3 branch of Turbine has been
       switched to maintenance mode, however. You can download Turbine
       2.3.3 from one of the Apache Mirrors

Sub Projects

     * Fulcrum components are by default in use since Turbine 4.x. It is a
       collection of services originally developed as part of Turbine, but
       now decoupled and usable in any environment that supports Avalon
       components.

Turbine Alumni

   As a longtime, but now ex-member of the Apache Jakarta Project (before
   2018) (old address*), Turbine has influenced quite a number of
   projects:
     * Torque is a persistence layer originally developed as part of
       Turbine. Torque is now decoupled and part of the Apache Database
       Project.
     * Maven is an advanced Java Project Management tool originally
       developed out of the frustration with the Turbine build process.
       Maven is now a toplevel Apache project, residing at
       maven.apache.org.
     * In addition, Turbine has spawned a number of Commons components
       like Commons configuration or Commons EMail.

   * Note: Be aware, that Jakarta EE is since 2019 used as a brand label
   for the Java EE Cloud Native project.
