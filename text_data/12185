Pieter de Hooch in Delft, Out From Vermeer’s Shadow

   11 Oct - 16 Feb, Delft

   7 out of 8 visitors find this information valuable.

   Pieter de Hooch was one of the greatest artists from the Golden Age.
   After Johannes Vermeer, he is considered the most famous 17th century
   master from Delft. His world famous paintings in the various museums
   draw huge crowds.

     * Follow the development of Pieter de Hooch.
     * Get a glimpse of 17th century life in Delft.
     * Museum het Prinsenhof was once the residence of William of Orange.

Pieter de Hooch in Delft

   In the period that the art of painting grew and flourished locally,
   Pieter de Hooch benefited from developments in the application of
   perspective and light. Initially, he mainly painted soldier tableaus
   but as he evolved, he was inspired by his surroundings. This resulted
   in a number of beautiful works revolving around Delft. His work offers
   a glimpse of day to day life in Delft homes and inner courtyards. Enjoy
   the views of these paintings and the use of colour, light and
   perspective.

Development

   The exhibition shows how the work of De Hooch evolved. There are a
   number of kortegaerdjes (soldier tableaus) from his early years in
   Delft. You will also see a number of portraits, including his
   self-portrait. This is supplemented with works from his later period in
   Amsterdam and several paintings by his contemporaries. Taken together,
   the work on display offers a special glimpse of De Hooch’s life in
   Delft.

More Golden Age in Delft

   In addition to Vermeer and De Hooch, Delft is primarily known as the
   residence of the Father of the Nation, William of Orange, who lived in
   what today is the Museum Prinsenhof Delft.

   The fascinating past of Delft can still be seen in the historic city
   center. After you stroll through the center, why not visit Royal Delft,
   which is the only Delft Blue pottery factory remaining from the 17th
   century. It still produces the world famous Delft Blue pottery.

Spend the night nearby

   Enjoy a few days in the Haaglanden area and visit both Delft and The
   Hague. Spend the night in or near Delft or opt for an accommodation on
   the coast to enjoy a relaxed weekend!

   Claude Monet, the master of Impressionism, may have painted his best
   works in his own gardens in the French village of Giverny. He created a
   huge flower garden, as well as a landscape garden with a pond. The red
   bridge, the reflection of willow branches and clouds in the water, and
   the waterlilies on the surface of the water inspired Monet to paint
   intense and colorful works. His Waterlilies series is world-famous.
     * As many as 40 international top works by Monet on display together
       in Holland.
     * Enjoy the dreamy painting Wisteria, which is the highlight of the
       exhibition.
     * Explore the interaction of reflections, transparency, and lilies on
       the water.

40 international top paintings

   Monet’s famous ‘gardens’ have never been brought together in Holland in
   this way before. The last big Monet exhibitions were held in 1986 at
   the Van Gogh Museum and 1952 at the Kunstmuseum. His ‘gardens’ had a
   major impact on other artists, including Mark Rothko and Jackson
   Pollock. Monet - The Garden Paintings will feature as many as forty
   international top paintings. Wisteria from the Kunstmuseum’s own
   collection will be the star of the exhibition.

Wisteria’s surprising restoration

   While preparing for the exhibition in The Hague, the conservator
   encountered a big surprise. Underneath the current image is another
   painting featuring waterlilies! Wisteria was already an extraordinary
   painting since there are only seven known Monet paintings with this
   theme. It is even more special knowing that there are waterlilies
   underneath the painting.

Practical information

   Online tickets for the exhibition are available starting 1 October
   2019.
