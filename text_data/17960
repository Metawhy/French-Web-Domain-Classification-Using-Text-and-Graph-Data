   The purpose of the International Conference on Bioinformatics Models,
   Methods and Algorithms is to bring together researchers and
   practitioners interested in the design and application of modelling
   frameworks, algorithmic concepts, computational methods, and
   information technologies to address challenging problems in
   Bioinformatics and Biomedical research.
   There is a tremendous need to explore how mathematical, statistical and
   computational techniques can be used to better understand biological
   processes and systems, while developing new methodologies and tools to
   analyze the massive currently-available biological data. Areas of
   interest to this community include systems biology and biological
   networks (regulatory, neuronal, predator-prey, ecological ones, etc.),
   sequence analysis, biostatistics,  graph models, image analysis,
   scientific data management and data mining, machine learning, pattern
   recognition, computational evolutionary biology, computational genomics
   and proteomics, and related areas.
