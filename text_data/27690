   VOZZ RS 1.0 Helmet

Directional Visor Stability (DVS)

   DVS or Directional Visor Stability is achieved by providing a 3-point
   locking system once the helmet is in a closed position. Once the helmet
   is secured to the head and the chin cup is fully adjusted to the user's
   jaw length, the helmets visor port remains in a static position and
   cannot shift whilst riding at high speeds due to the close fit. The
   aerodynamic lower edge guards against buffeting and also prevents wind
   entering under the lower edge and lifting the helmet in an upward
   motion.

Production Quality

   All Vozz Helmets are manufactured under strict protocols to ensure the
   quality meets the technology. Vozz has partnered with an International
   Composite Helmet Manufacturer who is an ISO9001 certified manufacturer.
   Vozz helmets are subject to strict QA guidelines prior to completion
   ensuring the best possible quality available in a composite helmet
   globally.

Safety Release System

   Unique to VOZZ Helmets, the SRS enables paramedics and first responders
   to gain instant access to the patient without putting stress and
   pressure on the neck and spine buy “pulling” the helmet off. Instead,
   with a click the VOZZ SRS exposes the rider’s face without moving the
   head or neck. In addition, paramedics can completely remove the main
   helmet by releasing the SRS.

Sizing and Fitting

   Vozz has developed multiple shell sizes and also EPS liners to ensure
   the best possible fit to the end user. With a combination of 3 shell
   sizes and 3 EPS liners and multiple comfort liners the fit will be
   second to none. Now you will have a helmet that actually fits your head
   size rather than different thickness of comfort padding being used to
   ensure a correct fit.

Inside a Vozz Helmet

   Inside a Vozz helmet you will find a world of difference from the
   conventional pull on, pull off, full-face helmets. The first difference
   you will notice is the fit, the Vozz helmet fits like a glove, as you
   slide your face into the opening and secure by way of a fully
   adjustable chin cup, which is a “Set and Forget Retention System”. Once
   the helmet is closed and secured to the head the fit is ultra
   comfortable with no chinstrap required to fasten the helmet to the
   head. You will also find a multi density EPS liner, with ultra
   low-density areas to improve impact results. Additional benefits
   include no ear folding due to sliding into the helmet rather than
   pulling down on your head.
