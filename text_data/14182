Solo Piano III

   Solo Piano III completes the Solo Piano trilogy. Like any final act,
   there are complications and consequences, followed by an urgent race to
   the finish line. Like its predecessors, it’s a mostly happy ending in C
   major, but there is more dissonance, tension and ambiguity along the
   way. The musical purity of Solo Piano III is not an antidote for our
   times, it is a reflection of all the beauty and ugliness around us.

Solo Piano II

   In December 2011, Chilly Gonzales moved his piano into Paris Studio
   Pigalle.
   There, alone for 10 days, he recorded a handful of songs that had made
   the short list from a hundred or so melodies written over the eight
   years that had passed since the release of the now iconic Solo Piano.
   Hour upon hour, the purest and most microscopic process of recording
   took place. Chilly Gonzales played all the songs over and over and over
   again, until each one’s essence had been captured. After years of
   entertaining with his larger than life musical persona and challenging
   all artists to work tirelessly to achieve excellence out of respect for
   their fans, Chilly Gonzales brings us perhaps his most powerful
   argument of all, the 14 pieces of Solo Piano II.

    1. White Keys
    2. Kenaston
    3. Minor Fantasy
    4. Escher

   Phillip Glass among others, this record is Chilly Gonzales’
   ‘professional confessional’, revealing more of himself on these
   monologues than ever before.

Guinness World Record The Works

   Beginning at 23:30 on Saturday May 16th and through 3:00 Monday May
   18th, 2009 Chilly Gonzales broke the Guiness World Record for longest
   concert by a solo artist. The previous record was 26 hours and 12
   minutes and was performed by Prasanna Gudi (India) at the Mallikarjun
   Mansoor Kala Bhavan public auditorium, Dharwad, Karnataka, India from
   28 to 29 December 2008. Gonzales explained his motivation: “I will do
   this to push my muscial and physical stamina. I believe music is part
   art, part athletics and this 27-hour concert will demonstrate both
   aspects.” Gonzales had been consulting with the Guiness Book of Record
   to ensure a smooth attempt and an Official Guinness Judge adjudicated
   the event on site. Repertoire touched on recognizable songs from all
   eras and styles of music, in new and surprising arrangements. There was
   no repetition of material during the attempt. As Gonzales himself said
   “I will break the record without sounding like a broken record”. The
   record attempt took place at the theatre of notable French film
   director Claude Lelouch, Theatre Ciné 13 in Paris. The attempt in its
   entirety was streamed live on the web and achieved #2 Twitter Trend
   status at its peak.

Presidential Suite

   “The great Gonzo’s first pop album, a record of such sparkling joy that
   it makes that S Club Juniors single look like one of Thom Yorke’s
   suicide poems. Gonzo fans will be aware of his repertoire since
   European electro whimsy, piano, and balladry were all stirred and
   twisted on his full length debut « Über Alles », while digital
   hardcore, hip-hop, mop-styled craziness and snoop-derived rhyme
   patterns were all fucked up on the classic follow up ‘The
   Entertainist’. And here, as was hoped, the two meet”.

The Entertainist

   He looks like Jon Spencer but sounds more like Eminem, with a lo-fi 808
   nightmare pushing Dr. Dre out of the producer’s chair. Still, Gonzales
   is definitely not the worst MC, as he styles himself on a track heard
   on his first pure rap LP, The Entertainist. He’s actually a great
   rapper, as iconoclastic and inscrutable a figure as Kool Keith or Ol’
   Dirty Bastard, with an irresistible sense of rhythm, hilarious lyrics,
   and a raw, kinetic production approach that benefits on several
   skeletal tracks from Digital Hardcore colleagues Patric Catani and
   Bomb20. One of the best productions, though, was actually recorded by
   Gonzales’ associate Peaches. The track, “Futuristic Ain’t Shit to Me,”
   appears to set out the Chilly Gonzales agenda (“Being futuristic these
   days means being futuristic on your own terms”), though subsequent
   lyrics (“Being futuristic means loving worms/Saving your sperm/Wearing
   your pubes in a perm”) resist any attempt at analysis. Besides rapping
   white-boy nonsense like Beck or MC Paul Barman (“Jimmy Carter in the
   place to be!/Hangin’ with Chilly G!”), Gonzales also pokes fun at the
   legion of sex-crazed rappers out there, with amusing parodies (we’re
   assuming) like “Candy” and “Cum on You.” It’s unclear whether he’s
   attempting to save rap from the mainstream blahs or ridicule it out of
   existence, but The Entertainist is a brilliant left-field hit for fans
   of oddball hip-hop production and zany lyrics. allmusicguide.com

   horns, hypnotizing bells and influenced by Prokofiev, Morricone and
   Phillip Glass among others, this record is Chilly Gonzales’
   ‘professional confessional’, revealing more of himself on these
   monologues than ever before.

Guinness World Record The Works

   Beginning at 23:30 on Saturday May 16th and through 3:00 Monday May
   18th, 2009 Chilly Gonzales broke the Guiness World Record for longest
   concert by a solo artist. The previous record was 26 hours and 12
   minutes and was performed by Prasanna Gudi (India) at the Mallikarjun
   Mansoor Kala Bhavan public auditorium, Dharwad, Karnataka, India from
   28 to 29 December 2008. Gonzales explained his motivation: “I will do
   this to push my muscial and physical stamina. I believe music is part
   art, part athletics and this 27-hour concert will demonstrate both
   aspects.” Gonzales had been consulting with the Guiness Book of Record
   to ensure a smooth attempt and an Official Guinness Judge adjudicated
   the event on site. Repertoire touched on recognizable songs from all
   eras and styles of music, in new and surprising arrangements. There was
   no repetition of material during the attempt. As Gonzales himself said
   “I will break the record without sounding like a broken record”. The
   record attempt took place at the theatre of notable French film
   director Claude Lelouch, Theatre Ciné 13 in Paris. The attempt in its
   entirety was streamed live on the web and achieved #2 Twitter Trend
   status at its peak.

Presidential Suite

   “The great Gonzo’s first pop album, a record of such sparkling joy that
   it makes that S Club Juniors single look like one of Thom Yorke’s
   suicide poems. Gonzo fans will be aware of his repertoire since
   European electro whimsy, piano, and balladry were all stirred and
   twisted on his full length debut « Über Alles », while digital
   hardcore, hip-hop, mop-styled craziness and snoop-derived rhyme
   patterns were all fucked up on the classic follow up ‘The
   Entertainist’. And here, as was hoped, the two meet”.

The Entertainist

   He looks like Jon Spencer but sounds more like Eminem, with a lo-fi 808
   nightmare pushing Dr. Dre out of the producer’s chair. Still, Gonzales
   is definitely not the worst MC, as he styles himself on a track heard
   on his first pure rap LP, The Entertainist. He’s actually a great
   rapper, as iconoclastic and inscrutable a figure as Kool Keith or Ol’
   Dirty Bastard, with an irresistible sense of rhythm, hilarious lyrics,
   and a raw, kinetic production approach that benefits on several
   skeletal tracks from Digital Hardcore colleagues Patric Catani and
   Bomb20. One of the best productions, though, was actually recorded by
   Gonzales’ associate Peaches. The track, “Futuristic Ain’t Shit to Me,”
   appears to set out the Chilly Gonzales agenda (“Being futuristic these
   days means being futuristic on your own terms”), though subsequent
   lyrics (“Being futuristic means loving worms/Saving your sperm/Wearing
   your pubes in a perm”) resist any attempt at analysis. Besides rapping
   white-boy nonsense like Beck or MC Paul Barman (“Jimmy Carter in the
   place to be!/Hangin’ with Chilly G!”), Gonzales also pokes fun at the
   legion of sex-crazed rappers out there, with amusing parodies (we’re
   assuming) like “Candy” and “Cum on You.” It’s unclear whether he’s
   attempting to save rap from the mainstream blahs or ridicule it out of
   existence, but The Entertainist is a brilliant left-field hit for fans
   of oddball hip-hop production and zany lyrics. allmusicguide.com

Solo Piano III

   Solo Piano III completes the Solo Piano trilogy. Like any final act,
   there are complications and consequences, followed by an urgent race to
   the finish line. Like its predecessors, it’s a mostly happy ending in C
   major, but there is more dissonance, tension and ambiguity along the
   way. The musical purity of Solo Piano III is not an antidote for our
   times, it is a reflection of all the beauty and ugliness around us.

Solo Piano II

   In December 2011, Chilly Gonzales moved his piano into Paris Studio
   Pigalle.
   There, alone for 10 days, he recorded a handful of songs that had made
   the short list from a hundred or so melodies written over the eight
   years that had passed since the release of the now iconic Solo Piano.
   Hour upon hour, the purest and most microscopic process of recording
   took place. Chilly Gonzales played all the songs over and over and over
   again, until each one’s essence had been captured. After years of
   entertaining with his larger than life musical persona and challenging
   all artists to work tirelessly to achieve excellence out of respect for
   their fans, Chilly Gonzales brings us perhaps his most powerful
   argument of all, the 14 pieces of Solo Piano II.

    1. White Keys
    2. Kenaston
    3. Minor Fantasy
    4. Escher
    5. Rideaux Lunaires
    6. Neros Nocturne

    8. Evolving Doors
    9. Epigram in E

   concert by a solo artist. The previous record was 26 hours and 12
   minutes and was performed by Prasanna Gudi (India) at the Mallikarjun
   Mansoor Kala Bhavan public auditorium, Dharwad, Karnataka, India from
   28 to 29 December 2008. Gonzales explained his motivation: “I will do
   this to push my muscial and physical stamina. I believe music is part
   art, part athletics and this 27-hour concert will demonstrate both
   aspects.” Gonzales had been consulting with the Guiness Book of Record
   to ensure a smooth attempt and an Official Guinness Judge adjudicated
   the event on site. Repertoire touched on recognizable songs from all
   eras and styles of music, in new and surprising arrangements. There was
   no repetition of material during the attempt. As Gonzales himself said
   “I will break the record without sounding like a broken record”. The
   record attempt took place at the theatre of notable French film
   director Claude Lelouch, Theatre Ciné 13 in Paris. The attempt in its
   entirety was streamed live on the web and achieved #2 Twitter Trend
   status at its peak.

The Entertainist

   He looks like Jon Spencer but sounds more like Eminem, with a lo-fi 808
   nightmare pushing Dr. Dre out of the producer’s chair. Still, Gonzales
   is definitely not the worst MC, as he styles himself on a track heard
   on his first pure rap LP, The Entertainist. He’s actually a great
   rapper, as iconoclastic and inscrutable a figure as Kool Keith or Ol’
   Dirty Bastard, with an irresistible sense of rhythm, hilarious lyrics,
   and a raw, kinetic production approach that benefits on several
   skeletal tracks from Digital Hardcore colleagues Patric Catani and
   Bomb20. One of the best productions, though, was actually recorded by
   Gonzales’ associate Peaches. The track, “Futuristic Ain’t Shit to Me,”
   appears to set out the Chilly Gonzales agenda (“Being futuristic these
   days means being futuristic on your own terms”), though subsequent
   lyrics (“Being futuristic means loving worms/Saving your sperm/Wearing
   your pubes in a perm”) resist any attempt at analysis. Besides rapping
   white-boy nonsense like Beck or MC Paul Barman (“Jimmy Carter in the
   place to be!/Hangin’ with Chilly G!”), Gonzales also pokes fun at the
   legion of sex-crazed rappers out there, with amusing parodies (we’re
   assuming) like “Candy” and “Cum on You.” It’s unclear whether he’s
   attempting to save rap from the mainstream blahs or ridicule it out of
   existence, but The Entertainist is a brilliant left-field hit for fans
   of oddball hip-hop production and zany lyrics. allmusicguide.com

Solo Piano III

   Solo Piano III completes the Solo Piano trilogy. Like any final act,
   there are complications and consequences, followed by an urgent race to
   the finish line. Like its predecessors, it’s a mostly happy ending in C
   major, but there is more dissonance, tension and ambiguity along the
   way. The musical purity of Solo Piano III is not an antidote for our
   times, it is a reflection of all the beauty and ugliness around us.

Solo Piano II

   In December 2011, Chilly Gonzales moved his piano into Paris Studio
   Pigalle.
   There, alone for 10 days, he recorded a handful of songs that had made
   the short list from a hundred or so melodies written over the eight
   years that had passed since the release of the now iconic Solo Piano.
   Hour upon hour, the purest and most microscopic process of recording
   took place. Chilly Gonzales played all the songs over and over and over
   again, until each one’s essence had been captured. After years of
   entertaining with his larger than life musical persona and challenging
   all artists to work tirelessly to achieve excellence out of respect for
   their fans, Chilly Gonzales brings us perhaps his most powerful
   argument of all, the 14 pieces of Solo Piano II.

    1. White Keys
    2. Kenaston
    3. Minor Fantasy
    4. Escher
    5. Rideaux Lunaires
    6. Neros Nocturne
    7. Venetian Blinds
    8. Evolving Doors
    9. Epigram in E
   10. Othello
   11. Train of Thought
   12. Wintermezzo
   13. La Bulle
   14. Papa Gavotte

The Unspeakable Chilly Gonzales

   “The Unspeakable Chilly Gonzales” is the first ever all orchestral rap

   horns, hypnotizing bells and influenced by Prokofiev, Morricone and
   Phillip Glass among others, this record is Chilly Gonzales’
   ‘professional confessional’, revealing more of himself on these
   monologues than ever before.
