Equations of Circles Card Sort

   [IMG_0931.jpg]
   How has your summer been? I feel like mine has been so uneventful....
   which has been lovely because I really wanted to do nothing.... Well I
   mean, I haven't done nothing.... after all... I'm prepping for two new
   preps..... Cornell Notes anyone? Yup! That's what I've been working on!
   Anyways.... this past May, I underwent the interview process for my
   new/current job. As part of the interview process, we were to create a
   demo lesson under the stipulations that we could teach any topic we
   wanted that was part of Geometry or Precalculus and that we'd be
   teaching students ranging from Algebra 1 to Precalculus.
   [IMG_0932%2Bcopy.jpg] Well, I was on vacation in Charleston, South
   Carolina, when I got notification of my demo lesson. Needless to say,
   boyfriend and I had to take some time out of our vacation to create and
   practice this lesson... He was great at acting like a teenager.... (he
   really had no interest in doing math on his only vacation from Law
   School).
   So that got me thinking about what lesson I could create that would set
   me apart from the crowd. I love collaborative activities so I created a
   card sort where students created equations of circles from a variety of
   information provided. I felt like it also helped reinforce the
   students' ability to problem solve.
   Anyways..... feel free to check out the product on TPT now!

iPad App #2 - Quiver Vision

   [quiver-3d-coloring-app-16-9-s-307x512.jpeg]
   Quiver is an app that can bring a coloring page to life! In all
   reality, you parents out there will love this for your kids because all
   you have to do is print out a coloring page for your kid to go to town
   on. Then, you hold the iPad or iPhone over the coloring page and it
   will animate the contents.
   How can this be used in a classroom?
     * Currently, I'm not necessarily seeing the application within a math
       classroom but there is a great coloring page on an animal cell that
       will quiz/assess the child on their ability to identify the parts
       of a cell

   I believe there are other apps out there that deal with Geometric
   shapes.... but I haven't found them yet. As I'm teaching Geometry next
   year, it's my goal to start my hunt!

But really...... I'm back

   Two months ago,
   I posted about my pending return....
   What I failed to mention in that post was another component of my life
   that was making me rather busy....
   A Job Search.
   I am pleased and proud to say that I will have accepted a new job at
   another school in the Columbus area. It has been a dream of mine to be
   a part of this school district so it was worth the entire interview
   process (including a demo lesson - which I will be posting on TPT).
   [th.jpg]
   That being said, I promise to return and post and post and post....
   Because I have two new preps...... Geometry and Precalculus!!!! I am so
   excited for two new courses because this means brand new material! All
   summer long to plan and pin! I also intend to put a lot of my content
   from this past year on TPT which means talking about how the stuff went
   when I actually used them.
   You'll probably notice that I made my first post... it features some of
   the iPad apps that I have discovered/used/intend to use......
   Thank you for your continued support! It has been amazing to read your
   emails and I am so sorry for the delay. In fact, it's always incredible
   when my MOTHER (who is also a teacher) informs me that she met one of
   my blog readers and they're mad at me for not posting.....

iPad App #1 - Aurasma

   [Aurasma__CTA_PAGE_Positive_Col.png]
   What is Aurasma? Aurasma is a augmented reality app that can bring
   everyday objects to life just by holding your iphone/ipad over the
   object using your camera.
   How can this be used in the classroom?
     * Take pictures of textbook examples that you know require additional
       explanations/assistance (in my mind, not all do). When students use
       the app and hold the camera over this explanation, link it to an
       explanation video where you are walking through the example
     * Use the app for projects so students take a picture of their
       project. Then, you can have the kids link this to a video where the
       child is explaining the components of their projects and the
       history/process to their product

     * Personally, I'd love to had the kids design a "cement brick" on one
       of my classroom walls showcasing an artistic representation of one
       of the topics covered in the class. Then, they could take a picture
       of the brick linking to a resource about the topic. I'd use this as
       an end of course project

   Currently, I just found it to be fun to hover the app over the back of
   a twenty dollar bill.... try it out!!!
   I haven't personally used the app yet but I feel like the possibilities
   are endless!

My oh My Miss Rudolph..... where have you been???

   [61249060.jpg]
   For shame, for shame..... Wow year 3 has been so busy. Between RESA
   tasks for ODE and new PD opportunities, Miss Rudolph has been a busy
   woman! But I promise, I will return....
   But what have you been doing? What lessons have you been creating? What
   new material will you bring us??
   Well....
     * Flipped Classroom (I'm currently halfway through a full blown
       implementation and I cannot wait to share what I have learned and
       what I am still learning - as well as the resources and materials
       that I have been using)
     * Video Review Project (Last week's method of review.... I'm pretty
       pleased with the results so I can't wait to discuss and reflect on
       this)
     * Instructional Tool / Resource Project (The initial student created
       products are due next week with a full product due in May - aka my
       design challenge)
     * New PD Opportunity & what I have learned (iPad.... whaaaat?)
     * Desmos Match the Graph Projects

   But sigh, they will all have to wait.... Thank you those of you who
   have sent me such kind words via email. I have them all saved and I do
   intend to respond.... but between RESA / PD / School, I've been a tad
   bit busy..... oh did I mention that I'm piloting a new course this term
   and I piloted another new course during the month of January? yeah, my
   apologies :(

Algebra 1 INB - Rational Expressions

   Oh my goodness, I know it has been an extremely long time and so much
   has happened!
   THIS JUST IN (well about a month ago)...... MISS RUDOLPH IS TEACHING
   ALGEBRA 1! PANIC MODE SET IN.
   Okay, so as soon as I found this out, I had my little panic of not
   being prepared but then I got myself into gear and recalled all the
   wonderful resources out there.
   In fact, I decided to do an INB with my kiddos and so far, so good.
   One topic that had not been addressed in the resources that I found was
   the idea of rational expressions. Now, we're introducing the topic to
   our kids and revisiting it later. For now, our kids are just using GCF
   to help reduce. No factoring trinomials (we learn that later).
   So for those notes, here's what I did.....
   [IMG_5065.JPG]
   I then had to figure out how to do some examples..... I started writing
   them out then realized, it'd be easier to keep with the pace and
   provide a piece of paper for the kids to glue..... so I did!
   [IMG_5066.JPG]
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-09%2Bat%2B7.11.20%2BAM.png]
   I'll upload the doc later... I really just needed to post because (1) I
   felt bad and (2) I need the digital files of the notes for the kids and
   (3) I wanted to share the news about Algebra 1.
   Okay! I'll be back soon... I promise....
   TOLD YOU I'D BE BACK!!!! Here's the file!

New TPT Product Available! - My Passwords

   August. How I really don't care for thee..... It means it's time to
   start hard core prep. Well, something that I am determined (gung ho if
   you will) to do is to place an emphasis on organization with my
   homeroom (advisory). One aspect of organization is the idea that kids
   need to keep their passwords organized. Because lord knows, your
   computer doesn't always have your passwords saved..... They are always
   surprised when this happens ;)
   So, I've made a simply darling password saver (handout) and it's now
   available on TPT!

About Me

   My photo

   Miss Rudolph
          Columbus, OH
          I'm a third year high school math teacher attempting to navigate
          my way to being a successful. As many say, I belong in a
          kindergarten classroom... probably why I love all the elementary
          blogs I've found. However, I've noticed that the blogging world
          has failed me with secondary education blogs. So, I've taken it
          upon myself to develop a blog for those secondary education
          teachers who like to be as organized and creative as our
          elementary counterparts.
