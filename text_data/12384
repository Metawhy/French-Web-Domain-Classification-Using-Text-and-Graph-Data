Ask yourself…how ethical is my wardrobe?

   New terms like sustainable fashion and ethical wear-ability are
   spreading like wildfire both on the runway and on the streets. From NY
   to Tokyo young and old are starting to use umbrella terms like ethical
   fashion and slow fashion. Similar to the slow-movement, slow fashion
   advocates environmental control, and fair labor practices.

   New values placed on upgrading standards of ethical labor, fair trade
   and the environment are changing both manufacturing practices and
   design. And that is just the tip of the iceberg. The time has come to
   research where that new sweater of yours was made, how it was
   transported to this country as well as how eco-friendly the material
   is.

Ask yourself…how ethical is my wardrobe?

   New terms like sustainable fashion and ethical wear-ability are
   spreading like wildfire both on the runway and on the streets. From NY
   to Tokyo young and old are starting to use umbrella terms like ethical
   fashion and slow fashion. Similar to the slow-movement, slow fashion
   advocates environmental control, and fair labor practices.

   New values placed on upgrading standards of ethical labor, fair trade
   and the environment are changing both manufacturing practices and
   design. And that is just the tip of the iceberg. The time has come to
   research where that new sweater of yours was made, how it was
   transported to this country as well as how eco-friendly the material
   is.

   Healing crystal jewelry offers a form of protection and a way to
   celebrate the body through healing crystals. For hundreds of years, it
   has played a vital role in connecting the human spirit and body and
   healing the mind, being, and soul. Ancient Indians used the stones to
   transform the wearer into a figure of beauty while reaching perfection
   internally and externally. Healing crystal jewelry still serves to
   bring beauty and attention to those who wear it, however in more recent
   years, it has been discovered that the crystals bear healing qualities
   that facilitate easier living. Specifically, healing crystal jewelry
   helps one to find his/herself, something difficult to achieve without
   assistance. Similarly, the treasures positively influence important
   decisions, protect against negativity, and generate good luck and
   fortune. The energies emitted from crystals can help improve your
   moods, your health and even your mental and spiritual wellbeing.
