How do we get the best free samples?

   My name is John 'Samples' Clark and I am the main writer for this
   website. I spend a couple hours each day researching the best free
   samples and the requirements to get each free sample. Do you need to
   enter your email address or not? What about signing up for a club
   membership? I break that down for every free sample posted here. Here
   are all the websites I actually use to research the free samples
   without surveys that will hopefully be mailed to your home very soon.

   Have a blessed day,
