:: Minimalist Coastal Bedroom Decor ::

   Posted on August 7, 2019 by {tuvalu}

What’s Trending Wednesday

   Coastal bedroom with a minimal design style There’s something
   refreshing about a clean and minimal coastal bedroom. It’s inviting in
   a way that says, “Don’t worry about a thing, enjoy yourself and relax.”

   Our bedrooms should always be about relaxation and comfort which
   minimal design definitely offers. The clean lines in the space aren’t
   cluttered with unnecessary design elements which leaves your line of
   sight and mind stress free and mess free.

   The best part about minimal design has to be the options. It doesn’t
   mean that everything has to be white or have a minimalistic design.
   That is, of course, one way of doing it, but not the only one. You can
   introduce color into the space and even use bold patterns, but use them
   in moderation to keep the clean and simple look. Check out some of
   these beautiful clean and simple bedrooms we’re loving! Coastal bedroom
   with a minimal rustic style Coastal bedroom with natural light and
   natural jute and wood accessories and furniture Minimal coastal bedroom

:: Using Color In The Kitchen ::

What’s Trending Wednesday

   Bright, coastal kitchen with jade dishes and accessories It’s time to
   brighten up that kitchen! One way to bring more color into the kitchen
   is with your dish ware! Dish ware is an easy way to spice up the
   kitchen and bring some new, fresh color to it.

   You can use dish ware and other kitchen accessories to compliment or
   contrast the kitchen’s color palette. It’s a fun, simple and easy way
   to bring more color into the kitchen. Don’t forget about other
   accessories such as jars and bottles. And when you feel like designing
   with different colors you can just switch them out! It’s as easy as
   that!

   Take a look at these kitchens and see what designers have done in them.
   See how they used dinnerware and other kitchen accessories to put the
   final touches on the space.

:: Coastal Staircase Decoration ::

   Posted on July 31, 2019 by {tuvalu}
   Standard

What’s Trending Wednesday

   coastal living coastal staircase home built in storage stairs The
   staircase, like the bathroom, can often be overlooked and forgotten.
   Don’t waste that space! It can be a tricky space because it’s not the
   easiest to decorate. You mostly have walls, maybe a small shelf space
   of sorts and a little floor space at the bottom to work with, but
   that’s okay!

   We have found that a lot can be done in small spaces! There’s no need
   to limit yourself. Plus we can’t forget about the stairs themselves. We
   can use stair runners, wood or even tiles to decorate them giving us
   even more options.

   Check out some of these staircases to find out what other
   people/designers are doing and to get some inspiration! Apply what you
   like to your home. Put up that gallery wall and use that space! Modern

:: Texture Details With Woven Pieces ::

   Posted on July 24, 2019 by {tuvalu}
   Standard

What’s Trending Wednesday

   Coastal kitchen and dining area with woven chairs, white pendant lamp
   and striped rug It’s time to get your weave on! Woven furniture and
   accessories are a great way to bring some coastal cottage feels to any
   space. They’re light on the eyes because they don’t have a bulky or
   solid look. We associate the look of rattan with a laid back, cottage
   feel that has the opposite effect of hard lines.

   Woven pieces also bring a nice bit of texture to the space. This adds
   more visual depth while not having to add extra decor. Another big plus
   about woven pieces is that they also come in every shape and size. You
   can get almost anything from a woven rattan chair to the classic woven
   jute basket. You can go wild with woven pieces! Not recommended though,
   you don’t need an entire house filled with woven furniture and
   accessories. Think of them as accent pieces.

   Check out what these designers have done with woven pieces in their
   space! Get inspired and then get your woven goods!
