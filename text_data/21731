 TONCHIN Philosophy

Dekitate for you.

   (Made, for you)

   To this day we still aim to give our customers the best ramen with the
   freshest ingredients. We make our broth every day from scratch, using
   the best quality pork stock.  Our noodles, chashu (pork belly) and
   nitamago (sliced egg) are also made daily to ensure maximum freshness.
   Our belief is that “homemade” and “Just Made” Ramen is the best
   ramen. Our mission is to strive for perfection and to spread that
   philosophy throughout the world.

   Our ramen is made just for you (Dekitate)

Tonchin is a gathering place.

   Creating a place for everyone to eat well and connect with love.

   —neighbors, friends, family—


TOKYO TONKOTSU RAMEN

   Tonchin made a culture of Tokyo Tonkotsu ramen and it became one of the
   most famous ramen restaurants in Tokyo. Tokyo Tonkotsu brought a new
   ramen making method focused on fresh homemade ramen noodles which did
   not exist before. The soup has a rich flavor which drew from pork,
   chicken, and vegetables and it cooks with soy sauce slowly. Our
   homemade noodles are medium-thick and curly, made by kneading our
   original fish dash into our house blended flour. We stick to make all
   homemade noodles, soup, and toppings. It is finished with an exquisite
   balance that the taste of the noodles begins to melt in the soup
   creating a great taste. The Tonkotsu Ramen, which was born in Tokyo, is
   Tokyo Tonkotsu Ramen.

OUR STORY

   Tonchin was founded in 1992, by Katsuhiro Sugeno, and his brother,
   Motohiro Sugeno. Tonchin, the name was given in the hope of the place
   where many people get together and enjoy delicious food.

   After 25 years since the first opening, Tonchin started to operate in
   the U.S. This is Tonchin New York. Anan Sugeno, the son of Katsuhiro
   Sugeno wanted to bring the philosophy of Tonchin to the world, he made
   a team with some New Yorkers and this Tonchin New York project has been
   started. With the freshness, "Dekitate",  or just made it for you, and
   the same quality of the taste, the project team discussed how to make
   Tonchin where many people get together.

   Tokyo meets NY, with love. The concept of Tonchin New York is "Tokyo
   meets NY, with love." Ramen is a part of life in Tokyo and bar or
   cocktail is also a part of life in New York. The best Ramen and the
   best cocktail met in Tonchin New York. That is our tempting offer.
