EWG’s Sunscreen Guide:

EWG’s 13th Annual Guide to Sunscreens

   Better products coming but most still offer inferior protection or use
   concerning ingredients

   [EWG_Sunscreen-2019_Infographic-1_C02.jpg]
   [EWG_Sunscreen-2019_MobileInfographic-1_C02.jpg]

   Since 2007, EWG’s annual Guide to Sunscreens has exposed how many
   sunscreen products sold in the U.S. fall short of effectively and
   safely protecting people, and has advised consumers on safer and more
   effective choices. At the same time, we’ve pushed the Food and Drug
   Administration to update and improve sunscreen regulations, urging the
   agency to set stricter standards to better protect public health.

   The good news: The FDA is finally proposing big changes that address
   many of our concerns, and should make all sunscreens safer and more
   effective.

   But wait: Those changes will not be in sunscreens on the shelves this
   year. For this year’s Guide, we assessed more than 1,300 products with
   SPF, including 750 currently available beach and sport sunscreens, and
   found that about two-thirds still offer inferior sun protection or
   contain concerning ingredients, such as oxybenzone, a potentially
   hormone-disrupting chemical that is readily absorbed by the body.

   The FDA first began the process of updating sunscreen regulations more
   than 40 years ago. In February, the agency at long last issued a
   proposed set of final rules. As written, the new rules would bring
   significant advances in both effectiveness and safety. But many big
   chemical manufacturers and sunscreen companies are lobbying heavily for
   a much weaker proposal that  would likely leave the state of sunscreens
   in the U.S. largely unchanged.

   Here are some of the most important changes proposed by the FDA, and
   how they relate to our advice in this year’s and previous years’
   Guides.

   [EWG_Sunscreen-2019_Infographic-3_C03.jpg]
   [EWG_Sunscreen-2019_MobileInfographic-3_C03.jpg]

Safe and effective ingredients

   For decades, Americans have been told that sunscreen use is critical to
   prevent lasting skin damage and skin cancer from sun exposure. But the
   FDA has not ensured that the ingredients meant to provide such
   protection have been adequately tested for safety and efficacy.

   Now the FDA is for the first time proposing that active ingredients in
   sunscreen be sufficiently tested to determine the rate of absorption
   through the skin and the health impacts that may result from exposure
   to those ingredients. Based on existing test data, the agency’s
   proposal recognizes as safe and effective just two ingredients, zinc
   oxide and titanium dioxide. From the beginning, EWG’s Guide has
   recommended that consumers choose sunscreen products made with zinc
   oxide and titanium dioxide, which meet our standards for effectiveness
   and safety.

   The FDA proposes that 12 other active ingredients commonly found in
   sunscreens, including oxybenzone, need additional data from safety and
   efficacy testing.[1] Those ingredients are used in more than 50 percent
   of the sunscreens EWG assessed for this year’s Guide.

   The test data the FDA is requesting on these existing ingredients are
   the same as those required by the agency for ingredients used elsewhere
   in the world that companies want to introduce in U.S. sunscreens. But
   the FDA will likely give companies additional time to conduct the tests
   and submit the data, and until then, those ingredients can remain in
   sunscreens sold in the U.S.

   The FDA’s proposal also recognizes two active ingredients, PABA and
   trolamine salicylate, as unsafe based on the available scientific
   literature. These ingredients are rarely, if ever, used in sunscreen
   anymore.

   [EWG_Sunscreen-2019_Infographic-2_C01.jpg]
   [EWG_Sunscreen-2019_MobileInfographic-2_C01.jpg]

   Particular concern about oxybenzone – especially for kids

   Oxybenzone is one of the most commonly used sunscreen active
   ingredients, found in more than 60 percent of the non-mineral
   sunscreens in this year’s Guide. In 2008, EWG called on the FDA to
   investigate the safety of oxybenzone use in sunscreen, because of
   mounting evidence that the chemical readily penetrates the skin and
   could potentially disrupt the human hormone system.

   The FDA’s proposal confirms our position, saying that although
   oxybenzone is one of the more thoroughly tested sunscreen ingredients,
   additional data is needed because existing tests raise health concerns.
   Of particular concern to the FDA were test results showing:
     * Oxybenzone is allergenic.
     * It is absorbed through the skin in large amounts.
     * It has been detected in human breast milk, amniotic fluid, urine
       and blood.
     * It is a potential endocrine disruptor.
     * Children may be more vulnerable to harm from oxybenzone than adults
       “because of the potential for higher absorption and
       bioaccumulation.”

   The agency is requesting studies of oxybenzone that measure skin
   absorption and potential impacts on the hormone levels, reproduction
   and development.

   [EWG_Sunscreen-2019_Infographic-4_C02.jpg]
   [EWG_Sunscreen-2019_MobileInfographic-4_C02.jpg]

FDA wants to ban the highest SPF claims, limiting SPF values to 60+

   According to the FDA, higher sun protection factor values, or SPF, have
   not been shown to provide additional clinical benefit and may provide
   users with a false sense of security. To guard against this
   misconception, the agency proposes limiting products’ SPF claims to
   60+.[2]

   The FDA is concerned that claims of excessively high SPF values give
   users a false sense of protection, leading to overexposure to UVA rays
   that increase the risk of long-term skin damage and cancer. The FDA
   emphasized that the SPF cap, along with proposed changes to the broad
   spectrum test, are needed to ensure that sunscreens provide more UVA
   protection.

   This is not the first time the FDA has raised concerns about high SPF
   products. In 2011, an earlier draft of the proposed rules recommended a
   SPF cap of 50+. We see the latest proposal, recommending a cap of 60+,
   as a step backwards. To justify this change, the FDA cites only studies
   of sunscreens with active ingredients that are not allowed for use in
   the U.S. Therefore, it remains unclear whether this change will be
   feasible or beneficial to the U.S. market.

   More than 10 percent of the sunscreens in this year’s Guide claim an
   SPF of greater than 50+. EWG recommends that consumers avoid products
   that claim an SPF higher than 50+.

   [EWG_Sunscreen-2019_Infographic-5_C01.jpg]
   [EWG_Sunscreen-2019_MobileInfographic-5_C01.jpg]

FDA proposes to raise the standard for UVA protection

   The FDA proposal recommends changes to the method companies must use to
   evaluate sunscreens’ broad-spectrum UVA protection. The agency proposes
   a test it initially put forward, in 2007, to ensure that UVA protection
   increase with UVB protection. At the time, sunscreen manufacturers
   fought this change and the agency relented, enabling substandard and
   potentially harmful products to remain on the market for a decade more.
   EWG is supporting this proposed change as an important improvement but
   will advocate that the final standard be even more protective. Our
   modeling predicts that many high SPF products would pass the proposed
   FDA test but still offer inadequate UVA protection.

   When the FDA proposed its current UVA standard, in 2011, we estimated
   that 80 percent of products would pass without any changes to their
   formulations. The European Union sets a higher bar, requiring UVA
   protection to rise in proportion with SPF, and the latest FDA proposal
   would bring U.S.-sold sunscreen closer to that standard.

   [EWG_Sunscreen-2019_Infographic-6_C01.jpg]
   [EWG_Sunscreen-2019_MobileInfographic-6_C01.jpg]

FDA proposes that all spray products undergo additional safety testing

   EWG is concerned that sunscreen sprays pose an inhalation risk and may
   not provide an adequate coating on the skin to ensure proper
   protection. The number of sunscreen sprays on the U.S. market has been
   increasing, and more than a quarter of the sunscreens in this year’s
   Guide are in spray form.

   The FDA proposes that all spray and powdered sunscreens be tested to
   ensure they cannot be inhaled deep into the lungs, where they could do
   irrevocable damage. In pilot testing, the agency found that three of 14
   sprays would not meet its proposed standard but did not say which
   products consumers should avoid. EWG recommends that consumers avoid
   all spray and powder sunscreen products.

   The agency has also proposed numerous other changes to the sunscreen
   regulations that should better protect consumers, including:
     * Banning sunscreens and bug repellent combination products.
     * Improving product labeling.
     * Ensuring that all products with an SPF over 15 provide UVA
       protection.

   The changes proposed by the FDA are focused on effectiveness and the
   safety of active ingredients. They do not address concerns EWG has
   raised about the use of other worrisome ingredients, such as retinyl
   palmitate, a form of vitamin A that may harm sun-exposed skin.

   The FDA is expected to finalize the sunscreens rule before the end of
   the year. Regardless of the new rules, make sun safety a daily habit by
   covering up with clothing, seeking shade, planning around the sun and
   using sunscreen when needed. Enjoy the summer and don't get burned.

   product’s formulation to have a higher SPF value than 60, they can’t
   label it with a higher number.
