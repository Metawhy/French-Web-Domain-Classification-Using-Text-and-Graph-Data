Artificial Intelligence

   BetBuddy’s machine learning models not only drive greater accuracy, but
   are also fully explainable – a unique capability of the solution. A
   research partnership with the Research Centre for Machine Learning at
   City, University of London ensures BetBuddy’s solutions remain
   state-of-the-art.

Personalised Communications at Machine Scale

   Ongoing player interaction is a key requirement from regulators.
   BetBuddy works seamlessly with the IMS Camaign Manager, meaning you can
   deliver highly personalised and focused Responsible Gambling messages
   in real-time via any channel at key trigger points in-game, or via
   email or SMS.

Seamless Integration

   Access BetBuddy’s Responsible Gambling insights seamlessly from
   Playtech’s core IMS player management platform for a
   quick-to-implement, cost-efective ‘out of the box’ Responsible Gambling
   solution for an ever-more stringent regulatory environment.

Omni-channel

   Build segment-specific risk models to support players across retail and
   online play with a consistent approach and methodology, ensuring all
   customers are treated consistently. This is also more efficient in
   terms of solution modelling, development and ongoing support costs.
   [endtoend2.png]

Delivering Proactive Harm Prevention

   BetBuddy is a class-leading Responsible Gambling analytics platform,
   built around data mining and predictive analytics. By combining the
   latest research into problem gambling with the power of machine
   learning, BetBuddy delivers an end-to-end solution for identifying
   and managing at-risk gambling behavioural patterns.

Enhancing Trust in Your Brand is Your Number One Priority

   BetBuddy’s technology gives gambling operators the power to assess
   player risk and identify and minimise harmful play, detecting
   potentially problematic behaviour before it happens. From casino and
   bingo to poker and sports betting, any and every game play session and
   transaction is analysed.

Responsible Gaming

   Armed with the detailed information BetBuddy’s analytical power
   delivers, operators can tailor player communications
   accordingly. Auto-generated messaging can be used to remind players how
   long they have been playing or suggest they take a break, encouraging
   players to assess their own behaviour patterns too. Being able to
   proactively assess and address player risk, and empowering players to
   do the same, is central to developing a healthy, safe gambling
   environment and building and enhancing player trust. BetBuddy can be a
   vital tool in ensuring operators not only meet but exceed the most
   stringent regulatory requirements as they navigate the regulatory
   challenges around Responsible Gambling.

Peer-Reviewed Methodology

   The BetBuddy methodology and models have been independently validated
   by experts in gambling addiction and responsible gambling, and
   published in the leading gambling scientific journals.

End-to-end Solution and Service

   BetBuddy enables operators to automate player risk classification and
   design and implement player interaction strategies accordingly. The
   BetBuddy team can also provide expert responsible gambling support to
   ensure effective operator human oversight of the end-to-end process.

Security

   BetBuddy's solutions are supporting real-time customer facing
   applications in the most heavily regulated industries in the world. Our
   customers, which include some of the worlds largest B2B software
   suppliers and government-run organisations, entrust us with sensitive,
   confidential business data, and we are committed to providing the
   strongest available security for that data. Effective security is
   characterized not only by adherence to certain industry standards, but
   also by implementing multiple levels and types of protection.

BetBuddy is a tech and analytics company, through-and-through

   Every day we tackle big data problems in London's Tech City, one of the
   world's fastest-growing spaces.

Our ethos

   As a team, we value creativity and personal growth, and that comes
   through whether we're on-stage speaking about our work, or rolling out
   a shiny new feature. Interested? We'd love to talk!

Our development culture

Customer focus

   Every decision we make starts with our customers and their needs.  We
   recognise that the most successful companies are customer focussed
   companies.  This means we develop the products and services that our
   customers need not the products we hope they need.

Build quality in

   The key to happy customers is quality in everything we do.  We do not
   dump responsibility for quality on a QA team. Everyone in the team is
   responsible for the quality of their work whether that is testing their
   code, writing clear documentation, or presenting technical solutions to
   customers.

Data drives us and we are data-driven

   At BetBuddy we think critically about data. We are open-minded and
   experiment to back-up our instincts.  We love to dive deeper to see
   what we can learn - we challenge assumptions.  We measure success and
   use evidence and research to drive key decisions.

Learning and personal growth

   The most valuable resource we have is our people.  BetBuddy development
   staff are committed to learning and personal growth.  That’s why we
   invest in our staff through one-on-ones and mentorship programs. We
   also allow team members to devote 10% of their time to learn new
   methods and technologies outside their core day-to-day tasks.

Reflect and improve

   We can never move forward unless we look back.  We value learning from
   our experiences.  Reflecting on past issues are not opportunities to
   level blame.  They are opportunities to learn.  Team members are
   empowered with responsibility and therefore not afraid to admit
   mistakes because they know we will ask ‘How can we prevent that in the
   future?’ not ‘Why did you screw up?’
