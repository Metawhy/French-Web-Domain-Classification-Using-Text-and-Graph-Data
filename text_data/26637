Perfect Keto Party Food

   Going to parties while eating Keto can be so tricky. Almost everything
   is either filled with carbs or covered in something sugary. But this
   deviled eggs recipe tastes amazing and are perfectly Keto!

St. Patrick‚Äôs Day Side Dish

   Since they are such a happy shade of green, my favorite time to make
   them is in March, at my St. Patrick‚Äôs Day party. They remind me of the
   luck of the Irish and are just so beautiful!

Other Holidays and Parties

   At what other holidays or events can you serve these eggs? Since they
   are so green, think about how that color fits in the theme. Here are
   some of my favorite occasions just to give you a few ideas:
     * Birthdays
     * Christmas ‚Äì add some paprika on top for red + green
     * Halloween ‚Äì add edible googly eyes to make them ‚Äúspooky‚Äù
     * Earth Day
     * Cookouts
     * Dr. Seuss parties (green eggs!)
     * National Deviled Egg Day ‚Äì Saturday, November 2nd!

     * Eggs
     * Avocado
     * Mayonaise
     * Lime juice
     * Garlic
     * Jalapeno pepper
     * Cayenne pepper

Is Mayo Keto Friendly?

   The only ingredient in this recipe that might not be the most Keto is
   the mayo. However, it is possible to find mayo that is low-carb.

   All you need to do is read the label. If it has added sugar, don‚Äôt buy
   it or use it. You can easily find sugar-free mayo in the store.

   If you want to, you can also make your own zero-carb Mayo at home.

How to Make Beautiful Deviled Eggs

   How do you make deviled eggs look beautiful? The secret is to use a
   frosting piping bag!

   You can make the filling in a bowl, then put it in a piping bag. Then,
   just pipe the filling into the eggs.

   Some people like using different piping tips for different looks. Have
   fun with this step.

   And garnish the tops of the eggs. This gives it a final bit of pizzazz
   that will help them stand out.

   If you don‚Äôt care about making them look perfect, you always just spoon
   the filling into the eggs. That‚Äôs what I did in these pictures.

   No matter how I do it, no one has ever complained about how these
   deviled eggs look. That‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt last long enough on the
   platter before they‚Äôre gobbled up.

How to Boil Eggs

   When you make deviled eggs, you want hard boiled eggs, not soft boiled.
   A harder boiled egg will have a firmer egg white.

   Here is my no-fail method for making the perfect hard-boiled eggs:
    1. Put eggs in a saucepan, cover with lightly salted water an inch
       above the eggs.
    2. Bring to a rolling boil on high heat.
    3. As soon as it starts boiling, turn off the heat and cover. Let sit
       on the burner for 10 minutes.
    4. When the timer goes off, remove eggs from the burner and drain the
       water.
    5. Place eggs in a bowl of ice water to cool for a few minutes.

How do you get hard boiled eggs to peel easily?

   This can be super frustrating, I know! You try to peel the eggs and the
   egg whites break and come off with the shell.

   I have a few tips that I‚Äôve learned over the years.
     * Use older eggs. The fresher the eggs, the more difficult they are
       to peel.
     * Ice water bath. Submerge boiled eggs in ice water ‚Äì this will help
       the be easier to peel too.
     * Make pressure cooker hardboiled eggs. This method is fool-proof and
       hardboiled eggs have never been easier to peel.

       I wasn‚Äôt sure at first about using avocado in for deviled eggs. But
       I was looking for something a little different and so so why not?
       So glad I did. So yummy! And yes I used a piping bag like you
       suggested. They turned out really pretty:)
