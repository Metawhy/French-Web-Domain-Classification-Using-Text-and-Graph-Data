A young princess and knight in training must battle her way through the
forces of evil to save her family with the assistance of her previously
deceased dog Fritzy!


   Based on a story Christopher wrote after the loss of his first dog
   Champ at the age of 9. (So sad.. so sad :P) And made at the request of
   Madelyn who wanted to “Be in Ghosts n Ghosts to fight Green Head!” (She
   meant Ghouls’N Ghosts and the first boss Sheilder).


   While training with her father “The Warrior King” for the royal games
   held at her families castle, the young knight in training, Princess
   Madelyn is forced back to her village when a storm of fire erupts from
   the sky. Upon entering the throne room, the guards and her family are
   struck down by an evil being known as “The Horned Wizard”. In a valiant
   attempt to save his family, Madelyn’s puppy, Fritzy is mortally wounded
   by a blast of magic from the wizards skeletal palm. Her family is
   whisked away before her eyes. She will have to set about rescuing them
   alone…or will she!

A big bad bug – The beta testing has paid off!

   May 21st, 2014 Posted by Chris News No Comment yet

   Hey Everyone!

   So Bug testing has paid off. There was a game breaking bug that we need
   to make sure we have completely ironed out before launch. So to play it
   safe we are going to push the date back to the 10th of June. This bug
   can actually stop progression through the game and it may have occurred
   when we were removing objects to stop the game development program from
   crashing (event trigger will go blank when you delete an object but the
   event contents remain meaning they constantly trigger for no reason –
   this actually happened in several spots but the rest were minor).

   So now we have to go through the code very carefully to make sure we’ve
   killed it properly! I think it was only in a few spots but you never
   know. The game has grown so big in size we may have cut and paste
   something somewhere and forgot about it.

   There were a few other minor bugs to squish but we’ve gotten most of
   them already. So sorry again for the delay, we are working hard to
   deliver a great experience to you the first time around!

   Chris
