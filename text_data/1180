What is Adzuna?

   Adzuna is a search engine for job ads that lists every job, everywhere.

   Our mission is to be the best place to start looking for a job. We
   search thousands of websites so you don't have to and bring together
   millions of ads so you can find every job, everywhere, via Adzuna. We
   provide smarter search options and powerful data about the job market,
   giving you the information you need to take control of your career.

Why do we do it?

   We know that looking for a job is a rollercoaster ride. As a team, we
   love using the awesome power of technology to help match people to
   better, more fulfilling jobs and keep New Zealand working.

When did Adzuna begin?

   Adzuna founders Andrew Hunter and Doug Monro met working at Gumtree in
   2005. We stayed in the local internet space for the next 5 years with
   Qype and Zoopla but kept in touch and finally hatched the Adzuna plan
   in 2010 on the back of an envelope in a central London pub. The site
   went live in April 2011.

     What does "Adzuna" actually mean?
     "Zuna" means "abundance" in a number of African languages. We aim to
     be the most abundant classified ads site on the web, and to bring
     you the best ads sooner than anyone else. Hence the name Ad-zuna.

   statistics relating to the Program provided to Publisher by Adzuna; and
   (c) any other information designated in writing by Adzuna as
   "Confidential" or an equivalent designation.

   General

   Adzuna makes no warranty that (i) the service will be uninterrupted,
   secure, timely or error-free; (ii) any errors in the service will be
   corrected. Adzuna shall not be liable for any direct or indirect
   damages incurred by the publisher from participation in the program,
   however caused. In no event shall Adzuna's aggregate liability exceed
   the amount of fees then due to the publisher as determined by these
   terms. Adzuna reserves the right to change these terms at any time.
