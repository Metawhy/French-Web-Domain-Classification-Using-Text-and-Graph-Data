Review of Mode Record's JACK Quartet

   It has been nearly a decade since the last new recording featuring the
   music of radical Romanian composer Horatiu Radulescu. That 2007 disc,
   entitled Intimate Rituals, showcased two of Radulescu’s most
   distinctive works for strings: his Das Andere, Op. 49 for solo viola,
   and his Intimate Rituals XI, Op. 63 for viola and “sound icon,” his
   signature “augmented” instrument, a grand piano turned on its side and
   played with rosined strings. Radulescu was sixty-four years old at the
   time of that release, and had firmly established himself on the
   European new music scene as a visionary with an intensely
   uncompromising approach, self-described as spectralism.

   Review of Phill Niblock's 'Winter Solstice'
   The winter solstice has long held deep significance for cultures dating
   back to as far as the Neolithic period. Some of civilisation's oldest
   monuments, from Stonehenge to Newgrange, are carefully aligned on sight
   lines pointing toward the winter solstice sunrise and sunset. And it's
   no surprise for the day marked the middle of winter, giving early man a
   crucial indicator – a signpost that guided food consumption for the
   remaining winter months – but on an even deeper level, the winter
   solstice signified for ancient pagan peoples the beginning of a
   rebirth, marking the resurrection of a beloved sun god and the gradual
   reawakening of nature.

Interview with Ben Johnston

   Recently elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and
   Letters at the age of 92, Ben Johnston is taking some time to reflect
   on his life’s work. As a composer who radically pushed the expressive
   possibilities of non-tempered harmony for over six decades, Johnston
   holds an important position in 20th-century American music, bridging
   the gap between Harry Partch’s explorations and centuries-old Western
   instrumental forms. Johnston spoke to me, with family at his side, from
   his home in Madison, Wisconsin, where he is battling the late-stage
   effects of Parkinson’s disease.

Horatiu Radulescu's Fifth String Quartet

   This article examines various aspects relating to Horatiu Radulescu's
   Fifth Quartet ​before the universe was born: the work's formal
   construction, with a focus on its notation and overall large-scale
   harmonic development; the Quartet's rhythmic devices and their link to
   the philosophical underpinnings that drive the work; the extended
   instrumental string techniques employed throughout, the sounds they
   achieve, and how they are executed; and the work's spectral pitch
   organisation.
