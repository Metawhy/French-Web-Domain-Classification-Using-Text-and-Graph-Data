Should a grammatical article be a part of a web link anchor

   When hyperlinking a noun in a webpage (or in an application), which is
   a part of a longer text/sentence, should a grammatical article (such as
   "a" in English) be a part of a link anchor text?

   I.e., which of the following is correct from a point of view of native
   English speaker?

     A cat is a mammal.

     A cat is a mammal.

   I'm not sure if this may vary with a language. In my native language,
   there are no articles. It may actually be a trivial question for native
   English speaker.

   In carefully edited text, the choice to include the article depends on
   the meaning. Examples:

     I saw a newt yesterday, dark with blue spots. Can anybody help
     identify it?

   — Article not included: the reader guesses that the linked page is
   about newts in general.

     I saw a newt yesterday, dark with blue spots. Can anybody help
     identify it?

   —Article included: the reader guesses that the linked page is about
   that specific newt.

   Sometimes it makes no difference:

     A newt is an amphibian.
     A newt is an amphibian.

   —The meaning of “a newt” and “newt” in this case is the same. Regarding
   usability, the longer form is a bit easier to click, but also a bit
   more distracting.

       This is an excellent observation! I hadn't realized it, but your
       first two examples are exactly how I'd interpret the links. And
       without this answer I wouldn't have known to use that when writing.

   Usually an article need not be a part of your link.

   Except in the cases when it makes a difference in meaning. Usually it
   will be a definite article, like "The Times", "El Salvador", "Al
   Jazeera".

   Sometimes you can see Portugal city Porto spelled as O Porto. This is
   because porto means just "port" in Portuguese, so the city is not just
   Port, but "The Port".

   Strictly speaking, Los in Los Angeles is also an article, but you
   definitely don't want to exclude it.

   For indefinite articles, like a in English or un/une in French, you can
   treat them as a numerical "one":

     one mammal.

   Rarely it needs to be together with your main word in a link.

   (This is my own hack for English articles as I'm also not a native
   speaker).

       Oct 2 at 4:26
     * If "los" was an article, it would be "los Angeles", not "Los
       Angeles" - it's part of the name / proper noun. Like your example
       "The Times" is not "the Times". – freedomn-m Oct 2 at 11:19
     * @freedomn-m I am amused at baseball games that include "The Los
       Angeles Angels", which one could translate as "The The Angels
       Angels". If they're playing the Yankees or Mets, from "New York,
       New York", so much the better. – Monty Harder Oct 2 at 19:59

   As the search bots don't give importance for this stop words (the, a,
   an...) you don't need to hyperlink them.

   What's Stop Words on Wikipedia:

     In computing, stop words are words which are filtered out before
     processing of natural language data (text). Stop words are generally
     the most common words in a language; there is no single universal
     list of stop words used by all natural language processing tools,
     and indeed not all tools even use such a list. Some tools avoid
     removing stop words to support phrase search.

     Any set of words can be chosen as the stop words for a given
     purpose. For some search engines, these are some of the most common,
     short function words, such as the, is, at, which, and on. In this
     case, stop words can cause problems when searching for phrases that
     include them, particularly in names such as "The Who", "The The", or
     "Take That". Other search engines remove some of the most common
     words—including lexical words, such as "want"—from a query in order
     to improve performance.

     In SEO terminology, stop words are the most common words that most
     search engines avoid, saving space and time in processing large data
     during crawling or indexing. This helps search engines to save space
     in their databases.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I believe that the decision to hyperlink a word never should be related
   to a grammatic and yes for SEO. Because for a user it doesn't matter if
   you add on the whole phrase, on click here or on a single word. For
   them, you must need to be clear that they have a link to another
   content.

       Thanks for your answer. It's an interesting point of view. Though I
       was not asking for SEO reasons. I was rather asking, what is
       correct from user/grammatical point of view. – Martin Prikryl Oct 1

       Could you reword this bit: "the decision to hyperlink a word never
       should be related to agrammatic and yes for SEO"? It's not
       grammatical. Do you mean "the decision to hyperlink a word should
       primarily be concerned about SEO, not grammar"? – John Kugelman Oct
       1 at 18:03

       I don't think this answers the question: If search engines don't
       care about whether you add an article to the link, then SEO does
       not matter for this question. – JiK Oct 2 at 9:40
     * 8
       Further, I believe that websites and hyperlinks should be designed
       primarily for human readers, not for search engines. – JiK Oct 2 at
       9:40

       And if someone thinks users don't care about what parts of the text
       are links, I'd ask them to consider the link to the Wikipedia page
       about the symbol at the end of this sentence. Or the link to the
       Wikipedia page about the symbol at the end of this sentence. For
       me, the second one is a lot clearer and easier to click. – JiK Oct

   I would encourage including the article: not for SEO, only partially
   for grammar, but to increase accessibility .... if it's a mouse-based
   user-base or mobile app where finger-actions are most important. Larger
   targets are easier to click.

   However, for screen-readers, I would encourage not only not omitting
   the article, but (when possible) allow links to have different first
   letters.

   Screen Readers such as JAWS (what I am most familiar with) allow the
   user to press a key-combination that brings up a Links List. (In JAWS
   it's INSERT+F7). Within this list, they can arrow down to find the link
   they want, or they can navigate by typing the first letter until the
   one they want is read. So then "mammal" would be preferable to "a
   mammal" -- there are fewer ones beginning with M, so it makes
   navigation faster.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Bonus accessibility tip from a bad experience: Don't start link or
   form-field names with unicode characters such as ✉ or ☖ . JAWS reads
   the second one as "White Shogi Piece" (that was before the word "Home"
   in all links on the screen) -- it was the only instance for that
   character, but a user can't type that! And every checkbox began with ✉
   or 📱 to indicate emails or text-messages being sent -- in tables with
   almost 100 entries! (Again, screen readers use a Select-a-form-field
   dialog list, which would have allowed first-letter-navigation, if not
   for these characters.)

       Interesting. Note, however, that whatever characters you use
       nowadays (like “a” or “7”) are Unicode characters. “Use only your
       target readers’ keyboard-accessible characters” may be a more
       usable recommendation. – Philippe-André Lorin Oct 3 at 10:45
     * Or if you use Unicode characters solely as icons, mark them up as
       such. – Jonas Schäfer Oct 3 at 12:41
     * Good point. Keyboard-accessible is always the key. We just had to
       figure out what to call them in the documentation, so our team went
       with "Unicode graphical characters" on first reference, and then
       "Unicode characters" thereafter. – April Oct 3 at 13:54

How a UX designer work in a data science oriented project?

   I am a UX designer in a AI research team in financial banking system.
   We are doing half data science oriented projects and half research work
   on AI.

   Most of our projects are on the credit or client score prediction,
   financial distress prediction, etc. They are pretty much data science
   oriented projects. I am the only UX designer in our team. It is
   interesting to participate in the data science project and learn new
   things. However, I had zero experience in working with data scientists.

   The key difference between a software development project and data
   science project is that for a software development project, we build
   things that satisfy the user's needs, and there is always a delivery.
   However, in data science project, we do not know if it is possible to
   predict something, because data scientists need to experiment and try
   to find the insight from the data. Data science solutions do not always
   come with a delivery.

   I found it is relatively easy to identify users from a software
   development project, because we have specific requirement to make,
   while it is hard to identify users from a data science project, as
   sometimes people just want to see if it is possible to do something
   with data science, the target is so ambiguous.

   Most of my work is dashboard design in analytics tools like Tableau, as
   a UI designer. Sometimes, it is also repetitive, I am kind of fed up
   with such things. I want to do some more interesting things like user
   research, to know what users think, how they behave and then
   experimenting.

   Here is my dilemma:

   I am interested to work in such a data science team, however, I do not
   have idea how to work with data scientists and what is my role as a
   designer in the data science project besides a UI designer.

   Does anyone have the experience as mine, and share some of your
   thoughts or ideas with me, please?

   Thanks :)

   There are different types of 'data science' projects, so you are
   definitely not limited to what you are able to do at the moment unless
   you have been given a very specific set of tasks to do.

   You might be surprised to find that data scientist apply a very similar
   approach to solving problems, in particular with the problem definition
   and solution validation stages as well as following an iterative
   process.

   The nature of the project will dictate whether you are helping them to
   create an interface to bridge the gap between hidden data and what they
   are exposing the end-users to, or perhaps coming up with a dashboard to
   summary or present the information for a more engaging narrative or
   decision making process.

   Just be aware that data scientist may have some strong views around
   data visualization, and that it will take some good arguments to help
   shape the visual design so a critical understanding of the underlying
   data is essential, but also educating them on aspects of user centred
   design that they are not as familiar with.

When and how present a warning message when fields are not valid anymore?

   Ask Question
   Asked 14 days ago

   I am working on a web app in which admin users can create forms, and
   editor users use those to create content. Admin can edit a form
   previously created and add warning validation based on specific content
   (determined by Regex).

   Warning message workflow:
    1. Admin created an "ABC" form with a "DFE" field with no warning
       validation method.
    2. User A fills an "ABC" form (with title "ABC1").
    3. Admin edit "ABC" form, assign a new warning validation to "DFE"
       field.
    4. User A edit the "ABC1" form.

   Question: Although "ABC1" form field "DFE" was previously valid, it is
   now possibly not abiding by the new validation. If the field is not
   valid, when and how can we display the change that affects that field
   and its content?
   forms validation warnings

   I think that the answer might be dependent on what is technically
   feasible or practical rather than what you think is going to suit the
   user best (because introducing this type of change is already not ideal
   for the user).

   Also, I think you have to consider both scenarios regarding the
   validation A) a field without previous validation now being validated
   and B) a field with previous validation now not requiring validation.

   Since this seems to be a change that can impact a number of fields, it
   may not be feasible or practical to provide a warning/notification each
   time the condition becomes true for the particular user. Instead this
   would be best communicated at a system level message/notification
   informing users the impact of this change, so that when they see the
   discrepancies in the validation status of the fields in the form they
   will be able to act on it.

   Perhaps this is something you can also address at the individual input
   field level by adding to the label associated with the field to include
   the following statuses:
     * mandatory (red or *)
     * previously mandatory (grey or green with an appropriate
       symbol/icon)
     * mandatory - previously not mandatory (red or *)

Why are Progressive Web App Icons circular compared to their App counterparts

   Working on a PWA (progressive web app) and coming up with the app icon
   for it. There aren't many others around since it's pretty new but it
   seems a lot of PWAs use a circular icon to differentiate from the
   native app.

   Is there a particular reason they are choosing a circular icon compared
   to the many other options? Is this a standard or a guideline(coming
   from google it wouldn't be a surprise)?

       Can't simulate in my device... do you have the latest version of
       Chrome? or is it phone specific? Try updating you chrome or use
       another browser to do the same (not sure if they have such
       feature). Anyway, it could have been a strategy from Google to keep
       it separate from native app icons but as any app can have a
       circular icon, they might have decided to scrap it. – Harshit

     * I don't know for sure, but I know that Google's newest Android
       phone, the Pixel, uses circular icons for most of its application
       launchers. So Google does seem to be at least experimenting with a
       design language where "circular icons = apps", even though that is
       not currently part of the Material design guidelines for launcher
       icons. – calum_b Dec 15 '16 at 17:27

   These days the difference between web applications and native apps are
   quite blurred... but in terms of the question that you asked about the
   icons, I think it is hard to say whether the shape of the icon is
   linked to how the application is developed.

   If anything, the shape of the icon will probably be determined by
   existing guidelines for the native application's development platform
   (e.g. Windows, Android or Apple), and even these will evolve over time
   so you have to look at apps of similar timeline. Then there will be
   additional branding guidelines dictated by the company and their
   marketing teams, and you might even have to delve into sub-brands.

   There is definitely a need to differentiate between the web vs. native
   application, but I have not come across any guidelines or standards
   that define the shape of the icon which relates to the technology being
   used to develop them.
