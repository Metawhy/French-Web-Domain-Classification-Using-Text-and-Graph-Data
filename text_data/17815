   The cookies we place on behalf of companies and their brands (the
   advertisers) on websites that sell advertising space

   We have created a targeted and serving technology platform that is used
   by our clients and advertisers to buy and deliver online advertising,
   including targeted and behavioural advertising (as explained above and
   in our privacy policy ), mostly through real-time bidding (the
   Platform).

The Platforms uses cookies to facilitate targeted delivery of our clients'
online advertising campaigns.

   Cookie Names

   Purpose

   idb

   This cookie contains a unique randomly-generated value that enables the
   Platform to distinguish browsers and devices. It is matched against
   information – such as advertising interest segments and histories of
   ads shown in the browser or device – provided by clients or other third
   parties and stored on the Platform. This information is used by clients
   to select advertisements for delivery by the Platform and to measure
   the performance of those advertisements. In addition, to enable clients
   to use non-PII (Personal Identifiable Information) they collect outside
   the Platform or acquire from other third parties, this cookie is
   sometimes matched to clients' or other third parties' cookies that
   contain such non-PII. For more information about information collected
   and used on the Platform, see our Privacy Policy.

   idb (opt out)

   When a user opts out from receiving the Platform's Adverts, the unique
   value in uuid2 is deleted and replaced with the non-unique value "AA".

Cookie consent and opting out

   To comply with current legislation, we need to ask for your consent to
   set cookies on our own website: http://video.calato.com/

   When you arrive on our website a pop-up message will appear informing
   you that we would like to place cookies on your device. If you, or
   another user of your computer, wish to withdraw your consent at any
   time, you can do so by altering your browser settings otherwise we will
   assume that you are happy to receive cookies from our website.

   Similarly, if you would like to stop receiving behavioural advertising
   cookies placed by us on behalf of companies and their brands (the
   advertisers) on websites that sell advertising space, you can also do
   by altering your browser settings and by visiting
   www.allaboutcookies.org and http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/.

   For mobile devices we may use persistent user profile data to target
   advertising (also known as behavioural, or interest-based advertising)
   in order to provide ads that are likely to be more interesting and more
   relevant to mobile device users. In addition to cookies, we sometimes
   use device identifiers to help us track whether you complete specific
   actions on an advertiser's mobile web site or application, as this is
   needed for analytical purposes. These cookies or identifiers use the
   domain name cabla.to and expire within 30 days.

   If you wish to block these cookies, you will need to change the
   relevant settings on your mobile device. Some, but not all, mobile
   platforms allow you to manage settings specifically for the cabla.to
   domain; on others you can only control cookies at a global level.
   Details on how to do this vary based on your mobile device operating
   system and browser, but common cases can be addressed as follows:

   may check the details you provide with fraud prevention agencies and
   share your information with them if we suspect fraud. It is important
   that you don’t provide false, inaccurate information or impersonate
   another individual.

   We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal
   data about you which we have grouped together follows:
     * Identity Data includes first name, last name and title.
     * Contact Data includes billing address, residential or registered
       company address, email address and telephone numbers.
     * Financial Data includes bank account and credit card numbers.
     * Transaction Data includes details about payments to and from you
       and other details of Services you have purchased from us.
     * Technical Data includes internet protocol (IP) address, your login
       data, browser type and version, time zone setting and location,
       browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform
       and other technology on the devices you use to access the Site and
       Platform.
     * Profile Data includes your unique account reference number, actions
       or transactions made by you on the Platform, preferences, feedback,
       survey responses and other correspondence.
     * Usage Data includes information about how you use our Site,
       Platform and Services.
     * Marketing and Communications Data includes your preferences in
       receiving marketing from us, and your communication preferences.

   We also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or
   demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data may be derived from
   your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this
   data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example,
   we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users
   accessing a specific Site feature or the number of Service types that
   are purchased. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with
   your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you,
   we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in
   accordance with this privacy notice.

   We do not collect any Special Categories of Personal Data about you
   (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or
   philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political
   opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and
   genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about
   criminal convictions and offences.
   If you fail to provide personal data

   Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a
   contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when
   requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are
   trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with the
   Services). In this case, we may have to cancel delivery of the Service
   you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the
   time.

How is your personal data collected?

   We use different methods to collect data from and about you including
   through:
     * Direct interactions. You may give us your Identity and Contact by
       filling in forms, providing documentation or by corresponding with
       us by post, phone, email or otherwise. This includes personal data
       you provide when you:

          + create an account for our Platform or otherwise;
          + contact us to report a problem with the Site, Platform or

   commonly, we will use your personal data in the following
   circumstances:
     * Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or
       have entered into with you.
     * Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a
       third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not
       override those interests.
     * Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.

   Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing
   your personal data other than in relation to sending third party direct
   marketing communications to you via email or text message. You have the
   right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us.

Marketing

   We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data
   uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.

Promotional offers from us

   We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to
   form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of
   interest to you. This is how we decide which Services and offers may be
   relevant for you and send to you through our marketing messages.

   You will receive marketing messages from us if you have requested
   information from us or purchased Services from us and you have not
   opted out of receiving that marketing.

Opting out

   You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages
   at any time by contacting us or unsubscribing from our marketing list.
   Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not
   apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a Service
   purchase, warranty registration, Service experience or other
   transactions.

Cookies

   Our Site uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our Site.
   This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our
   Site and allows us to improve our Site. We only use cookies as outlined
   in our Cookie Policy.

Change of purpose

   We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we
   collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for
   another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.
   If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new
   purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.

   If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will
   notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do
   so.
   Please note that we may process your personal data without your
   knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is
   required or permitted by law.
     * Disclosures of your personal data

   We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below
   for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above.
     * Our company group, including any subsidiaries.
     * Service providers who provide payment, marketing, IT and system
       administration services.
     * Professional advisers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and
       insurers based within the EU who provide consultancy, banking,
       legal, insurance and accounting services.
     * Regulators and other authorities based in the United Kingdom who
       require reporting of processing activities in certain
       circumstances, especially in the prevention of money laundering and
       fraud.
     * Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge
       parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to
       acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to
       our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the
       same way as set out in this privacy notice.
     * We require all third parties to respect the security of your
       personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not
       allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data
       for their own purposes and only permit them to process your
       personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our
       instructions.
     * International transfers
     * Some of our external third party suppliers are based outside the
       European Economic Area (“EEA"). Their processing of your personal
       data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.
     * Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a
       similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least
       one of the following safeguards is implemented:
     * We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have
       been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal
       data by the European Commission. For further details, see European
       Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU
       countries.
     * Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific
       contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal
       data the same protection it has in Europe.
     * Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to
       them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to
       provide similar protection to personal data shared between the EEA
       and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US
       Privacy Shield.
     * Data security

   We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your
   personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an
   unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to
   your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other
   third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process
   your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty
   of confidentiality.

   We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal
   data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a
   breach where we are legally required to do so. These procedures are
   outlined in our Data Security Policy.

How long will you use my personal data for?

   We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to
   fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of
   satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

   To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we
   consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the
   potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your
   personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and
   whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the
   applicable legal requirements.

   In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it
   can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical
   purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without
   further notice to you.

Your legal rights

   Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws
   in relation to your personal data.
     * Access to information: You have the right to request a copy of the
       information Cablato holds about you.
     * Ensuring accuracy of information: Cablato wants to make sure that
       your personal information is accurate and up-to-date. You may ask
       Cablato to correct or complete information that is inaccurate or
       incomplete.
     * Right to erasure: You may have a right to erasure, which is more
       commonly known as the ‘right to be forgotten’. This means that in
       certain circumstances you can require Cablato to delete personal
       information held about you.
     * Ability to restrict processing: You may also have the right to
       require Cablato to restrict Cablato’s use of your personal
       information in certain circumstances. This may apply, for example,
       where you have notified Cablato that the information Cablato holds
       about you is incorrect and you would like Cablato to stop using
       such information until Cablato has verified that it is accurate.
     * Right to data portability: You may have the right to receive
       personal data Cablato holds about you in a format that enables you
       to transfer such information to another data controller (e.g. such
       as another service provider).
     * Review by an independent authority: You will always have the right
       to lodge a complaint with a supervisory body, including ICO as
       listed above.
     * Preventing direct marketing: Cablato does not sell your personal
       data. From time to time, Cablato may send emails containing
       information about new features and other news about us. This is
       considered direct marketing. Cablato will always inform you if
       Cablato intends to use your personal data or if Cablato intends to
       disclose your information to any third party for such purposes.
     * Objecting to other uses of your information: You may also have the
       right to object to Cablato’s use of your information in other
       circumstances. In particular, where you have consented to Cablato’s
       use of your personal data, you have the right to withdraw such
       consent at any time.

   If you would like further information on how you can exercise these
   rights, please email us at privacy@cablato.com.

   No fee usually required

   You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to
   exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable
   fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
   Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these
   circumstances.

   What we may need from you

   We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm
   your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to
   exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to
   ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no
   right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further
   information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

   Time limit to respond

   We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
   Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is
   particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this
   case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

   We may also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our
   server, to administer our website and to improve the service we offer
   to you. An IP address is a numeric code that identifies your computer
   on a network, or in this case, the internet. Your IP address might also
   be used to gather broad demographic information.

   The cookies we place on behalf of companies and their brands (the
   advertisers) on websites that sell advertising space

   We have created a targeted and serving technology platform that is used
   by our clients and advertisers to buy and deliver online advertising,
   including targeted and behavioural advertising (as explained above and
   in our privacy policy ), mostly through real-time bidding (the
   Platform).

The Platforms uses cookies to facilitate targeted delivery of our clients'
online advertising campaigns.

   Cookie Names

   Purpose

   idb

   This cookie contains a unique randomly-generated value that enables the
   Platform to distinguish browsers and devices. It is matched against
   information – such as advertising interest segments and histories of
   ads shown in the browser or device – provided by clients or other third
   parties and stored on the Platform. This information is used by clients
   to select advertisements for delivery by the Platform and to measure
   the performance of those advertisements. In addition, to enable clients
   to use non-PII (Personal Identifiable Information) they collect outside
   the Platform or acquire from other third parties, this cookie is
   sometimes matched to clients' or other third parties' cookies that
   contain such non-PII. For more information about information collected
   and used on the Platform, see our Privacy Policy.

   idb (opt out)

   When a user opts out from receiving the Platform's Adverts, the unique
   value in uuid2 is deleted and replaced with the non-unique value "AA".

Cookie consent and opting out

   To comply with current legislation, we need to ask for your consent to
   set cookies on our own website: http://video.calato.com/

   When you arrive on our website a pop-up message will appear informing
   you that we would like to place cookies on your device. If you, or
   another user of your computer, wish to withdraw your consent at any
   time, you can do so by altering your browser settings otherwise we will
   assume that you are happy to receive cookies from our website.

   Similarly, if you would like to stop receiving behavioural advertising
   cookies placed by us on behalf of companies and their brands (the
   advertisers) on websites that sell advertising space, you can also do
   by altering your browser settings and by visiting
   www.allaboutcookies.org and http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/.

   For mobile devices we may use persistent user profile data to target
   advertising (also known as behavioural, or interest-based advertising)
   in order to provide ads that are likely to be more interesting and more
   relevant to mobile device users. In addition to cookies, we sometimes
   use device identifiers to help us track whether you complete specific
   actions on an advertiser's mobile web site or application, as this is
   needed for analytical purposes. These cookies or identifiers use the
   domain name cabla.to and expire within 30 days.

   If you wish to block these cookies, you will need to change the
   relevant settings on your mobile device. Some, but not all, mobile
   platforms allow you to manage settings specifically for the cabla.to
   domain; on others you can only control cookies at a global level.
   Details on how to do this vary based on your mobile device operating
   system and browser, but common cases can be addressed as follows:

iOS Users

   iOS 6: Turn on the "Limit Ad Tracking" feature directly on your device.
   To do this, go to Settings -> General -> About -> Advertising from your
   iOS home screen.

   Please note that this will disable all ad tracking on your device, not
   just Cablato's services.

   iOS 7+: Turn on the "Limit Ad Tracking" feature directly on your
   device. To do this, go to Settings -> Privacy -> Advertising -> Limit
   Ad Tracking.

   Please note that this will disable all ad tracking on your device, not
   just Cablato's services.

Android Users

   Android 2.3+: Opt out of interest-based ads directly on your device
   through Google Settings > Ads > Opt out of interest-based ads.

   Please note that this will disable all ad tracking on your device, not
   just Cablato's services. If you wish to opt out only from Cablato's
   services, please copy your advertising ID (Google Settings > Ads > Your
   advertising ID) in the box below and click 'Opt Out'.

   Please allow up to 7 days for your request to be processed and deployed
   within our systems.

   The cookies we place on behalf of companies and their brands (the
   advertisers) on websites that sell advertising space

   We have created a targeted and serving technology platform that is used
   by our clients and advertisers to buy and deliver online advertising,
   including targeted and behavioural advertising (as explained above and
   in our privacy policy ), mostly through real-time bidding (the
   Platform).

The Platforms uses cookies to facilitate targeted delivery of our clients'
online advertising campaigns.

   Cookie Names

   Purpose

   idb

   This cookie contains a unique randomly-generated value that enables the
   Platform to distinguish browsers and devices. It is matched against
   information – such as advertising interest segments and histories of
   ads shown in the browser or device – provided by clients or other third
   parties and stored on the Platform. This information is used by clients
   to select advertisements for delivery by the Platform and to measure
   the performance of those advertisements. In addition, to enable clients
   to use non-PII (Personal Identifiable Information) they collect outside
   the Platform or acquire from other third parties, this cookie is
   sometimes matched to clients' or other third parties' cookies that
   contain such non-PII. For more information about information collected
   and used on the Platform, see our Privacy Policy.

   idb (opt out)

   When a user opts out from receiving the Platform's Adverts, the unique
   value in uuid2 is deleted and replaced with the non-unique value "AA".

Cookie consent and opting out

   To comply with current legislation, we need to ask for your consent to
   set cookies on our own website: http://video.calato.com/

   When you arrive on our website a pop-up message will appear informing
   you that we would like to place cookies on your device. If you, or
   another user of your computer, wish to withdraw your consent at any
   time, you can do so by altering your browser settings otherwise we will
   assume that you are happy to receive cookies from our website.

   Similarly, if you would like to stop receiving behavioural advertising
   cookies placed by us on behalf of companies and their brands (the
   advertisers) on websites that sell advertising space, you can also do
   by altering your browser settings and by visiting
   www.allaboutcookies.org and http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/.

   For mobile devices we may use persistent user profile data to target
   advertising (also known as behavioural, or interest-based advertising)
   in order to provide ads that are likely to be more interesting and more
   relevant to mobile device users. In addition to cookies, we sometimes
   use device identifiers to help us track whether you complete specific
   actions on an advertiser's mobile web site or application, as this is
   needed for analytical purposes. These cookies or identifiers use the
   domain name cabla.to and expire within 30 days.

   If you wish to block these cookies, you will need to change the
   relevant settings on your mobile device. Some, but not all, mobile
   platforms allow you to manage settings specifically for the cabla.to
   domain; on others you can only control cookies at a global level.
   Details on how to do this vary based on your mobile device operating
   system and browser, but common cases can be addressed as follows:
