About eduroam

   The eduroam initiative started in 2003 with 6 countries. The technology
   behind eduroam is based on the IEEE 802.1X standard and a hierarchy of
   RADIUS proxy servers. The task force created a test bed to demonstrate
   the feasibility of combining a RADIUS-based infrastructure with 802.1X
   standard technology to provide roaming network access across research
   and education networks. The initial test was conducted among five
   institutions located in the Netherlands, Finland, Portugal, Croatia and
   the UK. Later, other national research and education networking
   organisations in Europe embraced the idea and gradually started joining
   the infrastructure, which was then named eduroam.

eduroam Governance

   The Global eduroam Governance Committee was constituted in November
   2010 and currently comprises fifteen senior representatives of roaming
   operators in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America and
   Europe. Secretariat support is provided by the GÉANT Association, which
   finalised the charter for global eduroam governance after extensive
   consultation with eduroam leaders from these regions. The GeGC members
   are officially appointed by the GÉANT Association on the basis of
   nominations from their regional roaming operators or confederation.

   The GÉANT organisation coordinates and supports the Global eduroam
   Governance Committee (GeGC), which sets technical and organisational
   standards for the service and authorises compliant ROs to provide
   eduroam around the world.

   The members of the GeGC are senior representatives of ROs
   or confederations of ROs. Representatives for a world region that has a
   confederation – such as Europe – are nominated by the confederation. In
   world regions without confederations, the ROs must jointly
   nominate their GeGC representatives. The GeGC members are officially
   appointed by GÉANT on the basis of these nominations, and currently
   are:
     * Africa: Mohamed Aliouat, (ARN, Algeria), Kennedy Aseda (KENET,
       Kenya), Samuel Ouya (snRER, Senegal).
     * Asia-Pacific: Hideaki Goto (Tohoku University, Japan), Neil
       Witheridge (AARNet, Australia), Deokjai Choi (Chonnam National
       University, Korea).
     * Europe: Wenche Backman-Kamila (Funet/CSC, Finland), Paul Dekkers
       (SURFnet, Netherlands), Miroslav Milinović (Srce, Croatia).
     * Latin America: Luis Castro (CUDI, Mexico), Claudio Chacón (CEDIA,
       Ecuador), Jean Carlo Faustino (RNP, Brazil).
     * North America & Caribbean: Ann West (Internet2, USA), Chris
       Phillips (CANARIE, Canada), Reeve Ramharry (UWI, Trinidad &
       Tobago).

   The GeGC includes non-voting technical experts:
     * Stefan Winter (RESTENA, Luxembourg)
     * Philippe Hanset (ANYROAM, LLC, USA)

The GÉANT project is co-funded by Europe’s NRENs and the EU.

Key Reinstallation Attack and WPA2

   eduroam > News > Advisories > Key Reinstallation Attack and WPA2

   18th October 2017AdvisoriesBrook Schofield

   Recently, the news of the Key Reinstallation Attack (KRACK)
   vulnerability allowing the decryption of WPA2 messages being the key
   exploit was announced. This may open up additional vulnerabilities
   toward a wireless client and the security and integrity of their
   browsing traffic.

   KRACK is an attack against Wi-Fi infrastructure and clients, rather
   than against a specific wireless network. This means that eduroam is no
   more or less affected than any other Wi-Fi network, and there is
   nothing you need to specifically do for eduroam that you wouldn’t
   already need to do for any other Wi-Fi network.

   While there are no reports of this being actively exploited, the upside
   is that this is not a remote attack so, it can only happen within
   proximity of vulnerable access points and clients. This is not a
   service affecting issue and eduroam authentication infrastructure will
   continue to function normally and your login credentials
   (username/password or certificate) continue to be securely transmitted.
   It is recommended that technicians responsible for wireless networks
   closely monitor the availability of software updates for your vendor
   and patch as soon as possible. An intermediate solution is to disable
   802.11r (aka Fast Roaming) until an update is available.Update your
   phone, tablet and laptop as soon as patches are made available from
   your manufacturer to protect yourself from this vulnerability which can
   occur on all WPA2 networks (including your home, café, airport and
   other enterprise wireless networks).

   Legacy WPA & TKIP networks continue to be deprecated for a multitude
   of reasons and you shouldn’t re-enable this as it isn’t a solution to
   this problem and will cause issues. The best practice is currently (and
   remains) WPA2 + AES-CCMP.

   Additional information on this vulnerability can be found at SANS.
   Thanks to SURFnet, AARNet and TENET for information used in creating
   this advisory.
