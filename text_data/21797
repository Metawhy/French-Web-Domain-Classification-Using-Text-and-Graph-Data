ooh la la du jour!

   A perpetual list of all things we adore

Farewell...for now :)

   [mule.jpg]
    As you may have read in JP's previous post, he and I have decided to
   put Ooh La La on a bit of a hiatus while we regroup and think about
   what our next project may be. With so many things pulling us in so many
   directions, the duty to post was becoming just that...and that's
   something I never want it to become. Writing for a blog about things
   you adore should be a joy...and this was, from the moment it began back
   in the early summer of 2009. That summer was a tough one for me...and
   Ooh La La Du Jour was like a lovely and unexpected surprise in the
   middle of all that was during that time. But now, well, there are so
   many things pulling us all  in so many directions and maybe, Ooh La La
   Du Jour has just run its course.
   I personally want anyone and everyone who read and enjoyed this blog to
   know how much I deeply appreciate it. You all are what made it the
   fabulous experience that it was and knowing that we may have connected
   with even a few folks out there...well, that will always make me smile.
   If any of you are interested in keeping in touch, you may email me at
   oohlaladujour@gmail.com at any time. Send your ideas for future
   projects or anything else that might pop into you head :)
   I think I speak for KJ and JP when I say, thank you from the bottom of
   our hearts for allowing us to express ourselves and for taking the time
   to participate in our thoughts, hopes, dreams and wishes. Goodbye for
   now kids...you've been truly, delightful :)

Time to Refresh

   [annanicki.jpg]
   KatieP and I have decided to take a hiatus on ooh la la. KatieP will be
   writing her farewell post soon. I have absolutely adored this
   experience and am eager to see what projects lie ahead for both KatieP
   and myself. KJ is already up and running with her new Tumblr, which I
   love. I like this image as my last because it includes who I consider
   to be the patron saint of this blog sitting next to someone who, for
   me, represents the next generation of fashion icons. The story goes
   that, after this very event, Madame Wintour sent Miss Minaj a note that
   read "We matched!" Nicki Minaj saved that note and cherishes it dearly.
   Dear readers, please know that I cherish each and everyone of you!
   Sending much love and wishes for gorgeous fashion and delicious design.
   xoxo

Classic Trends

   [old-hollywood-white-pants-300x298.png]
   The always spot-on Julie Rath has just released her Trends in Menswear
   Report. I'm not sure I'm loving all the trends she's spotting but her
   interpretations of them are wonderful, like this outfit above. I'd love
   to be able to pull off white pants like this. It's never easy to take a
   trend and make it a classic. If anyone can do it, Julie can.

You Too Can be a Magazine Editor

   [polyvore.jpg]
   I know polyvore.com has come up on ooh la la before (maybe in the
   comments?) but I'm loving it so much I wanted another mention. For all
   you fashionistas out there who fancy trying on the hat of a magazine's
   Creative Director, you can try putting together fashion spreads
   yourself. And, if you love amazing collages, you'll find some great
   ones on this site!

A Wise Choice

   [owl.jpg]
   How cute are these bowls from Uncommon Goods? I can't imagine anything
   better to put my cereal in to brighten up my day in the morning.
   Delightful!

Natural Beauty

   [afro.png]
   Ever since I saw Good Hair, the amazing documentary that Chris Rock
   made about African American women's hair, I've been kind of obsessed
   with the subject. So I was super-thrilled to see this wonderful
   Kickstarter project that is really an homage to the afro. Afros really
   need to be celebrated because they're just about the most kick-ass
   hairdo a woman can have. (And I'm also really glad to have found a
   Kickstarter project that we can support on ooh la la that isn't fully
   funded yet. Give, give, give!)

Color Splash

   [bracelets.jpg]
   80s fashion is not my thing but I'm into these bracelets for those
   times when you've got a sedate outfit on, you're about to meet friends
   for drinks, and you need a quick splash of five different colors with
   one quick accessory.

Extinguishing Boring Design

   [fire.jpg]
   I think one of my favorite things in life is seeing something
   redesigned that I never expected to see redesigned. Fire Design
   decided, and rightly so, that the standard fire extinguisher design was
   getting old so they came up with a whole line of fun and funky designs.
   Hm... Though I love fire trucks as they are, I'm wondering if someone
   can take on a redesign of those boxy behemoths to come up with
   something truly functional and fun to look at, just like these fire
   extinguishers!

Traveling Cameras

   [dragon.jpg]
   This image was created on a disposable camera that traveled, in several
   hands, to Walt Disney World and the Middle East. The camera was one of
   many that was left in a random place by the Disposable Memory Project.
   When and if the cameras are returned to the project organizers, the
   resulting images and the camera's geographical path are documented on
   the site. Really a beautiful concept that continues to unfold slowly as
   cameras are returned. I love projects like this where so much is left
   up to chance. In a really great way, this taps into the collective
   creativity that exists within all of us.

More reasons to love spring

                                              [ks-emb.jpg]
    According to Refinery 29, due to arrive this April...Kate Spade nail
    polish. Please tell me I'm not dreaming. I might just fall over from
                            joy and excitement :)

Francoise

   [francoise.gilot.vogue.re.JPG]
   I am finally, finally getting a chance to catch up on my magazines at
   home...sadly, the April issue of Vogue arrived just as I finally had
   opened the March issue. At any rate, there is a fascinating article on
   Francoise Gilot and a new exhibit featuring her art along side Picasso.
   The thing that took my breath away was this picture of Gilot...at 90.
   Wait...what?!? Proving once again that French women are absolutely
   incredible.

   You know what I was just thinking...no more than a week ago...wouldn't
   it be amazing if the accessory queen Kate Spade had a line of those
   bracelets you all know I flip out for? Well, guess what I just
   discovered in the new arrival today...be still my heart..I want each
   and every single one :)

  Interior Design Treasure-Trove

   [lonny.jpg]
   I am loving Lonny Magazine right now. I think they're one of the most
   well done online magazines out there right now, especially for interior
   design. The current issue has some delicious design ideas from cover to
   cover.

Louis Vuitton Spring 2012

   [Louis-Vuitton-Spring-Summer-2012-campaign-1-541x800.jpg]
   What do you kids think of the Louis Vuitton Spring 2012 ad campaign.
   The images have been out there for a little while now but I always like
   to see them the old-fashioned way (on the pages of Vogue) before I
   judge. I have to say, I adore them. Even though I'm not super into
   pastels, and I'm way more preppy than frou-frou, this campaign is about
   as much fun as an ad can be. In a word...LOVE!
