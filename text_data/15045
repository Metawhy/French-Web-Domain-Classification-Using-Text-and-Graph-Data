   VASY (1996-2011) was a research team of INRIA and LIG working in the
   area of formal methods applied to safety-critical systems. The research
   activities of VASY encompassed formal specification languages and
   associated methodologies, compiling and rapid prototyping techniques,
   simulation, validation, verification, and testing. VASY developed
   advanced software tools, which have been used in numerous case-studies,
   and was involved in several technology transfer projects with
   industrial partners.
