   I first discovered the Amangiri on Instagram a little over 3 years ago
   and immediately added it to my bucket list of must-see places.

   Over the years I’m sure many of you have seen the resort pop up all
   over social media, but if you have not, be sure to click here to
   familiarize yourself with what is known to be one of the most luxurious
   hotels in the US. After we had the fortune to stay at the Aman property
   in Morocco {Amanjena}, I quickly moved the Utah location to the top of
   my list.

   Firstly, let me preface this review by saying this post is not
   sponsored, nor did we receive a discount to stay at the hotel. Which
   means yes, I started saving in January to pay for our $2,200 per night
   Desert Pool Suite {I know, it’s crazy expensive but I’m a sucker for a
   good hotel}.

The Location

   Let me start out by saying that this hotel is not easy to get to unless
   you have a private plane. We do not. The quickest way to get there is
   via the 4 hour drive from Las Vegas, which honestly isn’t so bad. There
   is also something kind of great about how difficult the resort is to
   get to. It makes it that much more special. By the time you arrive, you
   feel like you have really earned it and the mountains surrounding the
   hotel are absolutely picturesque.

Activities Galore

   There are plenty of activities to keep you very busy in the middle of
   nowhere at this resort. We opted for a guided tour of Rattlesnake
   Canyon, which was out of this world beautiful. I am still speechless
   over the spectacular rock formations and awe-inspiring detail in the
   canyons. I 100% recommend doing this if you are in the area. There is
   also horseback riding, rock climbing, boating on the lake, hot air
   balloon rides, spa treatments… you name it – they’ve got it.

The Bed

   I’d give their bed a 9/10 rating on my scale of comfortable beds which
   is very high. I slept like a baby and when I asked for a “firm” pillow
   they delivered. Although it could have been slightly more firm, but I’m
   being picky.

Food & Beverage

   You positively must get the pancakes for breakfast. It was the best I
   have ever had – thanks to a recommendation from my friend Marianna
   Hewitt. I was a bit surprised by how condensed the in-room dining menu
   was at first. Don’t get me wrong, everything was amazing, but for lunch
   and dinner there are only a handful of options.  By our third {and
   final} night, I was wanting something a bit different. Luckily, we
   phoned the kitchen and asked if they had any simple pasta. To our
   surprise, the chef whipped up the best spaghetti I’ve ever had and even
   treated our pup Polly to a homemade meal the next morning when we ran
   out of dog food. I was really impressed by this!

Must Do

   If you stay at the property with a significant other, please do
   yourself a favor and book the “Sunset Trail.” This was hands down the
   best thing we did while we were there. It was a very short 5 minute
   walk to a private hillside spot reserved for two through the concierge.
   We had rocking chairs, snacks and champagne all to ourselves while
   watching the sunset with nothing but silence and each other. It was
   quite special.

   Overall, if I was asked to spend that amount of money to stay at the
   Amangiri all over again I would do it in a heart beat. 3 nights at this
   remote escape felt like 3 weeks and the zen-like, minimal decor fed my
   mind, body and spirit more than I had ever dreamed of. It was truly a
   magical experience and one that I will treasure forever.

   If you ever have the opportunity to stay at this beautiful property, I
   say do it! Just tell them that the Damsel sent you… maybe next time
   they’ll give me a discount {kidding, sort of}.
