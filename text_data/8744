About

     * Photo of SENG LUANGRATH
    SENG LUANGRATH
    CHEF AND OWNER
       Chef Seng was born in Laos and fled the country during the Vietnam
       War. During her stay at a Thailand refugee camp of Nakhon Phanom,
       she learned how to cook from her camp neighbors and elders. At the
       age of twelve, she was the eldest of five and took on the role of
       caretaker of her four younger siblings in order to support her
       working mother. In 2009, at the age of 40 she decided to go after
       her greatest passion, cooking. She took over Padaek (previously
       Bangkok Golden) in 2010 and in 2014, she opened Thip Khao.

    BOBBY PRADACHITH
    CHEF AND OWNER
       Bobby Pradachith grew up in Northern Virginia in a Lao household.
       He felt lost within his family’s culture due to separate
       upbringings outside of home. As he sought to understand more about
       his family, he discovered food could help guide his learning
       journey. The opportunity to study in culinary school and to work
       under his chef-mother and the tutelages of other Chefs in several
       restaurants in DC and New York helped guide him, to continue to
       operate his family’s two restaurants. His sole ambitions are to
       preserve the integrity of the culture through food and to encourage
       the Lao-American communities to follow the journey of Lao story
       telling. He finds old historical contents, recipes, and art to be
       the inspirations within the menu.

    SENG LUANGRATH
    CHEF AND OWNER
       Chef Seng was born in Laos and fled the country during the Vietnam
       War. During her stay at a Thailand refugee camp of Nakhon Phanom,
       she learned how to cook from her camp neighbors and elders. At the
       age of twelve, she was the eldest of five and took on the role of
       caretaker of her four younger siblings in order to support her
       working mother. In 2009, at the age of 40 she decided to go after
       her greatest passion, cooking. She took over Padaek (previously
       Bangkok Golden) in 2010 and in 2014, she opened Thip Khao.

    BOBBY PRADACHITH
    CHEF AND OWNER
       Bobby Pradachith grew up in Northern Virginia in a Lao household.
       He felt lost within his family’s culture due to separate
       upbringings outside of home. As he sought to understand more about
       his family, he discovered food could help guide his learning
       journey. The opportunity to study in culinary school and to work
       under his chef-mother and the tutelages of other Chefs in several
       restaurants in DC and New York helped guide him, to continue to
       operate his family’s two restaurants. His sole ambitions are to
       preserve the integrity of the culture through food and to encourage
       the Lao-American communities to follow the journey of Lao story
       telling. He finds old historical contents, recipes, and art to be
       the inspirations within the menu.
