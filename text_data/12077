   Buckingham Palace Where does the Queen live? asked by Rebecca Canada

   The Queen lives in Buckingham Palace in London. She also has other
   homes too. Her favourite is Balmoral Castle in Scotland where she
   spends Christmas. Windsor Castle is another of the Queen's homes.

   Does the Queen live in Buckingham Palace all the time? asked by Erica -
   Canada

   No The Queen's has other places where she lives. Her Majesty's official
   residence in London is Buckingham Palace, but she also owns Balmoral
   Castle in Scotland and Sandringham House in Norfolk, which she
   inherited from her father.

     [guard2.jpg] What are the guards that stand in front of the castle
      wearing red coats and those large black fur hats? Are they called
             sentries or just guards? How come they don't move?

      They are called the Queen's Guard. They red tunics and bearskins
             (hats). Traditionally they are not allowed to move.

   Typically, a Guardsman spends two hours on duty and four off. He is not
   expected to stand still for any more than ten minutes at a time. Every
   so often, he will march up and down in front of his sentry box, rather
   like a policeman "walking the beat".
