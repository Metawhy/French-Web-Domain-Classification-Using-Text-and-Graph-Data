   3D Design & Modeling
   [3d-modeling-tablet-bg-@2x.jpg]
   Don't let your design tool limit your creativity and ability to quickly
   create multiple design iterations. Design how you want in all phases of
   the product development process.
   See 3D Modeling Features
   Created with Sketch.
   Simulation
   [simulation-tablet-bg-@2x.jpg]
   Don’t wait. Test your designs early in the development process to
   determine usability and uncover costly flaws.
   See Simulation Features
   Created with Sketch.
   Generative Design
   [generative-tablet-bg-@2.jpg]
   Expand your ability to innovate. Quickly generate high-performing
   design alternatives from a set of manufacturing and material
   constraints. Once a solution is chosen, edit your CAD-ready geometry.
   See Generative Design Features
   Created with Sketch.
   Documentation
   [documentation-tablet-bg-@2x.jpg]
   Avoid exporting. Easily derive 2D drawings directly from your 3D models
   to ensure manufacturing accuracy.
   See Documentation Features
   Created with Sketch.
   Collaboration
   [collaboration-tablet-bgnew.jpg]
   Don't let locations, time zones, and extensive reviews lengthen your
   development process. View all design data from a single project
   dashboard and easily collaborate with both internal and external
   stakeholders.
   See Collaboration Features
   Created with Sketch.
   Manufacturing
   [manufacturing-tablet-bg-@2x.jpg]
   Avoid costly rework, defects, and missed deadlines that impact your
   bottom line with truly integrated CAD + CAM. Utilize HSM technologies
   to quickly generate toolpaths that cut cycle times, reduce machine and
   tool wear, and produce high-quality finished parts.

   3D Design & Modeling
   [3d-modeling-tablet-bg-@2x.jpg]
   Don't let your design tool limit your creativity and ability to quickly
   create multiple design iterations. Design how you want in all phases of
   the product development process.
   See 3D Modeling Features
   Created with Sketch.
   Simulation
   [simulation-tablet-bg-@2x.jpg]
   Don’t wait. Test your designs early in the development process to
   determine usability and uncover costly flaws.
   See Simulation Features
   Created with Sketch.
   Generative Design
   [generative-tablet-bg-@2.jpg]
   Expand your ability to innovate. Quickly generate high-performing
   design alternatives from a set of manufacturing and material
   constraints. Once a solution is chosen, edit your CAD-ready geometry.
   See Generative Design Features
   Created with Sketch.
   Documentation
   [documentation-tablet-bg-@2x.jpg]
   Avoid exporting. Easily derive 2D drawings directly from your 3D models
   to ensure manufacturing accuracy.
   See Documentation Features
   Created with Sketch.
   Collaboration
   [collaboration-tablet-bgnew.jpg]
   Don't let locations, time zones, and extensive reviews lengthen your
   development process. View all design data from a single project
   dashboard and easily collaborate with both internal and external
   stakeholders.
   See Collaboration Features
   Created with Sketch.
   Manufacturing
   [manufacturing-tablet-bg-@2x.jpg]
   Avoid costly rework, defects, and missed deadlines that impact your
   bottom line with truly integrated CAD + CAM. Utilize HSM technologies
   to quickly generate toolpaths that cut cycle times, reduce machine and
   tool wear, and produce high-quality finished parts.
