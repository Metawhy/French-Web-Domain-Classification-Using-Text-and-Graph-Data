Blog CPR....is that a thing?

   If it is a thing, I think my blog needs it.
   It has been over a year since my last post.  I really enjoyed blogging,
   but life got in the way.  I returned to teaching in the fall and sent
   my little one off to preschool.  I started teaching a new grade
   level (2nd....LOVE!), at a new school (really close to home), with a
   new team (LOVE them!), using Common Core Standards (new to me), and my
   district adopted a new reading and math series.  To say it was a
   whirlwind year is putting it mildly.  I am now teaching at the school
   my daughter attends.  It's so nice going to school with her.  Our lunch
   times overlapped by a few minutes, so I could chat with her for a few
   minutes during the day.  It was great!  My son started preschool at our
   church last fall.  He LOVES it!  I am so proud of how well he
   adjusted.  His teacher was amazing and always kept me informed on
   things he was doing and even texted me pictures during the day.  It
   made going back to work a lot easier.
   Next year I will be teaching second grade again (yay!!).  I'm so glad
   I'll be able to fine tune what I did last year.  I'm working on stuff
   this summer to use next year.  I'll have to add some posts of my
   projects.
   During our family vacation I read The Book Whisperer by Donalyn
   Miller.  It was awesome!!!  Have you read it?  I just started her
   second book Reading in the Wild today when I was working out on the
   elliptical.  It's great so far.  She has really changed my thinking on
   several things.  What books are you reading this summer?

Toy Cars at Home and in the Classroom

   This week the kids and I have been playing with our ever
   growing collection of Hot Wheels and MatchBox cars.

   [CarsBag.jpg]

   It has been a ton of fun!  We have made a car show, a parade, a car
   wash in the tub, and had races on a ramp.  One afternoon we decided to
   sort our cars by color.  Madalyn is working on patterns in school so I
   had her use the cars to make various patterns (AB, AAB, ABC,
   AABB, etc.).  It got me thinking about how much fun it would be to use
   toy cars in the classroom.  Here are some of the ideas I came up with.
   The mats I made were just quick drafts for pictures and to let Madalyn
   play with.  I plan on making some mats on the computer that I can use
   in the classroom.

   [CarsColorSort.jpg]
   Sorting cars by color.  You could also use blank sorting mats and have
   your students come up with other ways to sort (by type of vehicle,
   number of doors, newer or older models, etc).

   [CarsPatternAB.jpg]

   [CarsPatternAAB.jpg]

                      Using the cars to make patterns.



   [CarsSightWord.jpg]
   Sight word mats that students can use to trace, or drive the letters of
   the word.

   [CarsLetters.jpg]

   [CarsNumbers.jpg]
   ﻿
    Letter or number mats that students can use to "drive" the shape of
   the letter or number.

   [SightWordCarParking.jpg]

      This is a sight word parking lot.  I made it last summer to help
     Madalyn learn her sight words.  It's an idea I saw on Pinterest.  I
    wrote a sight word on each parking space and had index cards with the
     sight words on them.  I would pick a card and read the word aloud.
    Madalyn would then "drive" one of her cars to that word and "park" in
                      that space.  It was a lot of fun!



   I think students would really enjoy using toy cars as manipulatives.
   Most of our cars were less than a dollar each.  Sometimes you can find
   them on clearance at Target, or even find sets of cars that would be
   cheaper than buying them individually.  I'm going to start picking up a
   few for my classroom every time I go to Target or Walmart.  I should
   have a good amount by fall when I'm back in the classroom.  I hope you
   can use some of my ideas in your classroom!﻿

Writing Center Idea/Repurposing Old Greeting Cards

   Hi!  It has been a few weeks since I posted.  Life has been keeping me
   very busy.  I have missed blogging, so I am hoping to get back in the
   swing of things.
   Today I have an easy writing center idea for you.  If you are like me
   you probably have several old greeting cards hanging
   around.  Don't toss them in the recycle bin just yet!  I have a fun way
   for you to repurpose them.  Cards with cute, funny, or interesting
   pictures on them can be great story starters for your students.  All
   you have to do is cut the words off the front of the card.  Here are a
   few examples of cards I decided to use.  I trimmed the cards so that
   all the wording was off.
   [WritingCenterIdeaCards.jpg]

   [WritingCenterIdeaCardsClosed.jpg]
   Next, glue a piece of card stock inside the greeting card to cover all
   the writing.  On the card stock I wrote words that students might need
   help spelling if they were writing a story about the picture on the
   cover.  You could also add story prompts on one side of the card and
   word spellings on the other.  I want to use the cards as story starters
   for creative writing so I opted to not use any prompts, but I could
   always add them later.  Here is a picture of the inside of some of the
   finished cards.
   [WritingCenterIdeaCardsOpen.jpg]


   I hope you enjoy today's writing center idea!  ﻿

Adding a Pin It Button

   I recently got a new blog design from the amazing Alicia at Dream Like
   Magic.  Love it!  After the install, I noticed that my "Pin It" button
   disappeared.  I just added it back today, so feel free to "Pin" away!
   I learned how to add the "Pin It" button from a great tutorial on Kevin
   & Amanda's blog.  You can find that post here.   I have found lots of
   other great tutorials and information on their blog.  Make sure you
   check out their great blog!

Spelling/Sight Word Practice Part 3

   I have a few more spelling and sight word practice ideas for you
   today.  The first one I call Spaghetti Spelling.  I have used this for
   years in my classroom and my students seem to always enjoy it.  It's
   easy to put together and fairly cheap to make.
   To make Spaghetti Spelling you will need:
     * 5 Sheets of red felt
     * Cream colored yarn (You can use white, but the cream colored looks
       closer to spaghetti)
     * A gallon Ziploc bag
        I rounded the corners of the felt to shape it like a plate or
       platter.  I thought red was a good fit because it would be like the
       sauce.  Cut the cream colored yarn in all different sizes.  You
       will want to cut a good amount so that you have enough for all the
       students in the center.  I usually have four or five students in
       each center group.  I always make sure I have enough materials for
       each student at the center.  Students will use the spelling word
       index cards to practice spelling their words.  The felt and yarn
       work well together because they cling to each other.  It makes it
       easier for students to manipulate the yarn into letters and keeps
       their frustration level down.  After they spell one word, they
       would select another card and spell that word.  I store all five
       felt mats and the pile of yarn in a gallon Ziploc labeled
       "Spaghetti Spelling".  It makes it easy for storing, set up and
       clean up.

   [WordWorkSpaghettiSpelling.jpg]
   This is a picture of how I store the center.
   [WordWorkSpaghettSpellingBag.jpg]
    Another idea is to use toothpicks to make letters to practice spelling
   words.  I suggest using the flat toothpicks.  They are not as sharp and
   lay flat so it's easier to make letters and you don't have to worry
   about the toothpicks rolling around.  This idea might not work well for
   all classes.  Use your judgement.  I know there were a couple of my
   classes that I would have never attempted this with.
   [WordWorkToothpicks.jpg]
   I found an idea for paint writing on Pinterest and loved it! The idea
   was pinned from Scribble Doodle and Draw's Blog.  You can read the post
   with this idea here.  It looked like a lot of fun and the best part was
   you only needed four items. You will need a quart size freezer Ziploc
   (freezer bags are more durable), paint, a Q-tip and tape.  Squirt some
   paint into the Ziploc and reseal it.  Be sure to squeeze the air out.
   Tape the bag shut...I didn't do this for my picture, but I plan to
   tape it shut with blue duck tape before Madalyn uses it.  After it is
   taped shut you can begin to write, draw, etc on the bag with a Q-tip.
   I think this will be lots of fun for students.  You could use this to
   practice letters, sight words, spelling words, shapes, numbers, etc.
   It's a versatile tool for the classroom...and it's fun!
   [WordWorkPaintInBag.jpg]
   Pipe cleaners (or chenille stems....that sounds so funny to me) are
   another great tool for the classroom.  You can put several in a basket
   and you have a ready made center.  Students can bend the pipe cleaners
   to form letters and spell words.  You can even extend it and have two
   colors for students to use.  They can use one color for vowels and
   another for consonants.  If you are unable to use the toothpick idea
   above you could use pipe cleaners instead.  Just cut them to the length
   of a toothpick and remind students not to bend them.
   [WordWorkPipeCleaners.jpg]
   My next idea is one I can't wait to try in the fall.  It's a variation
   of a number order activity I found for Madalyn on Pinterest last
   summer.  The number order idea came from the Tot School website.  You
   can read the number order post here.  Madalyn loved this idea, maybe
   because it combined craft sticks and Play-doh!  I had her order numbers
   1-20.  While she was working on ordering the numbers I came up with two
   more ideas.  I thought ordering the alphabet and using letters to spell
   words would be fun activities as well.  I decided to have one color for
   vowels and another for consonants.  I just used a marker to color the
   craft sticks in the picture.  I am adding colored craft sticks to my
   ever growing "To Buy Before Fall" list.  Seeing the two colors in their
   words will help them understand the importance of vowels and see
   patterns in their words.
   [WordWorkCraftStickLetters.jpg]
   My last idea is another easy and fun one that students enjoy.  Are you
   seeing a pattern here?  Easy...fun....students enjoy it...  Writing in
   the sand is so fun and relaxing.  Students really like it.  To make one
   sand writing box will need a plastic pencil box, colored sand, and a
   pencil.  It's really easy.  The most expensive thing is the colored
   sand, but if you use a coupon at a craft store it's not too costly.
   Just fill the bottom of the pencil box with sand.  You want enough in
   there so that the student can easily write the word and not scratch the
   bottom of the pencil box.  Add a pencil and the words cards and you are
   ready to have fun!  Below is the one that I made for Madalyn to
   practice her words.  We had fun the day I made it.  She wanted to see
   how long of a word we would have room to write, so we kept trying
   different words.  She also liked drawing in it.
   [WordWorkSandWriting.jpg]
   I hope you enjoy these center ideas!

Spelling/Sight Word Practice Part 2

   My favorite kindergartner and I had some fun this weekend taking
   pictures of some of the spelling centers I have used in my classroom
   over the years.  She just started spelling in her kindergarten class a
   couple weeks ago.  I wanted to show her some of the ways she could
   practice her spelling words at home.  In my classroom I would have a
   different activity in the spelling center for each day of the week.  My
   reading centers were typically four days a week. The fifth day was
   used for assessment and then I would let the students have a free
   choice of centers for review during the remainder of our reading
   block.
   Weekly Activities for the Spelling Center:
     * Monday-Introduction of words, write 3 times each on white boards,
       sometimes I would have them pyramid write them
     * Tuesday-Rainbow write the words
     * Wednesday- *This is the day that I would rotate activities every
       couple of weeks to keep things fresh

     * Spaghetti Spelling (More on this in Part 3)
     * Stamp a Word (Eeeeek!  This one would always be messy and drive me
       crazy!  Any tips on making this center less stressful for me???)
     * PomPom Spelling
     * Letter Tiles (So noisy!  I found a great and FREE alternative for
       this one.)

     Thursday- Play-Doh Spelling...My students LIVED for this one!

     Friday-Free choice after assessments

                               PomPom Spelling



    This was an easy and fun way for students to practice their words.  I
   would have a large Ziploc or basket filled with multi-colored PomPoms.
    You could even change the colors out to match the various seasons or
    holidays.  I would have index cards with the weekly spelling or sight
   words written on them.  They would choose a word and spell it out using
    the PomPoms.  It was easy and the kids had lots of fun learning their
                                   words.



                                     ﻿

   [WordWorkPomPoms.jpg]


   Letter Tiles...New and Improved....For FREE!

   My school library has bins of plastic letter tiles that you can check
   out to use during the school year.  Each year I would check them out
   and use them, but they were SO NOISY!  My students would dump them on
   the table, which would make a loud crash.  Then it seemed like they
   kept moving them around and around, making more noise.   I found a MUCH
   quieter and FREE solution!  I started cutting the large letters off
   of boxes.  Cereal boxes, frozen food items, granola bars, fruit snacks,
   soda, drink boxes, etc.  So easy and it's FREE!  Before I put boxes in
   the recycle bin I cut off any letters I can use.  I store them in a
   plastic dish in a kitchen [DEL: junk :DEL] drawer.

   [WordWorkLetterDish.jpg]

   Students will use them the same way as the plastic letter tiles.  They
   will choose a word card and spell it out using the letters.

   [WordWorkLetters.jpg]


   Play-Doh Spelling

   This was always a favorite with my students.  They would pick one of
   their spelling words and roll Play-Doh snakes.  They would then use the
   "snakes" to form letters to practice spelling their words.  Simple and
   easy.  I would have them do this activity at one of the students
   tables.  After centers were finished for the day I would have members
   of my "Tidy Team" (two students selected that week to help clean up)
   clean the table with baby wipes.
   [WordWorkPlayDoh.jpg]



   I hope you enjoyed some of my spelling center ideas.  If you have any
   questions, please let me know.  I will have a Spelling/Sight Word Part
   3 soon where I will explain "Spaghetti Spelling" and a few new ideas I
   have found while on maternity leave.  ﻿

Valentine's Day/Lunchbox Notes

   Hi Mom.....if you are reading today.  I love you!!!!
   Today is Valentine's Day.  I planned a special breakfast for Mike and
   Madalyn.  Luke was still snoozing away in his crib.  I made heart
   shaped pancakes and bacon.  I try to always set the table the night
   before to make it easier in the morning.

   [ValentineBreakfastSetUp.jpg]

   I guess I should have turned the light on before taking the picture.
   =)


   [ValentineBreakfastHeartPancakes.jpg]

   My heart pancake on the griddle.  A little abstract, but so much easier
   than using a cookie cutter!

   [ValentineBreakfastPancakeBottle.jpg]

   I used this awesome, BIG squirt bottle my Mom bought for me at Chef's
   Warehouse.

   [ValentineBreakfastMorning.jpg]

   Two of my Valentines enjoying their breakfast.  Luke had his later.
   [ValentineLunchHeartSandwich.jpg]

   I packed Madalyn a special heart shaped fluffernutter sandwich (peanut
   butter and fluff).
   [ValentineLunchSandwichBefore.jpg]

   I just made the sandwich like I usually do and used a large cookie
   cutter to cut it out.  Easy and she loved it!

   [ValentineLunchLunchBoxNotes.jpg]
   This week I have also been adding special Valentine lunch notes in
   Madalyn and Mike's lunchbox.  I usually add lunch notes but these were
   extra special.  I found them and downloaded them a couple years ago.
   You can find them here.  I also write a little note on the back.
   Madalyn likes reading hers since she is a reading machine now days.
   I hope you had a special Valentine's Day!
   Check back soon.  I'm going to be posting more spelling and sight word
   practice ideas.
