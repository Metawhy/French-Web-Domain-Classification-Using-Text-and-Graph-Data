I hate August.

   I hate August. Sorry if that sounds harsh, but I do. If you have talked
   to me in the last thirty-one days you have heard me say this a time or
   two {or many more}. There is no school, there are no activities
   involving child care, therefore no break for mom. Summer's over but
   it's not, and we are over the heat. I looked at my planner the first
   week of August and wondered to myself how in the world we would make it
   through. I looked back at last year's August to see just what exactly
   we did to survive, and there it was. Babysitters. All day. Two days a
   week. Each week. So I immediately started calling on my go-to gals and
   every single one was booked {probably by a much wiser mom who knew to
   survive while she still could}. So I put on my big girl panties and
   told myself we could manage. We may have "managed," but I can tell you
   that with just a few hours left in this month I loathe so, my husband,
   my kids, and I are all counting down the minutes until September 1st.
   Because with September comes a return of routine, a return of normalcy,
   and a return of mom not constantly griping because she needs a break.
   Ha! Despite the weariness that came from these last few weeks, we did
   manage to have a little fun. Here's a quick recap of our August!
   We kicked off the month with a couples trip to Barnsley Resort with
   friends. This was our first time visiting, and I am hoping we will be
   back soon. This place is AMAZING!!! The guys golfed, fished, and shot
   skeet while the girls lounged by the pool, enjoyed the spa and even
   took a nap. Nights were spent dining on some of the best food and
   listening to B serenade us with late night guitar singalongs. Two
   nights away was just what we needed, but we certainly missed our boys!
   August also brought lots of travel for B which meant lots of one on one
   time with my little people. They certainly wear me down, but oh can
   they make me laugh and always keep me entertained. Luckily I was able
   to manage a girls staycation with friends at the Omni downtown. We were
   sipping cocktails poolside all day and then up all night for a girls
   slumber party. How I wish we could swing those once a month!
   The highlight of August has to be George starting Junior Kindergarten.
   He has been counting down the days all summer and his first day did not
   disappoint. He absolutely loves school and his uniform {especially his
   belt!}, PE and lunch in the cafeteria are his favorites. The school
   provides the food and each day I naively hope that G is broadening his
   horizons and trying new healthy foods, but each day his report is the
   same when asked what he had for lunch. "Two jelly sandwiches." Oh how I
   love that kid.
   I also cannot forget to mention the boys started soccer this month.
   Jude made the age cutoff by one week, so the Bolton bubs are on the
   same team. Highly entertaining! At the first game they passed out
   jerseys, and there was a bit of disappointment and frustration from
   Jude when he didn't get to wear the #8 shirt {8 is his favorite number
   and he is obsessed}. He also didn't understand that once the game
   started he had to leave his ball on the sidelines. I tried explaining
   they were only going to play with one ball but that didn't go over
   well. So Jude decided to just man the flag and climb trees for the rest
   of the game. He was a good sport and shook hands with the opposing team
   saying good game at the end, but I have no idea who won. G was a
   rockstar and hustled like never before! He scored one goal and was so
   aggressive! Both boys enjoyed Gatorade and then we headed to
   Chick-fil-a where there was more disappointment this time on G's end
   because we had to leave early when Jude pooped in his underwear and
   tee-teed in the indoor playground. Did I mention we're potty training?
   Did I mention I hate August?
   Playdates with friends, dates with B and a girls night at my new
   favorite restaurant remind me that I guess this month wasn't that bad
   after all. But believe me, I am ready for September and our return to
   routine. And who knows, maybe even a return to blogging. We shall see!
   **And in case you're wondering why no mention or pictures of Jude
   turning 3 on August 6th it's because we celebrated the weekend before
   since B and I were out of town. Stay tuned for a full recap and pics
   from Jude's Super Duper Cupcake Cape Party coming soon!

Twelve Months of Amos

   Oh little man! We made it one year! Of course I meant to post this on
   June 30th but better late than never. This last year has been the
   craziest, fastest, longest, most fun, filled with laughter, filled with
   tears, adapting to zone defense, surviving life with three kids three
   and under, traveling more than ever, starting a business, learning a
   lot and loving even more! Each and everyday you managed to smile and go
   with the flow. You have brought so much joy into our lives. You are the
   best baby, the happiest little guy, and I am beyond thankful God
   blessed our family with you! Happiest birthday wishes my sweet Amos!!

Scenes from our Easter weekend...

   What an Easter weekend! We spent one night in the ER and had a power
   outage on Sunday. Despite all that craziness it still managed to be a
   fantastic weekend with our little family. I'll fill you all in on the
   details of our ER visit for Amos in another post but luckily he is
   doing just fine!
   So despite being exhausted Saturday morning after getting home from the
   hospital at 3:00, we managed to rally and make it to the egg hunt at
   church. My boys were much more interested in riding horses than hunting
   eggs! They had a ball and the weather could not have been more perfect.
   Decided to dine al fresco with some burritos afterward. Dining out with
   our circus is always entertaining so I'm thankful when we can do it
   outside. Needless to say long naps were in all our plans that
   afternoon! Takeout, DVR and wine were just what the doctor ordered for
   this tired mama that night.
   Unfortunately I was too whipped to play Easter bunny that night but
   managed to get up in time before my crew to set out all the goodies.
   I'm such a sucker for holiday fun! We raced to get everyone dressed and
   ready for church despite the copious amounts of sugar already consumed
   prior to 9:00am. Made it to church in time for the worship and was in
   awe of the music and worship experience. Easter is my favorite holiday
   I think because I am overwhelmed by the resurrection and love displayed
   by our Savior. Such a powerful message and thankful we were able to
   experience it with some of our best friends.
   Afterward we headed to my friend's gracious mother's home for a brunch
   and egg hunt. She was so sweet to hide nearly one hundred eggs for my
   three boys and my friends' three girls. The kids had a blast and we
   were able to sit on the porch, sip mimosas and savor their excitement.
   I was feeling on cloud nine when we left, so thankful for such a
   wonderful morning, but arrived home to discover we were without power.
   Fast forward several hours, no naps and drive-thru dinner at Sonic, the
   power came back on just as we were getting ready to make candlelit
   Peeps s'mores! B and I decided to put our jelly bean monsters to bed
   instead and settled in for some more wine and DVR just the two of us.
   It may have been crazy, scary and hectic at times, but it really was my
   favorite weekend. Here's hoping your Easter was special as well!
