Download VirtualBox

   Here you will find links to VirtualBox binaries and its source code.

VirtualBox binaries

   By downloading, you agree to the terms and conditions of the respective
   license.

   If you're looking for the latest VirtualBox 5.2 packages, see
   VirtualBox 5.2 builds. Please also use version 5.2 if you still need
   support for 32-bit hosts, as this has been discontinued in 6.0. Version
   5.2 will remain supported until July 2020.

VirtualBox 6.0.12 platform packages

     *  Windows hosts
     *  OS X hosts
     * Linux distributions
     *  Solaris hosts

   The binaries are released under the terms of the GPL version 2.

   See the changelog for what has changed.

   You might want to compare the checksums to verify the integrity of
   downloaded packages. The SHA256 checksums should be favored as the MD5
   algorithm must be treated as insecure!
     * SHA256 checksums, MD5 checksums

   Note: After upgrading VirtualBox it is recommended to upgrade the guest
   additions as well.

VirtualBox 6.0.12 Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack

     *  All supported platforms

   Support for USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 devices, VirtualBox RDP, disk
   encryption, NVMe and PXE boot for Intel cards. See this chapter from
   the User Manual for an introduction to this Extension Pack. The
   Extension Pack binaries are released under the VirtualBox Personal Use
   and Evaluation License (PUEL). Please install the same version
   extension pack as your installed version of VirtualBox.

VirtualBox 6.0.12 Software Developer Kit (SDK)

     *  All platforms

User Manual

   The VirtualBox User Manual is included in the VirtualBox packages
   above. If, however, you would like to take a look at it without having
   to install the whole thing, you also access it here:

     *  User Manual (HTML version)

   You may also like to take a look at our frequently asked questions
   list.

VirtualBox older builds

   The binaries in this section for VirtualBox before version 4.0 are all
   released under the VirtualBox Personal Use and Evaluation License
   (PUEL). As of VirtualBox 4.0, the Extension Pack is released under the
   VirtualBox Personal Use and Evaluation License and the other packages
   are released under the terms of the GPL version 2. By downloading, you
   agree to the terms and conditions of the respective license.
