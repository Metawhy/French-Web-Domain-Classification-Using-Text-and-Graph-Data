Tricky Letter Activities for Halloween

   by Angela Thayer Leave a Comment

   Learning the alphabet can be easy for some kids, but more challenging
   for others. The English alphabet comprises forty different shapes and
   that’s a lot for kids to learn! Some letters have multiple sounds, are
   harder to recognize or learn to write and need more time on it. Most
   kids can recognize O, B, X, and A, but when it comes to lowercase
   letters b and d, it’s more challenging. Today I'm sharing a resource
   for teaching tricky letters. It's also a fun activity for Halloween!

Fall Scavenger Hunt

   by Angela Thayer Leave a Comment
   fall scavenger hunt

   A fun way to celebrate fall is to go on a fall scavenger hunt. It's a
   good way to soak in the sights, smells, and sounds of fall. It also
   helps you slow down and appreciate the season. It's my favorite season
   of all but always seems to go by too quickly. This printable is
   designed to use three senses: eyes for sight, nose for smell, and ears
   for hearing. The first page is all about sight. The goal is to find all
   10 items as you go for a walk or look around your neighborhood. The …

Why Letter of the Week Curriculum Isn’t Effective

   Why letter of the week curriculum is not effective

   Disclosure: This post contains affiliate links to Amazon. For more
   information, please see my disclosure. Do you use Letter of the Week
   curriculum? I've used it in the past and while it does have some
   benefits, it's not my first choice. The concept is great...children
   will learn a letter every week and then at the end of 26 weeks, they
   will know all the alphabet letters! But the reality is, most children
   aren't going to magically know the alphabet letters after 26 weeks. In
   my opinion, … [Read more...]

Our Homeschool Room for 2019

   by Angela Thayer 1 Comment
   homeschool room

   I'm excited to share that we've decided to homeschool our boys this
   year! We did preschool at home but then decided to send our kids to our
   local school. We loved the school and teachers, but because of my
   husband's non-traditional work schedule, the school schedule made it
   hard for the boys to see their dad. Family life is super important to
   us, so we thought homeschooling would be a great option. We are excited
   for the year ahead as we will have a 2nd grader and 4th grader. Our
   youngest … [Read more...]
