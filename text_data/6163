Effective Date: 14th of August 2019

   PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS (“Game”) is a game developed by PUBG
   CORPORATION (“Company”). PUBG CORPORATION is an affiliated company of
   KRAFTON, INC. and the Company provides game services, official website
   (https://www.pubg.com), and other game related services (Collectively,
   “Service”). The Company complies with all applicable laws related to
   personal information and the Company strives to protect the rights of
   individual users by adopting Privacy Policy in accordance with relevant
   laws and regulations. The Company is the data controller of your

   that would allow someone to identify or contact you, including, for
   example, your full name, address, telephone number, or email address.
   Personal Information does not include aggregated information that, by
   itself, does not permit the identification of individual persons (like
   statistics about how many persons visited the Site last month, or how
   many visitors are male and how many are female).

       of our legitimate interests are to use website user and visitor

       continuously improve our Service, we suggest offers we think might
       interest you, and we process information for administrative, fraud
       detection and other legal purposes.
     * the processing is necessary for us to comply with a relevant legal

     * you have consented to the processing: From time to time, we may ask
       for your consent to use your information for certain specific
       reasons. You may withdraw your consent at any time without
       affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its

   applicable national laws, the Company may give permission to third
   parties, including service providers which process personal information
