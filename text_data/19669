Homeschooling

   By Natalia on April 20, 2018 in Family, Homeschool 6

   So homeschooling. It’s all the rage, right? Well, since I’m all about
   being trendy (eye roll) we jumped on that band wagon!

   Well, no, that’s not actually how it worked out. Some of you expressed
   interest, so I thought I’d write about it!

   I know a lot of people have strong opinions about homeschooling, and
   that’s okay. We’re all entitled to our own thoughts. I’m just here to
   share our story and what has and hasn’t worked for us!

   Now, you know there are those type A personalities, everything is done
   well in advance and super organized and well- planned? A lot of thought
   goes into everything and things run relatively smoothly? I’m not that
   person. In fact, I am the opposite. Is there a Type Z personality?
   Because that’s what I’d be.

   I am an under-thinker, non-planner, ‘eh, it’ll work out!’ kind of
   person. This can have it’s negative effects and can be helpful at
   times. I don’t worry much, but I don’t think too much about things. I’m
   go-with-the-flow and life generally works out. I have a relatively low
   stress level, and not a lot rattles me. However, the non-planner thing
   does not bode well for me. I have to work hard at being planned and
   organized and have to constantly work to manage our lives well. It’s a
   struggle for sure.

   All that to say, people generally research homeschooling and think
   about it a lot before hand. Me? We decided at the end of July that we
   were gonna jump in. To be honest, this worked perfectly for me. Had I
   tried to plan it for 2 years in advance, I probably would have had the
   same outcome. There’s only so much you can do before you start
   something completely unknown.

   I know, Type A personalities everywhere are breaking into sweats.
   Sorry.

Reasons we decided to start homeschooling

   why we homeschool

   I am sure that everyone has their own reasons for their kids’
   education, I’m just merely sharing ours. I am a firm believer that
   there are multiple ways to raise children, not one correct one.
   Different things work for different families, and we all just have to
   do our best!

My Husband’s Schedule

   fire station

   As a fireman, his schedule is weird and it varies. I rarely know his
   schedule and it’s hard to make plans around him. Sometimes he’ll work
   through the weekend but be home 3 days in a row during the week. If the
   kids were in regular school, with our super busy evenings, he would
   never see them! This way, we can do work on our own time, when it works
   for us, and have hang out time with dad when he has his days off. It’s
   awesome.

Education

   Yes, I realize you can have intelligent, good kids in the public and
   private systems, but for us, nothing beats one-on-one, being able to
   push your kids. My older son is taking a very high level English class
   (I’m learning so much!) and my younger son has moved up a grade level
   in math. It’s awesome to go at your own pace and push where you see
   they can be pushed.

Know your kids

   I have a very talkative kid and a very quiet kid. With the talkative
   one I was always very aware what was happening at school, because he
   would recount every aspect of it as soon as he hit the car. The quiet
   one never could get a word in edgewise, so I didn’t really know what
   was going on in his classroom. With them home, I know what they’re
   doing, I know their level, and I can push and pull back as needed. I
   had no idea that my younger son was a math-minded kid. It just clicks
   in a way I haven’t seen it click for my older guy and he’s already a
   grade level higher. My older son struggles in math and we’ve had to do
   extra to make sure that he is keeping up and understanding it. But he
   excels at English and speaking in front of people.

   Being able to have them home has helped me identify better their
   strengths and weaknesses. I can help them in areas that they struggle
   in and let them soar in areas that are easier for them. I love that!

Time with them

   The other day I said to my husband that we only have 10 more years with
   them home. TEN. The first 10 flew by, so I imagine the second 10 will
   too! I love being with them, hanging out, learning together. I want to
   be around, I want to cherish these moments. Like I mentioned, with my
   husband’s schedule, it’s easier for us to have family time when we can
   do it when we want.

Teach what we want

   After leaving France, we have tried so hard to keep up with French.
   However, after a full day of school and an hour of homework, I did not
   have willing students to add another 20 minutes of French! They wanted
   to play and I wanted to let them! Now we just add in French into our
   curriculum. They learn a little Latin as well through our co-op,
   Classical Conversations. We do devotions together in the morning. We
   memorize verses together and have added art and music.

Sleep

   I don’t know about you, but my kids need a lot of sleep. They’re huge,
   so that could be why, but they need sleep. My older son could sleep for
   a whole 12 hours! They also have evening athletics which keep them up
   later than I’d want, so it’s nice to not have to get up at 6:30. They
   wake up by 8 to get started for school. And trust me, they need it!

Influence

   This is not really high on my list, but I think I should mention it all
   the same. Public school can have some nasty influences, and why not
   keep my kids from them as long as I can? I don’t want them living in a
   bubble, but I’m also okay if they aren’t exposed to stuff younger than
   they need to be. Some of my older sons’ (he’s 11) best friends are
   girls and it’s not weird at all. If there are crushes going on, no one
   talks about it and no one makes it weird. It’s a line my husband and I
   are constantly trying to walk — exposing them enough to the world to
   not have them ignorant or naive, but also keeping them innocent as long
   as we can.

Travel

   Y’all know I love to travel. And while we don’t get to do it as much
   now-a-days, I still like to think it could happen at a moments notice!
   My older son went to Spain a couple weeks ago to play in an
   international basketball tournament. He took two weeks for spring break
   and I didn’t have to get extra homework, talk to teachers or worry
   about getting that letter from the schools saying we’ve missed too much
   school. I’ve gotten one each year in public school, only for traveling
   since we rarely get sick. Now, I just make sure he is on point or ahead
   and start school back when we’re ready!

Freedom

   Gosh, I love it. This morning, for example, my friend who also
   homeschools, needed someone to watch her kids while she went to the
   dentist. So I watched them, the kids played for a couple hours, they
   left and now my kids are doing school. It’s in the afternoon, which we
   usually don’t do, but they got good play time in the morning. We do
   what we want, when we want, how we want, and gosh darn it, I love it.
   Lest you start criticizing me on not doing enough school, we obviously
   put that first and work around it, but we make our own schedule and I
   love that.

   So there you have it, most of our reasons for homeschooling! Let me
   just add a disclaiming and say, like I mentioned before, that I don’t
   think that these things can’t be done while your kids are in a public
   or private school. A lot of families do it and are very successful at
   it. Our boys were in public schools, here and in France, for 8 and 5
   years before we pulled them out. So if you guys are doing whatever
   you’re doing and it’s working – stick with it! Things work differently
   for different people! I am for sure not here to say everyone should be
   homeschooling, I am well aware it’s not for everyone.

Negative Aspects of Homeschooling

   That being said, there are negative aspects. I couldn’t write a
   homeschooling post without writing about those as well!

They’re always there. Always.

   They never leave. They’re always there. Asking questions, eating
   snacks, leaving messes. There are no breaks. Kids can be annoying and I
   will be the first to admit I lose my mind every once in a while.
   Thankfully, I have a husband who values my sanity (it’s in his best
   interest to do so!) and he helps when I need him and when he can. We
   also have a pretty solid community and we moms help each other out. And
   honestly, surprisingly, I have found that mostly, I’m okay. I had a
   rough patch in February, but besides that, I’ve mostly enjoyed them!
   Granted, I only have two kids, but it’s been mostly fun.

Social aspect

   I know this is one of people’s biggest criticisms, and I get it.
   Homeschoolers have to work a little harder to socialize their kids. But
   like I mentioned, we’re a part of a co-op where we meet once a week and
   the boys love it. We also have a strong community, so they see those
   friends a lot too. And for our family personally, they’re involved in a
   lot of sports, church and outside activities, so they get a lot of
   interaction with other kids and adults. We also travel a lot and our
   kids have already been exposed to more cultures than some adults. I
   think they’ll be okay.

   All in all, for us, the positive definitely outweighs the negative. It
   has worked well for us this year and we plan to continue next year and
   take it year by year. We are not necessarily lifers – committed for the
   rest of their academic career until college, but we are open to all
   options!

   I know this got long, but it’s a little insight into our world. Would
   you like to hear more about homeschooling? How we do it, what we use,
   our school room, schedules or anything like that? Leave it in the
   comments if you do!

   Please remember, this is our personal choice and opinions! I am well
   aware, good kids can be raised all kinds of ways! My husband was public
   school all the way through and he is the best man I know. I went to
   private school and leave a little to be desired… Let’s all just commit
   to doing what’s best with our family!
