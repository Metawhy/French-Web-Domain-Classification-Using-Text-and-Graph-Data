I HAVE MOVED!

   Hello everyone,
   Thanks for visiting my blog. I have moved from here to another place.
   My new blog is called Handmadebyg3.com
   It is still in the set up stage. I am new to self hosting stuff and
   learning my way into it. Any help from anyone is gold to me right now.
   My new blog is basic and changing at the moment. So please bear with
   me. Hoping all will be good soon.
   Thanks for your patience. Make sure you follow my new blog.

Adding colour and texture to your cards. Photo Heavy!

   Oh Hi everyone,
   Hope you are looking forward to your weekend or already enjoying your
   Saturday. I shared with you on my social media the panels I created
   using the new distress oxide inks. They are so pretty I will tell you.
   The oxide chalky look and feel is amazing. I played with the inks an
   entire afternoon.
   One of the techniques I tried was the traditional Tim's technique of
   applying inks to the mat, spritzing with water and smooshing the
   watercolour panel on it. Then I sprayed more water and heat set. I
   repeated this process to add layers. I love this technique. But I felt
   I did not get the intense colours on this technique and also I kind
   didn't have control over the spatters, colours and the oxidation of the
   inks. I like bright colours, love spatters and also like to have a bit
   of control on what I am doing. So instead, I sponged the inks on the
   watercolour panel randomly first. This gives me control of how intense
   the colour I like and where on the paper. Hope this makes sense. Then I
   spattered clean water in small drops first, heat set them and then
   added more water in puddles, heat set.... repeated this process until I
   was happy. I had control over where I wanted the oxidation and keeping
   intense colours in some places to give a nice variation to the
   background.
   [distress%2Boxide.jpg]
   The panel on the far left is using the traditional technique and the
   middle and right panels are using sponging and spatter technique. You
   can see the difference. I have used the texture side of the Tim Holtz
   distress watercolor paper. This is one way to add texture and of course
   you have the spatters and layers to add texture.  You can use them as
   is for a background as they are beautiful. I die cut these using Simon
   Says Stamp Tropical Leaves die set to die cut the panel out. I made a
   set of four cards. Two using white as the base and two using kraft as
   the base. Here they are.
   You are the sweetest card1
   I actually made another colourful panel similar to the centre panel and
   die cut lots of these tropical leaves. For this card, I die cut a white
   panel using one of the rectangle dies from Infinity rectangle die set
   from HA. I adhered the die cut randomly on the panel, trimmed off the
   excess, adhered the panel to the white card base using foam adhesives.
   The sentiment is from Simon Says Stamp Sweet Cakes stamp set. I added
   some sequins to finish the card. Here is a closeup.
   You are the sweetest closeup
   Second card the panel is larger than the first card. The process is the
   same. The sentiment is from Friendly Flowers stamp set. The Distress
   Oxide ink colours I have used are Broken China, Spiced Marmalade and
   Worn Lipstick
   Thinking of you card
   Here is the closeup of the card.
   Thinking of you closeup
   I used the other two panels I created using distress oxide inks on
   kraft base as the colours were muted.
   keep Smiling card1
   This Distress Oxide panel was created using the traditional technique I
   mentioned above. You can see in the closeup the layers of colours, some
   colours blended over the other especially the areas of green since I
   used Broken China and Fossilized Amber distress oxide inks only. This
   technique will be great for backgrounds. The sentiment is from Simon
   Says Stamp Thinking of You stamp set.
   Keep Smiling closeup
   On this panel below, I have used Distress Oxides Peeled Paint, Fired
   Brick and Fossilized Amber. I sponged them randomly on Tim Holtz
   distress watercolor paper, spatter water and heat set. Repeated the
   process many times till I was happy with the result. The die cut the
   panel using Tropical leaves dies from Simon Says Stamp. Same process as
   the previous cards.
   You matter very much card1
   The sentiment is from Friendly Flowers stamp set also from Simon Says
   Stamp.
   You matter very much closeup
   Here are supplies I used to make these cards.

Simon Says A Bit O' Green!

   [wed-newchallenge-header.png]

   Hi all and welcome to another week on the Simon Says Stamp Wednesday
   Challenge
   Thank you for joining us for the Feminine Challenge and we hope you
   will all join us again this week too.
   We will be back soon with the name of the lucky winner of the $50
   Voucher
   This week the challenge is to use a

Bit O’ Green

   In honour of St Patricks day on 17th March
   This week we are showcasing Taylored Expressions Products this
   week. You don’t have to use them for the challenge but if you have them
   we would love to see them used.
   As always Simon Says Stamp will be giving away $50 voucher to shop at
   the fabulous Simon Says Stamp Store.
   [50dollar_voucher_600px%2B%25281%2529.jpg]
   There are all the colours of the rainbow on my card along with a bit of
   green. I followed the challenge title to the T!  Taylored Expressions
   dies are one of my favourite. They are unique and you can combine their
   dies to create a scene as they all coordinate well with each other.
   That is what I have done with my card.
   SSS A bit of Green!
   I have used On the Line Beach die set along with Little Bits Adirondack
   Chair, Little Bits: Sun and Clouds and Skinny Mini Borders Spring dies
   to create my scene. And to add colours to my elements, I have used the
   new Distress Oxide inks.
   For my background, I sponged Fossilzed Amber, Broken China and Faded
   Jeans distress oxide inks,  added water spatter and heat set to get
   that chalky look to the oxide. On an another bristol paper, I sponged
   Peeled Paint and Vintage Photo distress oxide inks, spattered with
   water, heat set before using the On the line Beach die to die cut the
   palm trees. I also die cut four of the stitched detail leaves of the
   palm tree which I layered one behind and one on top of the base trees.
   I adhered this on the background using foam adhesives.
   I similarly repeated the process of distress inks to die cut all the
   other elements for the card. Only the clouds don't have any colour on
   them. The sentiment is from Simon Says Stamp Pool Play stamp set
   stamped using black ink and MISTI. Finally the card is embellished with
   Snow Flurries sequins.
   Here are couple of closeups photos of the card.

Hip Hip Meh.....

   Hey everyone,
   A  quick post sharing a Grouchy Grumpling card using the new Grouchy
   Grumplings 2 stamp set from Taylored Expressions.
   [GrouchyGrumplings2-267683465.jpg] [thumbnail%2B%25281%2529.jpg]
   GAYATRIGrouchygrumplings2TUE1
   I coloured the hippo from Grouchy Grumplings 2 stamp set using copic
   markers and die cut the image using the coordinating die. For the
   background I sponged the background stitched rectangle panel with
   distress inks Ripe Persimmon, Fossilized Amber and Candied Apple. I
   stamped the star background from Matchy Backgrounds stamp set using
   Candied Apple distress ink. The image is adhered using foam adhesive on
   the left side of the panel. One sentiment is heat embossed on Poppy
   Seed strip of cardstock and the second sentiment is black heat embossed
   below the focal panel. The card is embellished with Oreo enamel shapes
   from Taylored Expressions. Here is  a closeup of the card.
