Welcome to RepRap.org

   RepRap is humanity's first general-purpose self-replicating
   manufacturing machine.

   RepRap takes the form of a free desktop 3D printer capable of printing
   plastic objects. Since many parts of RepRap are made from plastic and
   RepRap prints those parts, RepRap self-replicates by making a kit of
   itself - a kit that anyone can assemble given time and materials. It
   also means that - if you've got a RepRap - you can print lots of useful
   stuff, and you can print another RepRap for a friend...

   RepRap is about making self-replicating machines, and making them
   freely available for the benefit of everyone. We are using 3D printing
   to do this, but if you have other technologies that can copy themselves
   and that can be made freely available to all, then this is the place
   for you too.

   Reprap.org is a community project, which means you are welcome to edit
   most pages on this site, or better yet, create new pages of your own.
   Our community portal and New Development pages have more information on
   how to get involved. Use the links below and on the left to explore the
   site contents. You'll find some content translated into other
   languages.

   RepRap was the first of the low-cost 3D printers, and the RepRap
   Project started the open-source 3D printer revolution. It has become
   the most widely-used 3D printer among the global members of the Maker
   Community.

   RepRap was voted the most significant 3D-printed object in 2017. That
   is to say people think that the most important thing you can print in a
   3D printer is another 3D printer - the whole reason for the RepRap
   project. Also in 2017 RepRap's creator Adrian Bowyer was awarded the 3D
   Printing Industry's Outstanding Contribution to 3D Printing Award and
   was inducted into the 3D Printing Hall of Fame. In 2019 Adrian was
   awarded an MBE by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II for RepRap.

   RepRap state-of-the-art when this page was last updated (March 2019) is
   well represented by John Mulac's Mulbot (also available here).
