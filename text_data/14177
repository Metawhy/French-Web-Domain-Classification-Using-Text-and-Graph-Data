Velvet Ants

   ENTFACT-442: Velvet Ants  |  Download PDF

by Ric Bessin, Extension Entomologist
University of Kentucky College of Agriculture

   One unusual insect that is occasionally seen running around open areas
   in the yard during July, August, and September is the velvet ant.
   Velvet ants look like large hairy ants, but they are actually wasps.
   They differ from ants in having only a slight constriction between the
   thorax and abdomen and having straight rather than elbowed antennae.
   They may be seen in lawns or pastures, or occasionally wandering into
   buildings. These solitary wasps, as the name implies, are densely
   covered with short hair.

   The males have two pairs of transparent black wings. The females are
   wingless, and are sometimes confused with ants. Ants, however, have
   elbowed antennae, and a "hump" in the constriction between the thorax
   and abdomen. Velvet ants are brightly colored. They are shades of
   yellow and brown or red and black. Velvet ants are not aggressive and
   will try to escape when encountered, but females have a very painful
   sting if handled. Females use a long, needle-like stinger concealed at
   the tip of the abdomen. Many of the velvet ants can produce a squeaking
   sound when disturbed.

   Adult velvet ants feed on nectar and water. The immature stages are
   external parasites of bees and wasps that nest in the ground. A few
   species parasitize some flies and beetles. Consequently, there are no
   identifiable nests to treat. Velvet ants prefer pastures and fields
   with sandy soil where their prey are most likely to be found. There is
   no effective control measure for them. If they are particularly
   abundant in an area, it may be helpful in the long run to overseed to
   get a better grass cover. This would discourage the ground nesting bees
   and wasps on which velvet ants feed. Because velvet ants are uncommon
   and do not cause any damage, no chemical control is recommended.

   One velvet ant that is commonly submitted for identification is the
   ‘cow killer.’ The cow killer is the largest of the velvet ants in
   Kentucky, nearly an inch in length. It earned its name by the
   reputation of the female’s sting. It is said that the sting is so
   painful that it could kill a cow.

   The female is mostly red with some black, the male is half red and half
   black with dark wings. Females seek out bumble bee nests and lay eggs
   inside the wax cups. After bees or wasps have formed cocoons, adult
   female velvet ants enter the host nest by digging through the soil or
   breaking through nest walls. The cow killer larvae feed on the bumble
   bee larvae and pupae and will pupate inside the bumble bee nest. This
   bumble bee is ultimately killed.
