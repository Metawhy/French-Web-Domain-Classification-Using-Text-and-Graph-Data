Good Bye Holy Family

   To Holy Family Parish:
   Words are inadequate to capture my emotions from last Sunday. Thank you
   for your kind words and generous cards and gifts. I am feeling
   overwhelmed by your generosity! Thank you to all who made the party
   possible, including Lydia, Catherine Baldassare, Sylvia Stapleton, Anna
   Monaco, Denyse Hinca, the Knights of Columbus, and Garden Foods for the
   Sausages and Hamburgers. Special shout-out to the Steko Family for the
   Roasted Lamb and Piglet! (mmmm)

   By the grace of God, we have been able to do great things here at Holy
   Family. Caring for Everyone: Young and Elderly, Rich and Poor, Strong
   and Weak, Educated and Illiterate, Confident and Timid, has been
   possible because I have desired from day one to Know you, Love you and
   Serve you. I trust you will welcome Fr. Andrew in the way you welcomed
   me, and thus great things will continue to happen here at Holy
   Family! Until we meet again, I will see you at the (very crowded) Table
   of the Lord!
   Peace.
   Fr. Larry Leger, Former Pastor

Resurrection

   [Easter%2B2019.jpg]
   RESURRECTION HOMILY
   by St. John Chrysostom
   Come all lovers of God, rejoice in the splendor of this feast:
   enter into the joy of your Lord.
   You the first and you the last, receive alike your reward;
   you rich and you poor, dance together;
   you sober and you weaklings, celebrate the day;
   you who have kept the fast and you who have not, rejoice today. The
   table is richly loaded: enjoy its royal banquet…
   let no one go away hungry.
   All of you enjoy the banquet of faith;
   all of you receive the riches of his goodness.
   Christ is risen and the angels rejoice.
   Christ is risen and life is freed.
   Christ is risen and the tomb is emptied of the dead:
   for Christ, being risen from the dead,
   has become the Leader and Reviver
   of those who had fallen asleep.
   To Him be glory and power for ever and ever.
   Amen

Good Friday

   [Triduum.jpg]
   Good Friday
   Gather at the parish for the Good Friday liturgy at noon or 3:00 p.m.
   As you enter be aware of your surroundings and refrain from unnecessary
   conversation. At this liturgy we begin in silence. We proclaim the
   passion from the Gospel of St. John and we pray for the needs of the
   world. We adore the cross of Christ.
   Throughout Jesus’ life he loved those who were cast out from the
   society, showing mercy and forgiveness to those who betrayed, judged
   and persecuted him. Jesus has shown us the path to love. The path to
   love involves the cross. On this day may we be aware of who God is
   calling us to love and what cross we are carrying. Will we allow Jesus
   to carry the cross with us?

Fridays in Lent

   During the Fridays of Lent we usually abstain from meat - because
   Jesus' flesh was sacrificed on Good Friday.
   [fast%2BAbstain.jpg]
   We also speak of fasting through Lent - and yet Pope Francis
   continually reminds us that fasting need not simply be considered from
   food or drink - but in our words and actions:

Pray - Fast - Give

   Image may contain: text
   As we embark upon our Lenten journey - we embrace the 3 practices of
   lent: Prayer, Fasting and Almsgiving.
   Bishop Robert Barron had a neat reflection on Prayer this morning:

     Well, how should we pray? What does it look like? You have to pray
     with faith, and according to Jesus’ model, you have to pray with
     forgiveness. The efficacy of prayer seems to depend on the
     reconciliation of differences.You also have to pray with
     persistence. One reason that we don’t receive what we want through
     prayer is that we give up too easily. Augustine said that God
     sometimes delays in giving us what we want because he wants our
     hearts to expand.Finally, we have to pray in Jesus’ name. In doing
     so we are relying on his influence with the Father, trusting that
     the Father will listen to him.

   To Fast is not only connected to food or drink. We can fast from
   criticism, from technology, - especially from gossip, Pope Francis
   suggests. In our fasting - we are reminded that we depend completely
   upon God -for everything.
   To Give is to be a person of gratitude and at the same time imitate God
   who is the authour of life, and has given us all that we have. To give
   not simply from our abundance - but from our essence - is to be a truly
   sacrificial giver.
   Peace!

Count Down to Lent - 2019

   [pray%2Bfast%2Bgive.jpg]
   Lent is the yearly celebration by the Church of its corporate
   conversion in Jesus Christ. During Lent, the liturgy prepares
   catechumens to celebrate the Paschal Mystery by the various stages of
   Christian initiation. It also prepares the faithful for Easter as they
   recall their baptism and do penance in preparation for the greatest
   Feast of the year.
   Lent has two major purposes : I recalls or prepares for baptism, and
   emphasizes a spirit of penance. Through forty days of closer attention
   to God's Word and of more fervent prayer, believers are prepared to
   celebrate the Paschal Mystery.
   We will continue our practice of tying ribbons onto the bare branches
   in the church - each time we Pray, Fast, or Give. In this way our
   Lenten disciplines will be connected to our Sunday Worship - and our
   celebration of the great feast of Easter.
