Moved to New Location

Moved to New Location

   This project has been moved to GitHub. See:
   https://github.com/subclipse and
   https://github.com/subclipse/subclipse/wiki

   As part of moving the project it has also been split into three
   separate repositories for Subclipse, svnClientAdapter and svnAnt. Since
   this obviously involved some editing and rewriting, I also posted a
   repository named "archive" which is a more pure dump of the full
   repository content including all binary files. The open issues for
   svnClientAdapter and svnAnt were loaded into their repositories and the
   open issues for Subclipse are loaded into the archive repository.

   The discussion forums here have been closed. There is a new Google
   Group available for Subclipse and of course you can always post
   questions at StackOverflow.
