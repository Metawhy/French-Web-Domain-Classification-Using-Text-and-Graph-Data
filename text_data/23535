About

   Denver-based journalist exploring the fringes of science and culture. I
   recently wrote a non-fiction book for St. Martin’s Press called Bugged:
   The Insects Who Rule the World and the People Obsessed with Them.

   I’ve frequently contributed to WIRED for years, and have also written
   for WSJ, Vice, Medium, Los Angeles Magazine, Onion A.V. Club, Pacific
   Standard, 5280, ArsTechnica and Outside to name a few. I was also an
   editor for Boulder County’s Yellow Scene Magazine until 2014 when I
   pursued freelance writing.

   My WIRED stories cover a gamut of intrigue—from 3-D printed body
   parts, cloud speakers, bug sushi, and Darwin’s facial expressions to my
   feature story on the banana-clad madness of Decentralized Dance
   Parties.
