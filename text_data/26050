How to Hide Google Analytics UTM Parameters Using Google Tag Manager

   Google Tag ManagerMost Popular
   Last updated: October 1, 2019
   Taavi Kalvi

   Google Analytics UTM parameters are a very handy way to track your
   online marketing efforts. They’re used to capture important reporting
   data and they help you figure out which posts, banners or emails bring
   the most traffic and customers to your website.

   Although pretty much all digital marketers should be using Google
   Analytics UTM parameters, we’ve seen that many of them are still not
   doing it. There are probably a couple of reasons for this.
    1. Marketers are not aware of the benefits of using Google Analytics
       UTM parameters.
    2. There are so many different marketing channels and adding those
       parameters is sometimes forgotten.
    3. Marketers believe that the long URLs scare the users away and they
       won’t click on the links when they see the strange website URLs
       with parameters. (Pretty much make an URL less trustworthy.)

   Hide long UTM parameters

   Who would want to click on this long link? 🤔

   In the following tutorial, we will focus on the third reason and show
   you how to hide the UTM parameters with Google Tag Manager, so that you
   could still keep using them.

Why should you hide any Google Analytics UTM parameters?

   In some cases, you’d really like to track the performance of different
   links, but don’t want to attach the “ugly” UTM parameters to the end of
   the URLs. Let’s go through some of the following examples to get a
   better picture.

1. LinkedIn Profile Page

   It’s useful to know how many people click on the link on your company
   page on LinkedIn so that you can separate this traffic from the rest.
   At the same time, you probably don’t wish to see those ugly Google
   Analytics UTM parameters at the end of your company’s website address.

   Short URL, no UTM parameters

2. E-mail Sales Letter

   Would you like to be a hardcore data-driven sales person who knows
   exactly how much your specific lead knows about your business and your
   services before you make a call?

   Email UTM parameters

   If you attach the Google Analytics UTM parameters to the end of this
   website URL, you can analyze the user journey later with tools like
   Google Analytics and HotJar. After that you can know exactly what a
   specific person knows about your business and your services before you
   call her or send another email.
   But I guess that in a lot of cases, you wouldn’t want to drive your
   potential customer to an URL like this:
   https://holini.com/?utm_source=signature&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=
   Taavi

3. Facebook Profile Page

   How would you know the number of people who click on the link on your
   Facebook profile page?

   And how could you separate this traffic from the rest?

   Facebook UTM parameters

   These are just some of the quick examples from a variety of places
   where you normally wouldn’t use any UTM parameters.

How to hide the UTM parameters?

   You can use simple URL fragments and some Google Tag Manager tricks to
   hide the UTM parameters and still keep tracking different traffic
   sources with Google Analytics. For this, you can use a feature in
   Google Tag Manager, called the Lookup Table.

   This is probably the easiest way to do it.

   So how can you turn your long URLs with Google Analytics UTM parameters
   like this…

   https://holini.com/?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=
   profile+page

   … into short and sweet web links that can look something like this (and
   still track your traffic source)?

Step 1

   First of all, you need to have Google Tag Manager installed on your
   website to make this happen. If you’d like to learn more about Google
   Tag Manager, you should take a look at this amazing Google Tag Manager
   tutorial for beginners.
   While this tool allows users with even minimal technical experience to
   start creating tags, triggers and variables in a matter of minutes, the
   installation itself may require an upfront effort and close
   collaboration with your web development or IT team.

     Simo Ahava’s post called Tag Management Does Not Make IT Redundant
     pointed out 10 suggestions for making the deployment and the use of
     tag management systems more manageable for both the marketers and
     the IT department. Highly recommended reading if you’re either a
     developer or a marketer who’s taking the first steps towards
     becoming a tag management ninja.

   Bear with me. It’s not THAT difficult. We’ve got you covered!

Step 2

    1. In Google Tag Manager, go to the Variables section in the left hand
       menu.
    2. Create a new ‘User-Defined Variable’ in Google Tag Manager and for
       the ‘Variable Type’ choose: ‘URL’.  (Variables > User-Defined
       Variables > New > URL)
    3. In the configuration settings, choose the ‘Component Type’ to be
       ‘Fragment’.
    4. Give a name to your new variable that you will remember, like ‘URL
       – Fragment’.

     I recommend reading the Google Tag Manager Naming Strategies to
     Organize Your Container article written by Zee Drakhshandeh to learn
     more about the naming strategies.
    5. Here’s how it looks like in Google Tag Manager:

   URL Fragment in Tag Manager

Step 3

   Now, you’ll need to create three Lookup Table Variables in Google Tag
   Manager – one for utm_source, one for utm_medium, and one
   for utm_campaign. Then you’ll need to choose the URL fragment as the
   input variable for each of the Lookup Tables and match it with the
   values for the source, medium, and campaign that you would like to send
   to your Google Analytics property.

   A step-by-step guide

   Let’s go through an example and create a custom link for your Sales
   Letter, LinkedIn and Facebook profile pages.
   Set up a Lookup Table for different Sources
    1. Create a new ‘User-Defined Variable’ in the Google Tag Manager and
       for the ‘Variable Type’ choose: ‘Lookup Table’. (Variables >
       User-Defined Variables > New > Lookup Table)
    2. Choose the {{URL – Fragment}} as the ‘Input Value’ in the
       configuration settings.
    3. Give a name to your new variable that you will remember, like
       ‘Lookup – URL – Fragment – Source’.
    4. Now, you’ll need to choose the input variable that the Lookup Table
       will reference to match the appropriate value
          + If the fragment of the page URL is agency, then return the
            respective ‘Output’ – linkedin
          + If the fragment of the page URL is 1, then return the
            respective ‘Output’ – signature
          + If the fragment of the page URL is services, then return the
            respective ‘Output’ – facebook

   Lookup Table - Source

   Set up a Lookup Table for different Mediums
    1. Create a new ‘User-Defined Variable’ in the Google Tag Manager and
       for the ‘Variable Type’ choose: ‘Lookup Table’. (Variables >
       User-Defined Variables > New > Lookup Table)
    2. Choose the {{URL – Fragment}} as the ‘Input Value’ in the
       configuration settings.
    3. Give a name to your new variable that you will remember, like
       ‘Lookup – URL – Fragment – Medium’.
    4. Now, you’ll need to choose the input variable that the Lookup Table
       will reference to match the appropriate value:
          + If the fragment of the page URL is agency, then return the
            respective ‘Output’ – social
          + If the fragment of the page URL is 1, then return the
            respective ‘Output’ – email
          + If the fragment of the page URL is services, then return the
            respective ‘Output’ – social

   Lookup Table - Medium

   Set up a Lookup Table for different Campaign Names
    1. Create a new ‘User-Defined Variable’ in the Google Tag Manager and
       for the ‘Variable Type’ choose: ‘Lookup Table’. (Variables >
       User-Defined Variables > New > Lookup Table)
    2. Choose the {{URL – Fragment}} as the ‘Input Value’ in the
       configuration settings.
    3. Give a name to your new variable that you will remember, like
       ‘Lookup – URL – Fragment – Campaign Name’.
    4. Now, you’ll need to choose the input variable that the Lookup Table
       will reference to match the appropriate value:
          + If the fragment of the page URL is agency, then return the
            respective ‘Output’ – profile page
          + If the fragment of the page URL is 1, then return the
            respective ‘Output’– Taavi
          + If the fragment of the page URL is services, then return the
            respective ‘Output’ – profile page

   Lookup Table - Campaign

Step 4

   The final setup piece is to send the output of your Lookup Tables into
   Google Analytics. You can use your generic Universal Analytics Page
   View tag that is already set up in Google Tag Manager.
    1. Open your Google Analytics ‘Page View’ tag.
    2. Expand the ‘More settings’ menu, then the ‘Fields to Set’ menu, and
       click ‘+Add Field’.
    3. Enter the following three ‘Field Names’ with the values of the
       three corresponding Lookup Tables:
          + campaignSource – {{Lookup – URL – Fragment – Source}}
          + campaignMedium – {{Lookup – URL – Fragment – Medium}}
          + campaignName – {{Lookup – URL – Fragment – Campaign Name}}

   The values will now be sent to Google Analytics just as if you were
   using the UTM parameters: utm_source, utm_medium and utm_campaign.
   Here’s how it looks like in the Google Tag Manager:

   Google Tag Manager Pageview Tag

Step 5

   Now it’s time to test if everything you’ve done works properly:
     * Enable the ‘Preview Mode’. Click on the arrow next to the ‘Publish’
       button and select ‘Preview’.
     * Load your web page with ‘#agency’ appended to the end of your URL,
       like this: https://yourdomain.com/#agency
     * Then, using Google Tag Manager’s Preview Mode, open the ‘Page View’
       tag and look through the ‘Variables’ menu.
     * You should see the ‘Lookup – URL – Fragment – Campaign Name’,
       ‘Lookup – URL – Fragment – Medium’ and ‘Lookup – URL – Fragment –
       Source’ variables fire with ‘profile page’, ‘social’ and ‘linkedin’
       as values (‘agency’ comes after the hashtag in your URL).

   Take a look at the screenshot:

   GTM Preview Mode

   You should also check your Real-Time Traffic Sources report to see
   which mediums and sources referred the users who are on your site right
   now. You should see yourself in this report as well.

Here are a couple of examples

Facebook profile page

Things to keep in mind

     * You can have hundreds of rows in your Lookup Table and it’s still
       very fast.
     * The Lookup Table is an exact match only in Google Tag Manager. To
       use partial matches you’d need to either modify the strings before
       the Lookup Table accesses them, i.e. create a Custom JavaScript
       Variable which strips the elements down.
     * Always test your changes before you publish.

Why are URL shorteners not always a good solution?

   Even though using shorteners (e.g bit.ly) is a good way to hide
   tracking information and make URLs shorter, they still do not seem be
   100% trustworthy and there are a lot of reasons why I prefer not to use
   them.

   Things to keep in mind when using URL shorteners
     * URL shorteners record click data, Google Analytics records hits,
       sessions, and users. Technically, those tools are not going to show
       the same data because they are tracking different things.
     * Always attach your Google Analytics UTM parameters to the end of
       the URL before you drop it in your URL shortener. If you’re not
       doing this, all of your short links are feeding zero useful data,
       especially if people are coming to your site from mobile apps,
       desktop email clients or non-HTML documents.

   In some cases, you also might want to put UTM tags on 301 redirects.

Final Thoughts

   URL fragments are much more acceptable and trustworthy than UTM
   parameters and shortened URLs.
   I believe that it’s not too much hassle to go to Google Tag Manager
   before publishing a new link and adding some values to your Lookup
   Tables. Especially, if those are the links that you want to track
   without showing Google Analytics UTM parameters.
