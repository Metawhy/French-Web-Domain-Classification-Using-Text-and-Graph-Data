Overview
                 An architectural treasure inside and out, City Hall is
                 the largest municipal building in the United States, with
                 over 14.5 acres of floor space.
                 Topped with an iconic statue of William Penn, the
                 548-foot tower is the tallest masonry structure in the
                 world without a steel frame; it was the tallest building
                 in Philadelphia until 1987.
                 The public rooms are among the most lavish in the city;
                 the City Council Chamber, the Mayor’s Reception Room,
                 Conversation Hall and the Supreme Court Room are the most
                 ornate.
                 Visitors can join guided tours to learn about the
                 building’s history and view the city from above from the
                 open-air observation deck.

The History
                 In his original 1682 design for the city, William Penn
                 set aside the Center Square for public buildings, but it
                 took 200 years before the square was used for that
                 purpose.

     City Hall is the largest municipal building in the United States,
     containing over 14.5 acres of floor space.
                 The first City Hall was located at 2nd and Market
                 streets, then moved to 5th and Chestnut streets when the
                 Independence Hall complex was built.
                 Architect John McArthur, Jr. supervised the construction
                 of the present-day City Hall on Center Square, which
                 began in 1871 and took more than 30 years to complete.
                 The building’s exterior is covered with intricate
                 sculptures representing the seasons and continents, as
                 well as allegorical figures, heads and masks. All of the
                 sculptures were designed by Alexander Milne Calder,
                 including the 27-ton statue of William Penn atop the
                 tower.
                 The observation deck provides a panoramic view of the
                 city.   — Photo by M. Fischetti for Visit Philadelphia

Admission & Info
                 Two tours offer the opportunity to explore the beauty and
                 majesty of this municipal gem.
                 On the Tower Tour, visitors take an elevator to the top
                 of the building, where an open-air observation deck
                 offers sweeping views of the city and its surroundings.
                 Timed tickets are required.
                 Offered once a day, the two-hour Interior Tour explores
                 the building’s rich history, art and architecture,
                 complete with little-known facts and access to some of
                 the most impressive rooms. This tour also includes a
                 visit to the observation deck.

Events & More
                 Located at the foot of City Hall, Dilworth Park hosts

                 are free and open to the public.

                 garden, a holiday market and the Deck the Hall light
                 show, which is projected onto the facade of City Hall.
