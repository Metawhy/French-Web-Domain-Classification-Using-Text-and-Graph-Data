All Politics is Local, Even a Bernie Campaign

   By Ravi Ahmad

   Being in leadership in DSA has been quite a trip. Most folks are
   probably at least somewhat aware that I’ve been through several cycles
   of activism and organizing, from the Communist Party of India (Marxist)
   to Occupy Wall Street to DSA, with several stops along the way. I also
   have a few advanced degrees, one in Marxist economics. Being somewhat
   eclectic in my own training and experience, I’ve become rather fond of
   the big tent approach we’re developing here in DSA in fits and starts.
   It has allowed a lot of DSA members, new and old, to think in ways
   other groups have mostly neglected, whether  the Democratic Party, the
   unions, or all sorts of nonprofits.

   I plan to write elsewhere about base-building at greater length, based
   on the four to six calls I have every week with DSA members around the
   country. I’ve been particularly struck by the common themes in these
   conversations; specifically, even our largest chapters are only just
   beginning to develop an understanding of their political terrain at the
   level of most successful community organizations, let alone developing
   anything beyond that.

   Most of what passes for progressive and even radical activism has given
   up on growing deep roots with strategic direction being spread among
   larger and larger groups of people. Instead, left-of-center
   organizations tend to operate at the level of narrative and the
   all-important Discourse instead of cultivating genuinely grassroots
   politics.

   My point is this: we are only at the beginning of a socialist
   resurgence in America.

   I have my own political analysis and judgments, but as a member of the
   National Political Committee, I am also responsible for nurturing the
   political capacities of all our members. I seek to do this not through
   telling DSA’s members what to do but by helping folks navigate the
   terrain so we can figure things out together. I helped found @BuildDSA
   this past summer to connect members with one another and start to
   create a national organization that lives up to the name. But I’ll take
   off my Build hat, for a minute and speak to my own politics here.

   I have been very candid about finding the yes/no framing on the Bernie
   endorsement question kind of tired. This isn’t because I don’t care
   about or devalue folks who haven’t made up their minds or folks who are
   frustrated about the endorsement process that the NPC has adopted; I
   voted against this process for a variety of reasons ones I’ve shared
   with many in DSA. Bernie is running and we should be talking out what
   that means, not falling into this tired framing that’s rooted in the
   party line question- to Dem or not to Dem- with which the sectarian
   Left in this country has been obsessed for ages. Its an important
   question but doesn’t apply here. Bernie is running and on the
   Democratic ticket. It’s done. Let’s move on.

   In the same vein, I won’t bore everyone by repeating the stakes
   involved: Trump layered over the long-running crisis that is capitalism
   and ecological disaster is something most DSA members are pretty
   familiar with, right? Well, here’s something we barely dig into: Trump
   is the result of a 40+ year strategic plan by the hard Right which has
   rolled back even the most minimal social democratic wins working people
   have achieved in this country. The legacies of the New Deal, Civil
   Rights, Women’s Liberation Movement, and the Great Society have been
   eviscerated and, with privatized education and the resurgence of prison
   labor, we are actively being returned to the late 19th century. Having
   a firm footing feels all the more important in this context.

   I believe that DSA should aim to be part of a larger movement ecology,
   with institutions and organizations that reinforce each other. There
   are struggles in motion all around us, whether to get your kids fed
   regularly or to end cash bail or to get a decent contract at work. (Or
   fires, as in the above video. Bernie Sanders joined some of the above
   firefighters at a campaign rally right in Chico. — Ed. ) The long
   strategic retreat of recent decades has  many lessons to teach us, both
   good and bad. Thus, we can coordinate and survive if one group or
   another gets picked off the way ACORN was destroyed. Within this
   context, we should be measuring our campaigns against whether they
   build a base for DSA in the world, not in our subcommittees. Socialism
   is, after all, for society.

   What is a base? The concept is popular in The Discourse, because we’re
   all feeling the lack of solid grounding under our feet. A base is a
   group of people with a common set of interests & motivations that acts
   together in its own interest. This is a basic prerequisite for the
   development of class consciousness, which is itself a prerequisite for
   a working-class political party. This is the most basic requirement for
   collective self-awareness and key if DSA is to move beyond being an
   expression of its current most active members, rather than a larger
   community of interest.

   In my weekly check-ins with members from coast to coast, I’ve gathered
   that even our largest chapters are just beginning to answer the
   following questions which are absolutely vital for a powermap to begin
   planning your chapter electoral strategy:
     *
          + Who moves votes in your town? Is it churches, unions,
            community groups, democratic party clubs? How do these
            breakdown along lines of neighborhood, race, class and
            ethnicity?

     *
          + How close is your DSA chapter to any of these organizations?
            Do you know what they need in what are likely long running
            struggles around electoral and non-electoral work?

     *
          + How does that mediocre state rep or city councilor always get
            re-elected? He’s so useless! How does he get re-elected every
            time? It’s so annoying!

     *
          + Are any of these organizations absolute deal breakers? There
            are unions without whom electeds can’t get elected and you
            need to know who they are, whether we work with them or not.

     *
          + What are the rules for participating in your local primary? In
            New York, you have to confirm your party registration way
            early and a LOT of people weren’t able to vote for Bernie in
            the primary. Is this something to add to your tabling plans
            either as a standalone outreach campaign or as part of your
            regular efforts?

     * What is the map of voter suppression in your community? Who does
       voter security work in your neck of the woods? And if you think
       this is a red state problem, the Brooklyn Board of Elections purged
       200,000 voters ahead of the 2016 primary, almost certainly aimed at
       decreasing Bernie’s share of the vote.

   It is only through reflection, conversation, and analysis that we can
   have meaningful conversations and find common ground in our fledgling
   organization. There will be places where close coordination with the
   Bernie campaign will be the best way to accomplish these ends of
   understanding our local political landscape and navigating it for
   Bernie or any other campaign. There will be others- like my old
   hometown- where DSA running an independent campaign may be the only way
   to get Bernie through the primary.

   We should not be tying down our chapters to a rigid course of action
   before we have a chance to explore and determine our strategic
   priorities, locally and nationally.

Countering the Sanitizing of the Vietnam War

   November 13, 2016

   Review: The American War in Vietnam: Crime or Commitment, by John
   Maricano (Monthly Review Press)

   By Jack Rothman

   Marciano_book.jpg

   The recent book by John Marciano, The American War in Vietnam: Crime or
   Commitment (Monthly Review Press) is an antidote. It is a refutation of
   the government’s massive campaign to render the Vietnam War an
   honorable undertaking that upheld the highest values of the nation.

   On Memorial Day of 2012, President Barack Obama announced the beginning
   of the Vietnam War Commemoration, which will continue through 13 years
   until Veterans Day 2025, a year that marks the 50^th anniversary of the
   end of the war. There will be a panoply of patriotic events involving
   partnering with local governments, private organizations, and
   communities across the country. All of this will be conducted under the
   auspices of the Department of Defense, not the most neutral arbiter of
   issues concerning war and peace. The nation is about to receive an
   all-out multi-million-dollar “snow job” about what happened during the
   war and why.

   The president set the tone with his call to “reflect with solemn
   reverence upon the valor of a generation that served with honor . . .
   fighting heroically to protect the ideals we hold dear as Americans.”
   Marciano’s book dismantles the “noble cause” edifice on which the
   Commemoration hangs. Marciano, an emeritus professor at SUNY Cortland,
   shows that the U.S. started its Vietnam involvement by bolstering the
   efforts of the French to continue their colonial rule over Vietnam
   following WWII. When the French campaign collapsed at Dien Bien Phu, we
   made the defeat of the Vietnam independence movement the lynchpin of a
   global U.S. drive to dominate world affairs, tied in with our
   anti-communist Cold War operations. Marciano holds that America’s
   determination to control events is for its own self -interest, rather
   than to propagate democracy and freedom everywhere. That deceit is at
   the core of the Vietnam invasion and a host of other invasions that
   have followed.

   The book covers the full trajectory of the war, providing a concise
   overview that is wide-ranging and factual. It is a primer on the war
   that is both passionate and deeply researched. For a short book of only
   160 pages, it has a prodigious 26 pages of references and bibliography.
   But the writing is fluid and hard-hitting, not encumbered by a
   prominent historian’s grasp of the details of the subject matter. The
   narrative comes across as the work of an incensed Old Testament prophet
   who is not afraid to cite references.

   The war is covered in four phases, starting with the American takeover
   of the French armed struggle to keep Vietnam a colony, referenced
   above. Next is the nine-year Diem regime, marked by President John F.
   Kennedy’s strategy of employing advisors to train police, Special
   Forces actions, and covert warfare.  The Diem regime was embraced by
   JFK, but its inability to gain popular support and make military
   advances led to a coup and assassination, with American contrivance.
   President Lyndon Johnson is critical to the third phase, when there is
   an escalation of the war through a huge scaling up of American troops
   and an upsurge in the level of violence. Marciano details atrocities
   and war crimes perpetrated at this time: Agent Orange and chemical
   warfare, the Hue slaughter, the My Lai Massacre, and the Phoenix
   Program.

   The last phase brings Nixon to the fore, with a change at the tactical
   level and new rhetoric. But basically Nixon presided over the end of
   the war through the rout of the American military by Vietnamese
   fighting for their independence.  He fell from grace through defeats in
   Vietnam and Watergate.

   My skimming through the course of the war doesn’t convey the substance
   and the important context provided in each section of Marciano’s work.
   This is a work of synthesis, consolidation, and interpretation—as well
   as fierce remembrance—giving a critical overview in cogent, readable
   form. Professor Marciano’s most original contribution is his in-depth
   examination of how the Vietnam conflict has been distorted and
   misrepresented systematically in public school history textbooks.

   For me, a prime feature and a bonus of the book is the lessons Marciano
   draws from America’s Vietnam conflict. His observations touch a nerve,
   and I’ll set out just a few of them. He concludes that the undertaking
   was at core an imperialist war. The U.S. and other capitalist nations
   need to preserve an international environment that is conducive to
   safeguarding their trade and investment ventures. Use of military power
   enables them to commandeer natural resources, labor, land, capital, and
   markets. The Vietnam War was part and parcel of a program to suppress
   socialist nations and thwart national liberation movements that free
   countries from reliance on the imperialistic network. This guarantees
   stability for the riches enjoyed by the elites of the dominant class in
   the neoliberal nations.

   Marciano determines that the U.S. surely committed torture and other
   war crimes. There was widespread bombing and employment of artillery
   barrages against unarmed village populations throughout the country.
   This sea of fire sought to terrorize Vietnam into submission. A set
   program of torture accompanied the terror campaign, with extensive use
   of waterboarding, electric shocks, and solitary confinement.

   Marciano observes that Washington lied throughout the campaign, notably
   regarding the Tonkin Gulf crisis of Aug. 1964, which was a pretense to
   amplify military actions.  And contrary to assertions that the
   mainstream press opposed and undermined the war effort, the author
   maintains that the media never went against the conflict. They endorsed
   the war wholeheartedly until the Tet Offensive in early 1968, when they
   shifted to criticizing ineffective tactics. The basic premise of the
   “noble cause” and the underlying imperialist thrust of the war were
   never challenged.

   I personally met Professor Marciano when I signed on to a
   community-based course he taught in Los Angeles, as a no-cost public
   service, analyzing the history of American imperialism. I can assert
   that his fervent anti-war views come over with the same power orally as
   they do on the written page. In his book, he states that a clear
   understanding of the Vietnam War requires that citizens reject the
   official government version and draw their own critical and moral
   conclusions. Only then will they be able to see through the propaganda
   onslaught of the Commemoration spectacle and “confront the war makers
   and war machine” on firm ground. We should be deeply grateful for this
   book, which is a major assist for that to happen.

   Jack Rothman is professor emeritus at the UCLA School of Public
   Affairs and a member of Los Angeles DSA.

Emergency Post-Charlottesville DSA Organizing Guide

   August 16, 2017

   For all DSA members and chapters, here is our post-Charlottesville
   organizing guide. There are some great tips here about running
   meetings, doing outreach, and finding concrete ways to help. You can
   download the guide under the “Attachments and Resources” section of
   this page.

   We also have a great DSA anti-fascist, anti-hate sign available for
   download. You can print this out for rallies in your area, or to put in
   your window.

   We cannot allow the organized neo-Nazi movement to use the
   Charlottesville tragedy to consolidate and expand their violent
   offensive against people of color and against the left.

   Therefore, a three pronged strategy should structure our work.
    1. Defend our communities and institutions from neo-fascist violence.
    2. Continue to organize a grassroots multi-racial working class
       movement fighting for visionary, transformative reforms like
       Medicare for all.
    3. Fight the battle of ideas – fight racism and anti-Semitism with
       socialism, not with neoliberalism.

   People everywhere will be looking to groups like DSA for a community of
   support and ways to take action, so we recommend you organize general
   interest DSA meetings to recruit folks for near and long term action.

DSA’s Anti-Trump Organizing is Up — And the Press Has Noticed

   February 16, 2017

   Since inauguration, over 3,000 new members have joined DSA. Together
   we’re building the strong democratic socialist resistance we need. DSA
   has added to our organizing staff and increased volunteer training. New
   DSA groups are starting across the country. The word about DSA is
   definitely out.

   "democratic-socialists-of-americaRollingStoneImage.jpg"

   DSA is in action, and the press is paying attention. In the build-up to
   the anti-inauguration protests, ATTN: interviewed DSA’s David Duhalde
   and Sammy Almashat for advice for first-time protest marchers. You can
   see a great gallery of DSA at the anti-inauguration protests from
   Medill News Service. Now, Rolling Stone shows DSA organizers and
   members across the country building on Bernie’s momentum as a force
   against Trump. New DSA groups, like Long Beach DSA in California, are
   getting positive local coverage. We will keep you posted!
