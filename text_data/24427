   Research and development on distributed, decentralized, and formally
   verified software

   Nomadic Labs houses a team focused on Research and Development. Our
   core competencies are in programming language theory and practice,
   distributed systems, and formal verification. We believe our strength
   lies in a unique mix of skills and experience, allowing us to transfer
   the best of academic research into real world applications.
   We currently focus on contributing to the development of the Tezos core
   software, including the smart-contract language, Michelson. We also
   have a mobile team working on the Cortez wallet.
   As a member of the Tezos community, we are fortunate to collaborate
   daily with academic institutions and many other contributors to the
   ecosystem. Some of our closest collaborators are researchers from the
   French research institute Inria, OCaml Labs in Cambridge (UK), OCamlPro
   and Tarides in Paris, Obsidian Systems and Cryptonomic in NYC,
   Dailambda in Kyoto and, last but not least, many individual developers.
