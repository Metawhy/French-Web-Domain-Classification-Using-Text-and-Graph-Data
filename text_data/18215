   Exploring the Entire Tree of Life

   [img1.png]
   [lm-gp.png]

   Tree simplified from NCBI taxonomy

   ~800,000 species
   This 'large public' tree is a reduction of the whole NCBI taxonomy. It
   only shows species (no strains, environmental samples, unidentified
   species, etc.). It displays a descritption and picture retrieved from
   Wikipedia when clicking on the tips and nodes.

   [lm-ncbi.png]

   Complete NCBI taxonomy

   ~1.4 Million species
   The NCBI taxonomic tree represents the relationships between all
   species/strains that have at least one sequence in the NCBI/Entrez
   database. It is curated and validated by expert taxonomists and is
   updated regularly.

    Lifemap is an interactive tool to explore the tree of life. The
   concept used in Lifemap is similar to the one used in cartography with
   tools like Google Maps© or Open Street Maps: exploring is done by
   zooming and panning.

    The current tree contains 802639 species: 3733 Archaea, 277426
   Bacteria and 521480 Eukaryotes. It is based on the taxonomy publised by
   the NCBI and updated regularly.

    All the nodes in the tree are clickable. It displays information
   (description and picture) concerning the taxa (retrieved from the
   ikipedia page, if any). If you have description or pictures you would
   like to see in Lifemap, simply create or update the corresponding
   ikipedia page.

    Itineraries between taxa can be computed by clicking on the bottom
   right button of the main page and filling the two search fields. When
   filled, the route is drawn between the taxa, the Most Recent Common
   Ancestor (MRCA) of the two groups/species is returned. The user gets
   also access to a list of all the nodes that are encountered in the way
   from one group to the other. This list is clickable.

    Lifemap was written by Damien M. de Vienne, a CNRS researcher working
   in the Laboratory of Biometry and Evolutionary Biology (LBBE) in Lyon
   (France) with support from the informatics departement (especially
   Stephane Delmotte and Bruno Spattaro).

    Itineraries between taxa can be computed by clicking on the icon on
   the left of the search field. When filling the two new search fields,
   the route is drawn between the taxa and the Most Recent Common Ancestor
   (MRCA) of the two groups/species is returned. The user gets also access
   to a list of all the nodes that are encountered in the way from one
   group to the other. This list is clickable.

    'Expert' versions of Lifemap, dedicated to the researchers in
   genomics, genetics and evolutionary biology also exist. Lifemap-ncbi
   displays the entire NCBI taxonomy (more than 1.1 million taxa) and
   allows (i) an easy access to NCBI web pages, (ii) the visualization and
   count of genomes completely sequenced and (iii) the possibility to
   download every subtree for every node in Newick format. Lifemap-otol
   allows exploring the whole tree produced by the 'Open Tree of Life'
   project (around 2.2 Million species). Again, it allows easy access to
   other taxonomic resources at each node, and the possibility to download
   every subtree in Newick format.

    Lifemap was written by Damien M. de Vienne (web page), a CNRS
   researcher working in the Laboratory of Biometry and Evolutionary
   Biology (LBBE) in Lyon (France) with support from the informatics
   departement (especially Stephane Delmotte and Bruno Spataro).

   A virtual machine to explore your own trees

   [lm-server-download.png]
   Download the Lifemap-server Virtual Machine now (3.6 Go)

   Lifemap-server Virtual Machine was created in order for users to be
   able to explore their own trees, and not only the precomputed Tree(s)
   of Life available on the home page. To start using Lifemap-server,
   simply follow the instructions below.

   Lifemap-server runs on all plateforms (OS,linux,Windows). It only
   requires a (free) virtualization program to be installed. I recommend
   using Virtualbox.

   Lifemap-server will run locally on your computer. To be able to share
   the tree that you created, you will have to put this virtual machine on
   a public server of your own.
   Instructions
    1. Download and install Virtualbox: https://www.virtualbox.org/
    2. Download the Lifemap-server virtual machine by clicking on the
       large button on the left.
    3. Once done, launch the Virtual Machine with Virtualbox by
       double-clicking the file you just downloaded.
    4. When the virtual machine is running, open your favorite web browser
       (Chrome or Firefox) and simply type: localhost:5580 in the url bar.
    5. That's it! You will see a web page where you can upload a tree file
       (Newick) and explore the uploaded tree.

   Note that you can change the memory and the number of CPUs that you
   attribute to the virtual machine. If you want to explore trees with
   million of leaves, you may consider changing these values.

Welcome to Lifemap-server

   This document explains you how to use Lifemap-server for visualizing
   your own (huge) trees (up to many million species) that resemble the
   Lifemap Tree(s) of Life presented here or here.

   Visualizing your own tree is as simple as launching a virtual machine
   (double-click) and copy-pasting or uploading your own tree file on a
   web page. Follow this link to get started.

   Another option (for more advanced programmers) consists in setting up
   your own Lifemap-server on your own machine or server. This option is
   useful if you want to modify some of the code on which Lifemap relies
   and/or if you want one of your trees to be available to others on the
   internet. (however that for this last possibility, using the virtual
   machine and modifying it may be easier)
