   [Vulcano_Is.jpg]

   Vulcano is a volcanic island and the southernmost of the Aeolian
   Islands. It is made from several overlapping volcanic centers. The
   older stratovolcano is just to the left of the center of the photo.
   Fossa cone, the most recently active vent, is near the center of the
   photo. Vulcanello, a young cone, is the foreground. Photograph by Chuck
   Wood.

   [SO17.jpg]
   This photo shows the flanks of the older stratovolcano that makes the
   southern part of the island.

   International.

   The history of Vulcano begins with the formation of a stratovolcano
   that collapsed to producing the Il Piano caldera. The caldera is
   partially filled with pyroclastic deposits and lava flows. This
   stratovolcano and caldera make the southern part of the island.

   [Lentia.jpg]
   The Lentia lava dome complex grew to the northwest of the older
   stratovolcano. The dome complex also collapsed to produce a caldera.
   This photo shows the southeast wall of the caldera. Photograph by Chuck
   Wood.

   [Fossa.jpg]

   The Fossa cone grew within the Lentia caldera. Fossa makes up most of
   the northern part of the island. The cone began to form sometime after
   11,000-8,500 years ago. At least four volcanic cycles constructed the
   cone. Each of the four known cycles had different vent locations and
   different eruptive histories. In general, however, each cycle started
   with phreatic eruptions and ended with eruptions that produced pumice
   fall deposits or lava flows. Photograph by Chuck Wood.

   The youngest cone on the island, Vulcanello, began to form in 183 B.C.

   middle ground. The island of Lipari is just beyond Vulcanello.

   [Vulcano_1.jpg]

   Vulcano last erupted from 1888 to 1890. The eruption deposited 15 feet
   (5 m) of pyroclastic material at the summit of Fossa. Bombs about 3
   feet (1 m) in diameter fell 0.6 miles (1 km) from the vent.

   [Vulcano_2.jpg]

   The Vulcanian style of eruption is based on the 1888-1890 eruption of
   Vulcano. Vulcano was quiet for the preceding 100 years. The eruption
   started with the ejection of blocks of old vent material. As the
   eruption progressed it began ejecting fresh lava in the form of blocks,
   bomb, and ash. Breadcrust bombs, distinctive to this style of eruption,
   were ejected about half-way through the eruption. Explosions were
   intermittent and separated by quiet periods lasting a few minutes to a
   few days. Explosions varied in strength. Only the largest explosions
   could throw blocks and bombs. Strong eruptions were separated by longer
   quiet periods. No domes or lava flows were produced at the end of the
   eruption.

   [Vulcano_3.jpg]

   Our word volcano owes it's origin to Vulcano. The Roman god of fire,
   responsible for making the weapons of the gods, was called Vulcan and
   he lived within the volcano we call Vulcano. The glow of eruptions was
   thought to be from Vulcan's forges as we worked beneath the earth.

Mount Etna Erupts!

     * Etna

   [D74jdx8XUAEKGFp.jpg]

   Scenes of #Etna's new, sub-terminal eruption, during the night of 30-31
   May 2019, seen from Santa Venerina, Fiumefreddo and (last photo)
   Tremestieri Etneo. "Sub-terminal" means the eruption is occurring close
   to the summit craters, generally at around 2900-3000 m elevation.

HVO Confirms Geo-thermal Drilling not Related to Kilauea Eruption

   In this week’s Volcano Watch article – as well as a recent radio
   interview – the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory is again saying that
   the 2018 eruption of Kīlauea Volcano was not triggered by Puna
   Geothermal Venture. Check out the video above for more information and
   an interview with HVO's Tina Neal from Big Island Video News.

No. Yellowstone is not 'Overdue'

     * Yellowstone

   Image of Yellowstone by Heinrich Berann

   "It seems like you can't read an article or watch a documentary about a
   natural hazard without hearing that some event is "overdue." A flood on
   a certain river is overdue, or a hurricane in a given place is overdue,
   or an earthquake of some magnitude is overdue, or a volcanic eruption
   is overdue. It's basically a cliché, and no documentary or article can
   be complete without it.

   We've heard many statements that Yellowstone is overdue -- that it has
   a major eruption every 600,000 years on average, and since the last
   eruption was 631,000 years ago...well...you can see where this is
   going. Is this true? In a word, no. In two words, no way. In three
   words, not even close. Yellowstone doesn't work that way."
