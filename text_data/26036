rambling again, but not here, over there ...

   well never say never right!
   what a difference a day makes, or a month or a year or more...
   it would appear out of nowhere the urge to ramble has come upon me and
   therefore i have taken up my trusty keyboard and positioned myself over
   here under the anonymous name of Milo's Mews.
   gosh that is like those folks who write huge novels yet do not use
   their real name but that of another, an alter ego. "ummm, hello! which
   is exactly what you did here Tif", "well spotted!" but now i am doing
   over there. ha! such cleverness such trickery.
   i have no idea how long the urge will last, nor shall i fret about such
   things. for now it is what it is and that is good enough. so if you
   have stumbled upon this blog like others before you, and perhaps
   bemoaned the fact i no longer frequent this space, then you are invited
   to come visit me over at curious.and.coe under my cunning disguise of
   Milo's Mews. i cannot promise wit, nor anything related to this lovely
   patch of the woods, but i can promise a bit of dribbling on about this
   and that and the occasional rant or offering of enlightenment along the
   way.
   such daringness for me, such quiet activist ways, such a chance to find
   a little bit of golden on any given day ...

where for art thou Tif ...

   gosh, can it really be 2 years or more since i have visited this neck
   of the dottie angel woods. if i could i would tell you in a nutshell
   what i have been [DEL: up to, :DEL]  [DEL: doing :DEL]  'being', but i
   can't, so i shan't. however if i may be so bold, i would love to tell
   you where i can be found loitering these days aside from my studio and
   my 'cushion'.
   me and my youngest lad have set out on an adventure together, the
   adventure is called curious.and.coe

   you can find us right over here and if perchance you have missed a
   ramble or two i can be found along with Milo the Buddha Cat
   waffling-a-long right here.
   i do not know what our new column will be, for so long i kept the mute
   button on but in the past few months it has become increasingly clear i
   need to find an outlet for all these jumbly bumbly words within my
   head. if i can spill them onto paper, give them some breathing room, i
   believe there will become lightness within. i also could be quite
   wrong... ha! who knows!
   so there we have it, i did not think i would come back, but i have, not
   quite back here, but back over there, so not back at all, but forward
   if you please... and if you would like to come visit, you are most
   welcome and if you would prefer to stay in this part of dottie angel's
   neck of the woods, you are also most welcome and may i thank you most
   kindly for keeping her company.
   Tif x

the end ...


   [photo.JPG11%2B-%2BCopy.JPG]
     did you know it is eight years since i started tippity tapping away
   here on my shiny happy place. i went way back and found my first post.
   i really truly had no idea what i was doing, nor where i was going and
   those were perhaps the happiest times of my rambling blogging journey.
   and it is without doubt, if it were not for my blog and you dearest
   readers i would not have done so many wonderful things, met so many
   wonderful peachy dearies and grown in so many wonderful ways. i spent
   many happy times, regaling whoever may happen to wish to read, clan
   moments, critter moments, crafty moments, thrifting moments and any
   other moments that i chose to share. and it goes without saying, there
   have been many other moments i did not share. some pants, some peachy.
   gosh this does sound like it is turning into a farewell swan song,
   which is not my intention, for this is written not with sadness but
   happiness in my heart. i am happy to be leaving this lovely shiny place
   just as it is, for anyone who may care to visit or stumble upon me.
   however i have decided it is time to retire my blogging hat, carefully
   placing it back in my kitchen drawer and to continue treading the path
   i have started out upon in recent times. you will find me happily
   woolly tattooing and making little knits in preparation for my online
   'atelier of sorts for small beings & grown~ups' opening later in the
   year. i will of course still be found over on facebook as and when
   nitty gritty things and photos need to be shared and you will find me
   daily in my happy place over on instagram. in a few months i have high
   hopes my new shiny online home will be all set up, a place for folks to
   visit and see what handmade wares i have for sale, all made slowly,
   with beautiful yarns and vintage materials. in my head i am seeing it
   as a happy heirloom collection of sorts and in my hands, those thoughts
   are slowly but surely coming together
   and so before i close the final floral curtain upon this rambling and
   at times, bumbling stage, can i just say, i have been nothing but
   humbled by the kindness of others who came through the life i shared
   for the past 8 years. you shared my laughter, you shared my joy, you
   shared my pain and you shared my tears. how truly lucky am i in life to
   have had all this and more. and if this is it, if this is as good as it
   gets, then that is a~okay with me. for i have been blessed, and i will
   never feel quite so loved again and okay to be me, as the times i
   rambled on here and you choose to listen.
   thank you, thank you kindly dearest readers, old ones, new ones, furry
   ones and fruity cake ones. it may look like the end, but i assure you,
   it is not it truly really is not.
   [DEL: the end :DEL]
   this is just the beginning ...
