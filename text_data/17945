     * I called on One Click Root after my own initial attempt for root
       bricked my LG G4 (H81010o). If you have a new phone running the
       latest and more challenging software, then I recommend this
       service. Its well worth the money. Technician "JJ" helped me and
       was a smooth and very capable professional. Rarely do I pay for

What Customers are Saying

     * I called on One Click Root after my own initial attempt for root
       bricked my LG G4 (H81010o). If you have a new phone running the
       latest and more challenging software, then I recommend this
       service. Its well worth the money. Technician "JJ" helped me and
       was a smooth and very capable professional. Rarely do I pay for
       tech support or make endorsements so purchase with confidence,
       these folks are legit!

     * I had a great experience with JJ helping me to root my phone. The
       Samsung Galaxy S4 is a hard phone to root and took a few attempted,
       but everything worked out. Root delivered as promised. Thanks!

     * Just wanted to say thank you very much to JJ, he spent several
       hours wrestling with my tablet, was polite throughout, helpful,
       informative and wouldn't give up. A credit to his employers, and
       should be given a pat on the back, well done üôÇ
