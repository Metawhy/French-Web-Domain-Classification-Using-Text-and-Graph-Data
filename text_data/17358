   The EuroStoxx 50 is managed and licensed by STOXX Limited, which was a
   joint venture of Deutsche Boerse AG (which issues DAX 30 index), Dow
   Jones & Company and the SWX Group. Stoxx Ltd. is a globally integrated
   index provider that denotes equity market investments worldwide.

   In order to be included in the Euro STOXX 50 index the country must be

A Brief History of Euro STOXX 50

   STOXX Limited is owned by the Deutsche Borse AG (group) and since 1998
   has been managing and licensing indices. Initially, when it was
   launched, the company focused mainly on the European stocks. Today,
   however, its offerings are substantially broadened and include indices
   from nearly every country in the world.

Index composition

   The Euro Stoxx 50 index is reviewed annually in September and assessed
   for any index component changes. The Eurozone’s largest 50 stocks that
   form the Euro STOXX 50 Index are automatically chosen from the Euro
   STOXX Index by market capitalization.

   The fact that The EURO STOXX 50 is owned by the Deutsche Borse, Dow
   Jones, and SWX Group, makes it a popular choice among speculative
   traders and investors. They are mostly interested in the indices
   developments, and view this as a marker of Europe’s economic health.

Factors influencing the Euro STOXX 50 index price

   The key factors that create price movements in the Euro STOXX 50 price
   are country-wide or sectorial economic shifts, trade
   agreements/embargo, industry-specific taxation or legislation changes,
   significant shifts in share price of one or several of the major
   constituents.

   A significant part of the EURO STOXX 50 index composition is the
   banking sector. Therefore, currency markets have a particularly high
   influence on the index’s performance, as opposed to broader market
   indices like S&P 500.

   The second most influential sector is Industrial Goods and Services
   with 10.7% of the index weight.

   The two countries having the most impact on the index price dynamics
   are France, with 36.65% of the index market cap belonging to French
   companies, and Germany with 33.3%.

   The events that shake the stock market and influence the index price
   dynamics are political events such as Brexit (UK leaving Eurozone),
   local elections, EU legislation issues, etc. These should be watched
   closely in cfd trading online.

   During the financial crisis that ripped through European markets in
   2007, the index was also impacted by the news and fears of increased
   debts that were inflicting the Eurozone. There was also December 2013’s
   high unemployment rate of 25%. With the EURO STOXX 50 being affected by
   European news, it can be a volatile instrument and provides some
   exciting opportunities to traders.

What makes Euro STOXX 50 an attractive trading instrument

   This index is one of the Europe’s major stock market indices and
   extremely popular among traders. The anticipation of future movements
   of the index itself is necessary to consider, as well as taking into
   account all news and movements relative to the Eurozone and Europe.

   All of the above are clear indications of the stock price and its
   overall performance, allowing traders to gauge their exposure versus
   the instrument’s volatility.

   Online traders can use the Euro stoxx 50 as a great opportunity to
   trade the instability of the Eurozone markets. Many of the companies
   are from a specific industry and, by staying on top of these
   industries, one can benefit and trade better overall with the EURO
   STOXX 50.

   Hang Seng Index trading

An Overview of China’s Financial Engine – HSI

   With a market cap weighted index of 40 of the largest companies traded
   to date on the Hong Kong Exchange, the Hang Seng Index (HSI) is one of
   Asia’s biggest indices.

   Maintained by the Hang Seng Bank, the HSI has been published since
   1969, and is the leader of the HKE, covering 65% of its market
   capitalization. HS members are also classified into one of four
   sub-indices that include the commerce, utilities, properties and
   finance industries.

   The Hang Seng is the most widely quoted barometer for the Chinese stock
   trading market and the Hong Kong economy. As Hong Kong’s status is
   known as a special administrative region of China, there are close ties
   between their economies and a lot of Chinese companies are listed on
   the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, still held in a majority by the British
   financial firm HSBC.

Interesting facts about the HS Index

   The Hang Seng Index was first published on the 24^th of November 1969
   and it is, to this day, the largest indicator of overall market
   performance in Hong Kong. There are several indices belonging to the
   Hang Seng indices family including: Hang Seng China Enterprises Index,
   Hang Seng China AH Index Series, Hang Seng China H-Financials Index,
   Hang Seng Composite Index Series, Hang Seng China A Industry Top Index,
   Hang Seng Corporate Sustainability Index Series and Hang Seng Total
   Return Index Series.

   The chairman of the Hang Seng Bank, Ho Sin Hang conceived the idea of
   creating the Hang Seng Index as the “Dow Jones” of Hong Kong. Upon
   publication its base of 100 points was set equivalent to the stocks’
   total value as of market close on 31 July, 1964.

   The all-time low this index experienced was 58.61 points on August 31,
   1967. Later the base value was established and the Hang Seng passed the
   10,000-point milestone seen in October 18, 2007, while reaching it’s
   all-time high a few days later, on the 30^th of October 2007, at
   31,958.41 points.

The factors influencing overall index price of the HSI

   As with other indices trading, there are many macro and micro-economic
   factors that can influence the Hang Seng Index. As it has a close
   correlation to the Chinese economical current, the Chinese market has a
   great and almost immediate impact on the index. One economic shift for
   example would be the Yuan/Dollar peg being removed not in its entirety
   as they will be pegging it to a basket of currencies and not just the
   USD.

   The impact of the Yuan devaluation in August 2015 by the People’s Bank
   of China (PBOC) shook the markets with three consecutive devaluations
   of the Yuan renminbi (CNY), remaining 30% lower than its previous
   value.

   With the CNY/USD peg being removed as well as the Yuan devaluation (as
   explained above) experts are confident these changes did add value to
   the country as well as a boost in support of a better economy. These
   changes did have a direct effect and impact on the Hang Seng Index.

   Political events have an equal role to play. Even when they are not in
   direct correlation to the HSI, they do influence index price dynamics.
   The best example is the announcement of Brexit that led to a 1000
   points drop in the Index.

   Nikkei 225 index trading

Nikkei 225 Trading

   The Nikkei (Nikkei heikin kabuki) 225 also known as the Japan 225, is
   the stock trading market index for the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). The
   Nikkei was first calculated in the 1950 (retroactive to May 1949) and
   is the most widely quoted average of Japanese stocks, today it is
   calculated on a daily basis by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun (Nikkei)
   newspaper.

   The prominent nature of the index allows many profitable products to be
   linked to the Nikkei 225 stocks, which is an indicator of the economic
   situation and movement in Japan. The Nikkei as the US’s Dow Jones, it
   is a price weighted index, and consists of 225 large, publicly-owned
   Japanese companies from an array of industries. This offers investors
   and traders alike an outlook on investment sentiments towards Japanese
   equities.

Nikkei History

   Originally called the ‘Nikkei Dow Jones Stock Average’ from 1975 to
   1985, initially it was established as part of the rebuilding of Japans
   industrial sector, following World War II. The Tokyo Stock Exchange was
   established in 1878, and during the Second World War, the Japanese
   government joined the Tokyo Stock Exchange with a few other leading
   companies at the time to form the Japanese Stock Exchange (JSE).
   Nearing the end of WWII in the latter part of August 1945 the JSE was
   closed down. In May of 1946, the Tokyo Stock Exchange re-opened under
   the aegis of the new Securities Exchange Act.

   In the late 1980’s, Japan experienced an economic cycle that saw a
   rapid increase (50%) in the Japanese yen’s appreciation, to counter act
   a possible recession the government used fiscal and monetary stimuli.
   Land value as well as stock trading prices fluctuated during this time
   and it was recorded that during 1985-1989 these assets tripled in
   value, and the TSE accounted for 60% of the global stock market
   capitalisation.
   In early 1990 the bubble burst and the first in line to be affected was
   the JPY that fell to one-third of its value that year. Up till October
   2008, the Nikkei traded below 7,000 seeing an 80% decline from it’s
   high in December of 1989. With the assistance of the Bank of Japan and
   economic injection provided by the government the Nikkei rebound
   between June 2012 and June 2015, and still below the 50% high of 1989.

Index composition

   The Nikkei 225 is comprised of 225 stocks that are selected from Japans
   top performing blue-chip companies, based on annual review these
   constituents can be changed. Once it has been decided that a company
   will no longer be a part of the index composition, it is deleted from
   the index and a new one is added following a procedure called
   ‘Extraordinary Replacement’. Once a year, in September a selection is
   conducted based on sector balance and company liquidity, the Nikkei has
   6 sector categories that are consolidated from the 36 Nikkei industrial
   classifications.

   NTT Docomo                   89.6B
   KDDI                         72.9B

Factors that influence the overall index price

   Due to its history the Nikkei 225 index has become famous for being the
   most volatile traded index as it is prone to sharp market moves,
   plunging, rebounding and recovering. Tying the price of the Nikkei to
   the USA is mostly due to the Japans exports to the United States. When
   trading the Nikkei 225 it is always wise to keep your eye on the US
   Markets, as what influences the USA will most likely have a direct
   influence on the Nikkei. In addition to that, Nikkei 225 trading needs
   to run parallel to traders who follow the movements of the US markers
   as well as their indices.

   The Nikkei index is extremely sensitive to global events, such as
   political unrest, war, economical and financial news as well as natural
   disasters. Economic benchmarks such as unemployment rate, interest
   rates increases, GDP figures and job creation are major influences,
   especially these changes happening in the Japan and United States, so
   it would be wise to follow the dynamics of S&P 500 and the Dollar
   Index.

Trade Stocks CFDs

   Share CFDs (Contracts for Difference) have become increasingly popular
   over recent years.

   When you enter into a CFD trade you don’t buy the stock itself but
   instead agree a contract with the broker to settle the difference in
   value between the entry and exit price of the Stock. That means when
   you trade Stocks CFDs with AvaTrade you get a flexibility that stock
   market rules often make impossible.

   With CFDs you can sell shares as easily as buying them, allowing you to
   take advantage of price moves even in a falling market. More
   importantly, because you aren’t actually purchasing the underlying
   asset you can get leverage of up to , allowing you to take a large
   position with a small investment. Leverage of course can significantly
   increase your losses as well as your gains.

   trading Boeing shares

Trade Boeing Stock

   Headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Boeing is one of the world’s
   leading aerospace companies that is involved in designing and
   manufacturing commercial and military aircraft.

   The company also manufactures satellites, defence systems, launch
   vehicles, and provides various support services such as
   performance-based logistics to the commercial airline industry, NASA
   and the US military.

   In 1916, Boeing was founded by William Boeing, a former timber
   merchant. Shortly afterwards, Boeing began selling speedboats to the US
   Navy, resulting in a business relationship with the US government that
   still stands to this day.

   Boeing held its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on the 13^th
   of January 1978, where it is listed and trades under the ticker symbol
   BA.

   The stock falls into the Aerospace sector, under the Aerospace and
   Defence General category. The stock is also part of the Dow Jones
   Industrial Average index.

   Despite its wide portfolio, Boeing’s most successful products have been
   commercial aircraft, and more particularly, the narrow-body 737 family
   that was the first commercial jetliner to cross the 100,000-order mark,
   a feat it achieved in 2012.

   Another successful product for the company has been the 777 aircraft
   that was first flown in 1995 by United Airlines and has grown to cement
   Boeing’s dominant position in the wide-body aircraft segment.

   Over the years, Boeing’s dominance in its sector has been achieved by
   strategic mergers and acquisitions.

   The major deals include McDonnell Douglas Corporation, Rocketdyne,
   Piasecki Helicopter, Hughes Satellite Electronics, Rockwell Aerospace
   International, Aviall Inc., Jeppesen Sanderson Inc., Argon ST Inc.,
   North American Aviation, and KLX Aerospace Solutions.

Boeing Stock History

   Since going public in 1978, Boeing has had 6 stock splits as follows:
   3-for-2 on the 12^th of March 1979; 3-for-2 on the 14th of March 1980;
   3-for-2 on the 10^th of May 1985; 3-for-2 on the 12^th of May 1989;
   3-for-2 on the 18^th of May 1990; and 2-for-1 on the 16^th of May 1997.

   Boeing’s split strategy has always varied, but for the most part, it
   involved splitting as soon as the share price topped three digits.

   Boeing investors have always had a bumpy ride, with Wall Street touting
   it as the classic ‘buy the dip’ stock. In 1990, the stock topped out at
   $31 a share and subsequently plunged into a multi-year downtrend that
   found support in 1993.

   It turned higher strongly, finding resistance at circa $60 a share as
   the effects of the Asian financial crisis started to trickle down in
   1997. A dip to circa $40 got bought again, but the subsequent uptrend
   failed to break the 2001 resistance at $66 a share.

   In 2003, selling pressure pushed the stock lower to a multiyear low of
   $25 per share, which welcomed the ensuing advance that drove the stock
   to $108 in 2007.

   The 2008 global financial crisis triggered a tumble that only found
   support in 2009 at around $32 a share. Since then, Boeing stock has
   been flying to greater heights.

   It broke through the psychological $100 barrier in 2013, and the oil
   price crash of 2014-15 only propelled it higher to 2018 all-time highs
   of $368, that valued the company at over $210 billion.

   Despite swings in its stock price, Boeing has been a regular dividend
   payer. Since the turn of the millennium, Boeing has paid out
   incremental quarterly dividends from $0.14 a share in 2000 to a peak of
   $1.72 a share in 2018.

   The lowest dividend yield was 0.5% in 2011, while the highest so far as
   of 2018, was 3.7% in the first quarter of 2016. As a consistent
   dividend payer and high-value stock, Boeing will likely remain high on
   the priority list of many investors.

How to Trade Boeing Stock

   As one of the most followed and traded stocks in the world, Boeing has
   unique dynamics that every investor should be aware of. Here are some
   of the factors to consider when trading Boeing stock:
     * Tariffs and Trade Agreements
       Boeing products are highly priced, and their customers almost
       always finance all their purchases from the company. Boeing also
       operates a unique business model that entirely involves pre-orders.
       While this guarantees income, it also means that changes to tariffs
       and trade agreements can lead to the cancellation of orders or even
       a reduction in profit margins.

     * New Product Rollouts
       Boeing has a successful model of servicing fixed-price contracts,
       and in most cases, it enjoys a backlog of orders that require a
       minimum of 5 years to service. It is still important to analyse the
       new products it releases because if they fail to become a hit, it
       would mean huge cost overruns for the company. Also due to the high
       costs of their products, there are very long sales cycles and
       customers may not easily be convinced to make purchases.

     * The Economic Cycle
       As seen with the stock history, Boeing is highly exposed to the
       economic cycle. It is precisely why it has earned the title ‘buy
       the dip stock’. It is import to assess the cycles of boom and bust,
       and then implement the appropriate trading strategy in the
       prevailing market conditions.

     * Periodic Earnings Reports
       Boeing’s fiscal year runs from January to December, and the company
       releases quarterly earnings reports to keep shareholders up to date
       on its performance. It is important to track and scrutinise these
       reports thoroughly because unlike most companies, Boeing’s
       performance is typically assessed on it filling existing orders.
       But as an investor, it is prudent to look beyond the competence of
       executing existing contracts and further examine whether new
       revenue streams or future income growth, are plausible.

   As a CFD trader, it is important to assess these factors for their
   short to medium term impact. This will allow one to pick out high
   probability trade opportunities, as opposed to examining long-term
   potential price behaviour where the risk is that all factors have been
   discounted at the prevailing price.
