   ACCUFLEET appoints ADVEEZ to track their dollies
   [accufleet.png]

   Adveez is proud to be choosen by Accufleet to track outdoor their
   dollies in real time in Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International
   Airport.

   One big challenge for airport handler is to locate efficiently their
   equipment.
   IoT and connected objects are great tools to tackle this in the world
   busiest airport, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport,
   Georgia. ACCUFLEET has chosen ADVEEZ in Atlanta to track in real time
   their dollies on the ground.
   ADVEEZ Outdoor Tracking Modules (OTM) are installed on all Accufleet’s
   cargo dollies in Atlanta.
   Indeed, the dollies are essential to transport the ULD containers on
   the ground. Very often handlers needed hours to find them or they where
   parked far away from operations.
   [accufleet%2Bground%2Bhandling.png]
   The ADVEEZ OTM is communicating with the LoRaWAN Comcast network in
   real time. All equipment is displayed in ADVEEZ interactive map and web
   application Localeez®.
   Tracking dollies in real time allow the Accufleet operations to find
   them faster and be more efficient during handling time around the
   plane. Therefore, thanks to ADVEEZ solution Accufleet offer a better
   service quality to airlines and airports.

   Nice airport chooses ADVEEZ speed control system

      In partnership with ground handlers, Nice airport chooses ADVEEZ
     speed control system for GSE to upgrade worker safety in baggage
     galleries....

   d'Azur/J.Kelagopian
   Toulouse- France. Today, in airports, one big issue is speed limitation
   in baggage galleries. Many reported Ground Support Equipment (GSE)
   accidents were linked to excessive speed and bad drivers’ behaviors:
   causing human injuries, vehicles degradation and infrastructure
   damages. Nice Côte d’Azur Airport takes up this challenge with the IoT
   solution.
   To address this issue, prevent accidents and improve safety, they
   contracted Adveez to deploy its Speed Control System on baggage
   galleries of Terminal 1, Terminal 2.1 and Terminal 2.2.
   The system consists of one module installed in each vehicle by the
   ground handler communicating with the 12 beacons fixed on the
   infrastructures by the airport. This installation defines perimeters of
   slowdown areas.
   The speed of the 85 equipped GSEs is now automatically and smoothly
   reduced to 5km/h when operators enter baggage galleries. Outside, the
   speed is released to normal state to ensure normal running.
   Airport managers and GSE operators are very satisfied and reports that
   Adveez system significantly reduces accidents. Moreover, Adveez speed
   control decreases work interruptions, GSEs and infrastructure repair
   costs as well as insurance costs.
   This new installation fall within the process of equipment continuous
   improvement in partnership with the ground handlers to upgrade worker
   safety and the passenger journey fluidity. Pedestrians and workers say
   that it creates a real sense of security and that they can move more
   freely and safely in these slowdown areas.
   To conlude, our system is now part of the internal regulations of Nice
   Côte d'Azur Airport. And managers has requested that it will be
   included in the new project of Terminal 2.3 extension.
   About ADVEEZ
   Since 2011, ADVEEZ develops innovative hardware & software data capture
   solutions for telematics to monitor and optimize critical assets

       Brussels airport chooses ADVEEZ GSE speed control system.

   Toulouse - France. Since January 2019, Brussels airport and the
   electrical GSEs operated by Swissport and Aviapartner are equipped with
   ADVEEZ Speed Control System after being chosen through a public bid
   issued in July 2018. The selection process included a pilot project
   involving the participation of each party: Brussels Airport Company
   acting as the owner of the airport infrastructure with equipped
   automatic doors, as well as both handlers Swissport and Aviapartner
   that equip their electrical GSEs with the Speed Control module or
   Turtle box.
   Thanks to ADVEEZ Turtle box, GSE speed is automatically and
   progressively slowed down when it enters in any baggage hall of
   Brussels airport going from 25km/h to 5km/h. Operational 24/7 without
   generating additional noise pollution and be impacted by dust, ADVEEZ
   Speed Control System is specifically designed for industrial
   environment like airport. Moreover, the Turtle system works  without
   interfering with any other low radio frequency systems already in
   place.
   Listening carefully to our clients, we are continuously improving our
   system to be customized to their needs. Thus, we have developed
   additional safety means to be especially sabotage proof and to last
   longer without maintenance.
   Both Brussels Airport Company and handlers are delighted with ADVEEZ
   Speed Control System as it is a proven and reliable solution improving
   significantly safety and quality.
   With our strong products and innovations, Adveez is proud to continue
   improving the day to day airport fleet management, turning it into
   asset intelligence.

   Adveez completes Third Installation of Airport GSE Speed Control System
   [adveez_speedcontrolsystem.jpg]

     Adveez today announced completion of its 3rd airport Ground Support
     Equipment (GSE) Speed Control System (SCS) installation...

   Adveez today announced completion of its 3rd airport Ground Support
   Equipment (GSE) Speed Control System (SCS) installation at Lyon Airport
   (LYS) in France, following the celebrated success of similar systems
   currently adopted by Nice (NCE) and Marseille (MRS) airports.
   The Adveez GSE SCS solves the wide-spread issue airports face of
   reducing speed in baggage drop-off galleries, tunnels and other areas
   within airports with low speed requirements. Adveez has developed a
   cost-effective speed control system for electric GSEs that immediately
   reduces the speed of a GSE via radio frequency (RF) detection.
   The system consists of a simple receiver installed on individual GSEs,
   and RF beacons that are strategically located before speed restricted
   areas like the entrance of baggage drop-off galleries; when the GSE is
   detected, its speed is automatically switched to slow or "turtle" mode.
   A second beacon is placed at the exit of the speed-restricted area to
   automatically switch the speed of the GSE back to "normal" mode.
   Airport managers and GSE operators (Airlines and GSE handlers) are
   realizing immediate benefits with a significant reduction in accidents
   and reduced cost for repairs and fines. In some cases, invasive speed
   reduction methods like speed bumps have been removed entirely; these
   not only caused excessive wear on vehicles and trailers, but luggage
   would be knocked off carts causing additional delays in delivery. “We
   are getting glowing reviews from airport managers and GSE handlers,”
   said Adveez CEO, Karim Ben Dhia. “Our system directly addresses long
   seated contention between airports and operators about how best to
   reduce speed. The Adveez system is fully automatic, cost-effective, and
   easy to install. Now both parties are happy.”
   The Adveez SCS, sold as a stand-alone system, is part of a larger IoT
   offering of purpose-built electronic control and data capture hardware
   and software for airport GSEs to provide safety, security, tracking,
   and information about equipment usage. This data provides real-time
   information for dynamic maintenance scheduling, accident reduction and
   fleet sizing based on usage, and data to improve plane turn operations.
   “We are currently pursuing other markets where electric vehicle assets
   need speed control, including logistics operations where use of
   electric forklifts is prevalent,” Ben Dhia said.
   About Adveez
   Adveez designs and manufactures data capture and hands-free access
   control hardware and software used in asset tracking and security,
   worker/resident safety and commercial security. Adveez is headquartered
   in Toulouse, France with operating offices in Phoenix, Arizona.
