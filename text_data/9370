European Semiconductor Distribution (DMASS)

Slows down through Spring Quarter

   DMASS reports a decline of 1% in semiconductor growth in Q2/2019.
   Slowdown expected after two record years. Italy, Russia and Israel
   struggle. Power, Analog and Logic hold up strongly.

   London, August 12, 2019 – The second quarter of 2019 finally showed the
   long-expected slowdown of the components distribution market in Europe,
   largely in line with the overall market trends. According to DMASS
   Ltd., the European Semiconductor Distribution Market declined 1% to
   2.32 Billion Euro in Q2.

   Georg Steinberger, chairman of DMASS: “As stated in our last
   announcement, the slowdown was expected, due to weaker bookings in the
   prior periods, and it will continue during the year. Influencing
   factors split between industry-internal reasons – overcapacity in
   memories, long inventory tail at big customers, lacklustre sales in
   consumer products, suppliers taking back business from distribution and
   subsequent price declines – and macro-effects like trade conflicts,
   Brexit and economic uncertainty throughout the industry, despite
   excellent opportunities. Combined with DTAM to TAM changes all have an
   effect on continued price pressure, which overall is influencing the
   magnitude of the downturn we see.”

   At country and region level, Q2 displays a very disparate picture, from
   double-digit growth in smaller countries to double-digit decline in
   medium-sized markets like Italy, Israel and Russia. Among the major
   markets, Germany grew by 0.1% to 681 Million Euro, Italy shrank by
   11.3% to 200 Million Euro, France dropped 3.9% to 155 Million Euro, UK
   (without Ireland) grew by 4.2% to 155 Million Euro, Eastern Europe by
   4% to 406 Million Euro and Scandinavia by 3% to 207 Million Euro.“

   Georg Steinberger: “As the regional markets are very different in
   structure and customer nature, it is no surprise to see differences as
   described above. In EMS-driven markets in Nordic and Eastern Europe,
   all trends from double-digit growth to double-digit decline are visible
   in Q2, while for example the UK despite all Brexit anxiety holds up
   rather nicely for another quarter. The Italian market on the other hand
   lost 11.3% compared to last year, is negative for the second quarter
   and faces a long, hot summer quarter.”

   At the product level, almost every area turned negative, except some
   selected Power, Sensors, Opto, Analog, Memory and Logic categories.
   Analog products grew 1.5% to 687 Million Euro, MOS Micro shrank 5.6% to
   455 Million Euros, Power grew 2.6% to 258 Million Euros, Memories
   declined 0.8% to 206 Million Euro and Opto lost 8.4% to 203 Million
   Euro. While Programmable Logic dropped by 4% to 147 Million Euro, Other
   Logic grew another staggering 19.3% to 137 Million Euro.

   Georg Steinberger: “Last quarter looks a bit awkward if you compare
   products that are connected through project-driven sales – Analog grows
   while MOS Micro declines, Programmable Logic drops while ASSPs clearly
   explode, Opto and LEDs decline, Sensors grow. If you would pick a real
   setback, it would probably be the disappointing LED business. To be
   noted positively are Power-MOS which have grown to the second-biggest
   product category in distribution, only outperformed by Power
   Management. And Digital Logic is slowly starting to overtake
   Programmable Logic. Comrade Trend says hello…”

   What is ahead for the rest of the year is hard to predict in a shaky
   environment as faced in 2019. Steinberger: “Distribution is well
   positioned, excellently organized and more predictable than the rest of
   the market. It is about time that the real value of what we do for the
   industry is properly recognized by both sides of the supply chain.”

   DMASS Ltd. reports to members only statistics on Interconnect, Passive
   Components, Electromechanical Components and Power Supplies (IPE).
