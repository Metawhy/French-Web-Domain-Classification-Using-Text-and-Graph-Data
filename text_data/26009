   ITC - The First International Conference in Networking Science &
   Practice

ITC 28 in Würzburg

   The evolution of communications and networking is changing the world we
   are living in. The digital connected world is triggered by the
   influence of computer science on telecommunication, the advent of the
   Internet and the massive deployment of mobile communications and
   optics, the appearance of collaborative networking and social networks,
   the ever-increasing speed and flexibility of new communication
   technologies, networks, user devices, and applications, and the
   ever-changing operational challenges arising from this development.
   ITC 28 solicits original contributions that address the latest changes
   and developments in design, modelling, measurement, and performance
   evaluation of communication systems, networks, and services. ITC 28 is
   structured into eight different areas. The objectives in these areas
   include, among others, energy-efficiency and green IT, network security
   and privacy, QoS and QoE, and resilience.

   ITC 28 is technically co-sponsored by IEEE Communications Society (IEEE
   ComSoc) and the Information Technology Society within VDE (ITG VDE),
   and in-cooperation with ACM SIGCOMM. Accepted and presented papers will
   be published in the conference proceedings and submitted to IEEE Xplore
   as well as other Abstracting and Indexing (A&I) databases.

   We are happy to announce the following keynotes: Nikhil Jain (Qualcomm
   Technologies) on Internet of Everything: Engineering Challenges and
   Opportunities; Wolfgang Kellerer (Professor, Communication Networks,
   Technische Universität München) on Towards flexible networking in
   dynamically changing environments; Eitan Altman (INRIA Sophia
   Antipolis, France) on Dynamic games for analyzing competition in the
   Internet.
