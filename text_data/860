The Station game is a first-person narrative mystery set on a space station
sent to study a sentient alien civilization.

   How would you react if we discovered a sentient alien civilization,
   challenging everything we know about biology, chemistry, physics,
   religion and answering the questions man has asked throughout history?

   But what if this sentient alien civilization was discovered in a state
   of civil war?

   Determining that the rewards outweigh the risks, an undetectable space
   station with a small three-person crew deploys to research the alien
   culture in search of a means towards a peaceful relationship.

   Unable to contact the crew, a recon specialist is sent to uncover what
   happened. What players discover will challenge their view of
   surveillance, imperialism and moral law.

   Welcome aboard The Station.

   Axiom, the company leading this space research mission, has commited to
   providing regular updates through their website www.ExploreAxiom.com in
   an effort to keep the public informed. As the pre-mission timeline
   progresses, content will be released leading up to launch of the game
   which gives further insight into the world of The Station. Axiom is
   excited to prepare you for the most significant mission in our people’s
   history.

Dev Update February 7th, 2018

   by admin | Feb 7, 2018 | Uncategorized |

   Hey everyone, welcome to our dev update for February 7th, 2018!

   In less than 2 weeks The Station will be in your hands. There has been
   no time for rest – below is a break down of what we’ve been up to.

   – Last week we completed our release builds for consoles and are doing
   the final dressing for you with testing ongoing right until release.

   – Finishing touches on all of our development documents that we’re
   wanting to make available to you. The one we’re most excited about is
   our game GDD (Game design document) which discusses each decision our
   team made to produce the final version of our game. It’s not often that
   studios will release one of these but you’ll have full access through
   our steam store.

   – Soundtrack mixing. The sounds of The Station are be composed into a
   soundtrack that will ready for download on the steam store as well on
   release day.

   That’s it for our for this update, our next one will be the last before
   our official release! Now that release is close, our team has been
   reflecting over the production process – so we wanted to share a
   comparison shots from early development nearly 3 years ago until now.
   Shots like these are what we discuss in our art book.
