     * Primitive Garden Quilt
       I finally got my “Primitive Garden” Quilt finished after about 2.5
       years!!! I love everything about this quilt and I am so glad that I
       took this challenge on, when I had never even done any wool
       applique projects before!

     * Baby Boy Quilt
       Today I have the fun little Baby Boy Quilt that I quilted on my
       trip to Canada! This was a simple quilt to put together. I did not
       have a pattern…just cut out 5.5″ squares and put them in a design
       and added a couple of borders.

     * Summer Porch
       Today, I decided that I would take you on a tour of my summer
       porch. I love this part of my home and I want it to be a welcoming
       place to all those who come to visit! So, welcome to my summer
       porch!

   June 2019 Ministering Handouts

   School is out here in our neck of the woods and it is supposed to be
   summer…but the weather is not acting like it is summer!  We are still
   having rain and SNOW storms!  Hopefully it will start to warm up soon.
   All the lawns and flowers are loving this cool weather however!

   It is time already for the June 2019 Ministering Handouts!

   This month I actually just recreated a card that I did 7 years ago!!!
   I figured that most of you would not have the same people that you
   ministered to 7 years ago.  Because of that, I changed the message, but
   kept the same general theme. (more…)

   It is time for the May 2019 Ministering Handout.

   I am excited for Spring to finally be coming to our neck of the woods.
   We have wonderfully warm days and then it rains or snows for a day or
   two.

   But…I guess that is what Spring is all about!  At least in Utah!!!

Chevron Rainbow Ribbons Quilt

   Hi everyone!  Hope you are all having a beautiful spring day today!  I
   feel like we are finally starting to get back into a bit of a rhythm.

   We have our little grandson back home and my husband is steadily
   improving…so I feel like there is a light at the end of the tunnel!  I
   want to say thank you to all of you that have send your love and
   prayers.   They were very much appreciated.

   Today I want to show you a quilt that I just finished!  It was a kit
   that I have had for years and I finally pulled it out and put it
   together!

   The name  of this quilt is: Chevron Rainbow Ribbons Quilt
