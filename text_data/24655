Academia Europaea Privacy and Data Protection Policy#

May 2018#

   The Academia Europaea (AE) is a membership organization and a
   registered charity. The AE is a data controller and is committed to
   protecting your personal member data and working in accordance with all
   relevant data protection legislation. Your data is used only for member
   engagement activities, including internal fundraising. This Privacy
   Notice explains how the AE processes and uses the personal data we
   collect about our members.

WHAT DATA DO WE HOLD?#

   The AE may hold data relating to you from a number of sources. The
   majority of data we hold on members is that which you provide either
   during your nomination and election process and during the subsequent
   membership acceptance period, when you complete one of our data forms,
   when you make an annual membership contribution, or make a donation or
   payment for other purposes. or engage with us in any other way for
   example as an invited panel expert.
   Our records may include any/all of the following:
     * Educational and professional academic information

     * Personal identifiers and biographical information – for example
       date of birth, current and past employment, publications and
       research records and similar information and awards, honours and
       other indicators of international standing as an academic.

     * Contact details – institutional and/or private address data, email
       addresses, website URLs, telephone. (all of these are updated
       whenever you tell us about changes)

     * Preference information- how we communicate with you

   We may also augment data you provide, with data which is publicly
   available, for example we may record:
     * Your career details and other achievements taken from your
       institutional/employer public website or personal website, or other
       publically distributed media sources

   By attending the AE events you consent to the use of your photographs
   and/or films on the AE website and for the promotion of AE activities.
   We are required to ensure that data we hold about you is as accurate as
   possible, therefore we may update your details based on reliable
   publicly available sources. For example we may update your address,
   telephone number or business details and email address. We do not
   purchase personal or professional data from third party sources,
   directories or other such media.
   By accepting membership of the AE, and completing the acceptance forms
   you are agreeing to make your personal data available to us for the
   purpose only of maintaining your active membership and for internal
   organizational membership communication purposes. We will retain your
   data until such time that you cease to be a member through resignation.
   We do not keep any personal financial information (such as bank or card
   details) other than a simple record of your annual membership payments
   (amounts and date paid) for the purpose of membership administration.

COOKIES#

   The AE site uses cookies. Information about the cookies we use is
   available at https://cookiesandyou.com .

GOOGLE ANALYTICS#

   by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text files

   site. Google Analytics process your data on the basis of their
   prevailing legitimate interest to cost-efficiently generate easy to use
   website access statistics (Article 6(1)(f) General Data Protection
   Regulation). Privacy Policy for Google Analytics.

HOW DO WE USE YOUR DATA?#

   The AE is an organization of internationally recognized and excellent
   individual academic scholars and researchers that are elected in
   recognition of international excellence in their own fields. As a
   not-for-profit registered charity, we seek to promote scholarship and
   learning and the expertise of our members. The AE therefore primarily
   uses your data to communicate information about the individual
   expertise of members to the wider public, and to enhance the
   collaborative opportunities across disciplines within the organization
   and for the promotion of benefits and services to members. These can
   include:
     * Sending magazines or e-newsletters/letters
     * Inviting members to events
     * Seeking members as leading experts
     * Establishing groups of members for projects and activities
     * Publishing activities
     * Contact for the purpose of annual subscription or fundraising

   These activities may include you being contacted by staff located at
   our HQ office, or from any of our Regional Knowledge Hubs, or by Class
   or Section chairpersons, or by members of our Board of trustees.
   In order to better manage our costs, we now communicate with individual
   members predominately by e-mail and e-newsletter, very occasionally by
   post and rarely by telephone.
   If you do not wish to be contacted at all by any means, please contact
   the Executive Secretary (Execsec@acadeuro.org ). This will have an
   impact for your annual financial contribution and your membership
   status.
   The personal data will be stored for as long as you are a member of AE.

HOW WILL WE SHARE YOUR DATA?#

   Individual member data is accessible only to the individual member and
   also to authorized members as follows: All member data is accessible
   securely to HQ staff and the staff at the Regional Knowledge Hubs and
   Graz Data centre. For specific purposes only or on request to Class
   chairs and the Chairs of our Academic Sections for the purposes
   described above.
   Access is managed by the Graz data controllers and authorised by the
   Executive Secretary. Limited data may be disclosed to other external
   organisations acting as our agents: for example to mailing houses; to
   conference organisers, to publishers, to prize and award committees
   (such as the Nobel Prize organization), to the European Commission for
   the purpose of project work that the AE may be engaged in and any
   contracted partners in such projects.
     * We may share data with other individual members on request and for
       bona fide activity within the scope of the AE mission, duly
       authorised.

     * Data is never shared with other organisations to enable other
       charities to contact individuals in a non-approved manner.

     * The AE DOES NOT sell data, or allow third parties to sell on our
       data where that data has been shared for legitimate and authorised
       purposes.

HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR DATA?#

   Member data is held securely on a membership database that is held at
   and managed by staff at the AE Data centre based at the Technical
   University of Graz. Individual members may access and manage their
   personal data via an account. Other access is as described above. A
   copy of the membership database is held by the HQ office for member
   financial contribution and journal subscription management purposes.
   Only the Executive Secretary and Administrative manager have access to
   this data.

YOUR RIGHTS#

   As a member you have the right to:
     * Ask to see, correct, or delete the data we hold about you

     * Object to specific data uses, as described above

     * Object to receiving communications and direct marketing

     * Ask for the transfer of your data electronically to a third party

     * Withdraw your consent to us processing your data at any time.
       However, this does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on
       your consent before its withdrawal.

   If you ask us to delete your data, this effectively will mean
   resignation from membership. Under these circumstances we will retain a
   skeleton record comprising name, membership number, date of election
   and resignation and the name of the section that you were a member of.
   You will then cease to be contacted in any way by the AE. NO financial
   or other records will be retained.
     * Decide on the scope of communication with Academia Europaea

   Unless you specifically opt-out from receiving any forms of
   communication from the AE, then we will continue to keep you informed
   about the activity of the Academia using our traditional methods of
   E-newsletter/letter; occasional postal mail and very rarely telephone.
   Our electronic newsletters all have the option to unsubscribe from
   receiving future mailings. If you do opt-out from all general mailings
   (through all channels), we will still contact you on an annual basis in
   connection with the membership contributions. You have the option to
   ask to be put to NO MAIL. This effectively makes you an inactive
   member, but you will continue to be listed as member at the publically
   accessible website of Academia Europaea.

OTHER INFORMATION#

   The request for the consent of the data subject is based on the legal
   justification for processing your data according to Article 6 of
   Regulation (EU) 2016/679).
   The legal basis for processing your personal data for the purposes as
   described above is that it is necessary for the pursuit of our
   legitimate interests to support our vision as a registered charity.
   This Privacy Notice will be kept under review. Any changes will be
   posted and updated on our website and you should check this page on a
   regular basis to make sure that you are aware of the latest version.
   The AE Data Protection Officer (DPO) is responsible for monitoring
   compliance with relevant legislation in relation to personal data and
   can be contacted at Execsec@acadeuro.org . You can also contact the DPO
   if you have any queries or concerns about how we process your personal
   data. You have the right to lodge a complaint with the UK Information
   Commissioner’s office at http://www.ico.org.uk/concerns .
   This Privacy Notice was created in May 2018.

Academia Europaea Privacy and Data Protection Policy#

May 2018#

   The Academia Europaea (AE) is a membership organization and a
   registered charity. The AE is a data controller and is committed to
   protecting your personal member data and working in accordance with all
   relevant data protection legislation. Your data is used only for member
   engagement activities, including internal fundraising. This Privacy
   Notice explains how the AE processes and uses the personal data we
   collect about our members.

WHAT DATA DO WE HOLD?#

   The AE may hold data relating to you from a number of sources. The
   majority of data we hold on members is that which you provide either
   during your nomination and election process and during the subsequent
   membership acceptance period, when you complete one of our data forms,
   when you make an annual membership contribution, or make a donation or
   payment for other purposes. or engage with us in any other way for
   example as an invited panel expert.
   Our records may include any/all of the following:
     * Educational and professional academic information

     * Personal identifiers and biographical information – for example
       date of birth, current and past employment, publications and
       research records and similar information and awards, honours and
       other indicators of international standing as an academic.

     * Contact details – institutional and/or private address data, email
       addresses, website URLs, telephone. (all of these are updated
       whenever you tell us about changes)

     * Preference information- how we communicate with you

   We may also augment data you provide, with data which is publicly
   available, for example we may record:
     * Your career details and other achievements taken from your
       institutional/employer public website or personal website, or other
       publically distributed media sources

   By attending the AE events you consent to the use of your photographs
   and/or films on the AE website and for the promotion of AE activities.
   We are required to ensure that data we hold about you is as accurate as
   possible, therefore we may update your details based on reliable
   publicly available sources. For example we may update your address,
   telephone number or business details and email address. We do not
   purchase personal or professional data from third party sources,
   directories or other such media.
   By accepting membership of the AE, and completing the acceptance forms
   you are agreeing to make your personal data available to us for the
   purpose only of maintaining your active membership and for internal
   organizational membership communication purposes. We will retain your
   data until such time that you cease to be a member through resignation.
   We do not keep any personal financial information (such as bank or card
   details) other than a simple record of your annual membership payments
   (amounts and date paid) for the purpose of membership administration.

COOKIES#

   The AE site uses cookies. Information about the cookies we use is
   available at https://cookiesandyou.com .

GOOGLE ANALYTICS#

   The AE website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided
   by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text files
   placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the
   site. Google Analytics process your data on the basis of their
   prevailing legitimate interest to cost-efficiently generate easy to use
   website access statistics (Article 6(1)(f) General Data Protection
   Regulation). Privacy Policy for Google Analytics.

HOW DO WE USE YOUR DATA?#

   The AE is an organization of internationally recognized and excellent
   individual academic scholars and researchers that are elected in
   recognition of international excellence in their own fields. As a
   not-for-profit registered charity, we seek to promote scholarship and
   learning and the expertise of our members. The AE therefore primarily
   uses your data to communicate information about the individual
   expertise of members to the wider public, and to enhance the
   collaborative opportunities across disciplines within the organization
   and for the promotion of benefits and services to members. These can
   include:
     * Sending magazines or e-newsletters/letters
     * Inviting members to events
     * Seeking members as leading experts
     * Establishing groups of members for projects and activities
     * Publishing activities
     * Contact for the purpose of annual subscription or fundraising

   These activities may include you being contacted by staff located at
   our HQ office, or from any of our Regional Knowledge Hubs, or by Class
   or Section chairpersons, or by members of our Board of trustees.
   In order to better manage our costs, we now communicate with individual
   members predominately by e-mail and e-newsletter, very occasionally by
   post and rarely by telephone.
   If you do not wish to be contacted at all by any means, please contact
   the Executive Secretary (Execsec@acadeuro.org ). This will have an
   impact for your annual financial contribution and your membership
   status.
   The personal data will be stored for as long as you are a member of AE.

HOW WILL WE SHARE YOUR DATA?#

   Individual member data is accessible only to the individual member and
   also to authorized members as follows: All member data is accessible
   securely to HQ staff and the staff at the Regional Knowledge Hubs and
   Graz Data centre. For specific purposes only or on request to Class
   chairs and the Chairs of our Academic Sections for the purposes
   described above.
   Access is managed by the Graz data controllers and authorised by the
   Executive Secretary. Limited data may be disclosed to other external
   organisations acting as our agents: for example to mailing houses; to
   conference organisers, to publishers, to prize and award committees
   (such as the Nobel Prize organization), to the European Commission for
   the purpose of project work that the AE may be engaged in and any
   contracted partners in such projects.
     * We may share data with other individual members on request and for
       bona fide activity within the scope of the AE mission, duly
       authorised.

     * Data is never shared with other organisations to enable other
       charities to contact individuals in a non-approved manner.

     * The AE DOES NOT sell data, or allow third parties to sell on our
       data where that data has been shared for legitimate and authorised
       purposes.

HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR DATA?#

   Member data is held securely on a membership database that is held at
   and managed by staff at the AE Data centre based at the Technical
   University of Graz. Individual members may access and manage their
   personal data via an account. Other access is as described above. A
   copy of the membership database is held by the HQ office for member
   financial contribution and journal subscription management purposes.
   Only the Executive Secretary and Administrative manager have access to
   this data.

YOUR RIGHTS#

   As a member you have the right to:
     * Ask to see, correct, or delete the data we hold about you

     * Object to specific data uses, as described above

     * Object to receiving communications and direct marketing

     * Ask for the transfer of your data electronically to a third party

     * Withdraw your consent to us processing your data at any time.
       However, this does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on
       your consent before its withdrawal.

   If you ask us to delete your data, this effectively will mean
   resignation from membership. Under these circumstances we will retain a
   skeleton record comprising name, membership number, date of election
   and resignation and the name of the section that you were a member of.
   You will then cease to be contacted in any way by the AE. NO financial
   or other records will be retained.
     * Decide on the scope of communication with Academia Europaea

   Unless you specifically opt-out from receiving any forms of
   communication from the AE, then we will continue to keep you informed
   about the activity of the Academia using our traditional methods of
   E-newsletter/letter; occasional postal mail and very rarely telephone.
   Our electronic newsletters all have the option to unsubscribe from
   receiving future mailings. If you do opt-out from all general mailings
   (through all channels), we will still contact you on an annual basis in
   connection with the membership contributions. You have the option to
   ask to be put to NO MAIL. This effectively makes you an inactive
   member, but you will continue to be listed as member at the publically
   accessible website of Academia Europaea.

OTHER INFORMATION#

   The request for the consent of the data subject is based on the legal
   justification for processing your data according to Article 6 of
   Regulation (EU) 2016/679).
   The legal basis for processing your personal data for the purposes as
   described above is that it is necessary for the pursuit of our
   legitimate interests to support our vision as a registered charity.
   This Privacy Notice will be kept under review. Any changes will be
   posted and updated on our website and you should check this page on a
   regular basis to make sure that you are aware of the latest version.
   The AE Data Protection Officer (DPO) is responsible for monitoring
   compliance with relevant legislation in relation to personal data and
   can be contacted at Execsec@acadeuro.org . You can also contact the DPO
   if you have any queries or concerns about how we process your personal
   data. You have the right to lodge a complaint with the UK Information
   Commissioner’s office at http://www.ico.org.uk/concerns .
   This Privacy Notice was created in May 2018.
