Welcome to CHI 2010

   CHI (ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems) is the
   premier international conference for the field of human-computer
   interaction. CHI 2010 looks outward to the human experience of
   computing in the world. “We are HCI” challenges our community to
   embrace the diversity of HCI in the world and to exclaim our commitment
   as a profession to empower people from all walks of life.

   CHI 2010 will be held in Atlanta, Georgia, home of the 1996 Summer
   Olympics. Atlanta, “the capital of the New South,” has a vibrant
   heritage in the civil rights movement as “the city too busy to hate”
   and is the home to many influential institutions such as The Carter
   Center, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CARE and wide
   range of business giants including Coca-Cola and Turner Broadcasting.
   With over 4 million metro residents, Atlanta offers a wide range of
   cultural, recreational and entertainment activities, and hosts more
   than 38 million visitors each year.

   Atlanta is the home to many researchers, designers, teachers, artists
   and practitioners who share a commitment to the human experience of
   computing: Georgia Tech and its GVU Center, SCAD Atlanta, Emory,
   Spelman College, Turner Broadcasting and CNN, The Carter Center, CARE,
   CDC, IBM, Philips, Moxie Interactive, Roundarch, Matter, Big Bang to
   name a few...

   Come explore “we are HCI” as Atlanta opens its doors to CHI 2010.
