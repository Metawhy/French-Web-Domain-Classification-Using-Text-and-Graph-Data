       Customer Care

Interactions drive transactions
       The web was designed for content-sharing but not for commerce. 90%
       of consumers start research and shopping online, but less than 15%
       of sales happen online. Consumers need to ask questions, get
       advice, and understand options before they make purchases.
       Conversational commerce makes this possible without having to visit
       a store or place a call. And the results have been incredible.

Capitalize on every customer care conversation
       The majority of our day-to-day conversations happen in messaging
       channels like SMS and Facebook Messenger — it's how we prefer to
       communicate with friends and family. So it's not a surprise 8 out
       of 10 consumers choose messaging over voice to get support or
       service after they buy something.
