With homebrews and hacksDiscover games never released on console

   Homebrews are games entirely created by independant developers. Many
   are unexpected surprises, and will make you have a great time!

   Hacks are modified original games. They keep all, or just parts of the
   graphics and gameplay of a game and differ in the story, the difficulty
   and the atmosphere. Some are considered full-fledged, original games
   like 'Super Mario Bros. 4' (hack of Super Mario World), or 'The Legend
   Of Zelda - Parallels Worlds' (hack of 'A link to the past')
