A community event at Amel center highlighting the importance of a healthy
childhood and psycho-social well-being

   In the framework of the Child Protection Program at Amel Association in
   partnership with UNICEF, a community event was held in Hay El Sellom
   Development center, where the  psycho-social activities of this program
   are taking place since 2015.

   The event gathered 203 children, focusing mainly on child rights in
   parallel with awareness sessions with 55 caregivers on positive
   parenting, and child development.

   Different fun activities were organized with the children, giving them
   a space to express themselves, and learn about child rights through art
   and educational games.

   Child protection projects implemented by Amel and its partners focus on
   a psycho-social activities with children aged 6-16, as well as their
   caregivers aiming at engendering social behavioral change on a
   community level. This project aims at protecting children and
   caregivers from all types of violence, including early marriage and
   child labor by providing them with the knowledge and tolls necessary to
   become primary actors in their own protection. During 2018, 3660
   children benefited from PSS activities across Amel centers.

   Community-based psycho-social support activities for Syrian and
   Lebanese children are currently taking place in 5 Amel centers in the
   areas of Beirut and North and West Beqaa.

   Why child protection?

   A famous quote by Dr. Kamel Mohanna president of Amel Association
   International says: “children have the right to protection. They have
   the right to survive, to be safe, to belong, to be heard, to receive
   adequate care and to grow up in a protective environment”. Indeed, The
   issue of child protection, in areas of conflict, and developing
   countries, poses a real threat to the development of both refugee and
   host population children.

   Refugee and vulnerable children face a number of protection risks-
   including abuse, neglect, exploitation and discrimination. Children as
   young as 7 are engaged in child labor instead of going to school and
   living their childhood, largely due to their families’ socio-economic
   situation. In effect, 22% of Syrian refugees ages 5-17 are engaged in
   child labor in Lebanon as well as 7% of Lebanese children within the
   same age.

   Amel’s child protection program engages in a holistic approach to try
   and tackle child labor by targeting the family as a whole: This entails
   efforts to stop the child from working, giving them access to
   psycho-social support as well as supporting their caregivers to access
   income generating opportunities.
