   David Gungor and John Arndt, the band The Brilliance, will play live at
   the American Church in Paris on Saturday, 19 October at 20h joining an
   expanded string quartet and choir from our ACP community. Their
   eclectic songs combine symphonic, classical, pop and electronic
   elements to explore issues of social justice and inspire reflection and
   connection with others. They will perform songs from their latest
   album, Suite No. 1 Oh Dreamer which was inspired by the stories of
   immigrants known as “dreamers” in the U.S., pieces from their yet un-
   released album Suite no. 2 The World Keeps on Spinning and well-loved
   favorites such as their peace-making opus Brother. A champagne and cake
   reception will follow in the Theatre. Our very own Devon Graves will
   open for The Brilliance. Don’t miss this very special evening!

   Acclaimed across the U.S. for their thoughtful, relevant, eclectic
   spiritual protest music, David Gungor and John Arndt cross the genres
   of classical and pop, electronic and acoustic, exploring the creative
   imagination and the power of beauty to evoke empathy that leads to
   Christ-like action in the world.

   David Gungor is a singer, songwriter and guitarist based in New York
   City where he also serves as a pastor at Trinity Grace Tribeca. He is
   married with four children. John Arndt is a classical pianist, producer
   and composer, and has performed all over the world in a wide variety of
   venues and musical styles. They created The Brilliance in 2010,
   crafting music that gives listeners “time and space to fully soak in
   the beauty that lies in every lyric and sonic nuance.”

   Got questions about life? Try the Alpha Course

   Course (10 weeks): Thursdays, beginning 26 September at 19h00 in the
   Thurber Room










   Ever wanted to explore the meaning of life or ask challenging questions
   about the Christian faith? Do you have a family member, friend,
   neighbor or colleague who is asking questions about life? If you've
   answered "yes" then the Alpha Course is for you!

   Alpha is an opportunity for anyone to explore the Christian faith in a
   relaxed, informal and friendly way. It welcomes all those big questions
   – and it's free!

   The course will run every Thursday from 26 September for 10 weeks.
   Using the latest video talks by Nicky Gumbel (in English with French
   subtitles), each session starts with a meal at 19h followed by a short
   video looking at different aspects of the Christian faith, with topics
   such as How can I have faith? and Does God heal today? Afterwards there
   are small group discussions, where you can talk about what you have
   heard and ask any questions you might have.

   No question is too simple or too hostile!! Whether you've never heard
   of God, you're someone who has recently come to faith or you have been
   a Christian all of your life, this course is for you! Even if you've
   been a Christian for many years, Alpha is a great way to remind
   yourself about the fundamental aspects of faith and it is also perfect
   to invite friends to who are seeking answers about life...so why not
   invite them to come along with you?

All-Church Fall Retreat 2019

   Run Away: The Gospel According to Jonah
   25-27 October 2019

   Fall Retreat 201



   (BUTTON) Purchase Tickets
   Buy Tickets on Eventbrite


   Why are you running? Jonah was a prophet of God (good guy). Nineveh was
   the hated enemy (bad guys). Isn't it nice when the world is divided up
   and ordered so neatly? In this great divide between good and evil, the
   answer to all our problems is so simple. It's THEIR fault. THEY should
   be punished. THEY need to change.

   But what happens when the prophet of God starts to misbehave and run
   from God? And what happens when the bad guys do something good? Uh oh,
   maybe its time to move onto a different story.

   Honestly, sometimes these messy stories about complex people and
   situations can hit a little too close to home. In fact, the Biblical
   prophets are quite skilled at hitting close to home. So much so that
   even if you don't like to run, going for a jog (far away from these
   irritating stories) might start to sound like a good idea.

   So if we're going to run, a retreat (which literally means to run away)
   might be a good place for all of us.

   Join us for our All-Church Fall Retreat (25-27 October 2019) led by
   Pastor Tim Vance. This will be a good time to get away from the city,
   connect with God and with one another, relax, play, eat and maybe even
   allow the story of Jonah to inspire deeper reflections and
   conversations about all our experiences of running.

   ALL ARE WELCOME. Programs are being developed for children and adults.

   SPACE IS LIMITED SO REGISTER EARLY!

   Cost
   The retreat will cost €125 for adults, €100 for Young Adults, €140 for
   an adult and child, €250 for a family (2 adults and up to 2 children)
   and €40 for an additional child. There is an additional €25 charge if
   you would like a single room. The price includes all meals, 2 nights’
   accommodation, sheets, and shuttle from the St. Prix station. Please do
   not let money keep you from joining us for this retreat.
   Half-Scholarships are available.

   Fall Retreat 2017 When
   Friday Evening (25 October) – Sunday Afternoon (27 October)

   Where
   Massabielle Retreat Center, 1 Rue Auguste Rey, 95390 Saint Prix

   Who
   Everyone! This is an All Church Fall Retreat with programs for children
   and adults.

   service; the 11h00 service is a traditional service with special music

   established in 1857. We have been located on the quai d’Orsay since
   1931.

   The American Church today is an important part of life in Paris for
   many people.

   Providing spiritual guidance, education, and a strong sense of
   community and belonging, the ACP serves a diverse population:
     * Thousands of people use the church facilities as a community center
       for various classes and meetings.
     * More than 35 Christian denominations are represented in the Church.
     * More than 40 nationalities are represented in the Church
       membership.

       Study Fellowship, occasional lecture series, a free weekly concert
       series, and many more community-based services and events.
     * We desire to grow as a learning and loving community.

    We hope that you will visit us and that we may serve you during your
   time in Paris. May God’s grace, mercy and peace be with you!

Bloom Where You’re Planted — 2019

   Saturday 5 October

   Bloom Where You're Planted is a full-day orientation seminar designed
   to help you make the most of your new life in Paris. Created for
   English-speaking expats from around the world, this seminar provides
   valuable insights that will enable you and your family to grow and
   thrive, as well as opportunities for meaningful connections with your
   new community in the City of Light.

   The day will feature keynote speakers and focused seminars offering
   inspiration and information on topics such as acclimating to the
   culture, finding the perfect home, navigating the education and
   healthcare systems, creating a successful business, cooking like the
   French, and more!

   In our extensive Exhibit Hall you will connect with organizations and
   businesses offering opportunities and services for the expat community.
   And, of course, an introduction to Parisian life wouldn’t be complete
   without delicious food and wine as our day culminates with a wine
   tasting and networking party.

   Childcare and a kids program will be available for children ages 6
   months to 12 years.

   Planted – Tips for Living in France. This full day seminar, designed to
   assist English-speaking newcomers to France, features speakers and/or
   workshops on various topics from food and wine tasting to health care
   and general safety, need-to-know subjects, and just plain fun facts
   about France. Bloom helps with understanding cultural differences,
   creating a new life in Paris, and getting connected with friends and
   organizations throughout Paris and the surrounding areas.

   The Bloom book, Bloom Where You’re Planted, Tips for Living in France,
   has been updated and reprinted regularly since 1965, and has become the
   “must have” book for all English-speaking expats in France. Even if
   you’re an old hand at living in France, you’re bound to learn new
   things from the Bloom Book.

   bloom Attendance at Bloom includes:

   - exciting talks presented by expert speakers
   - a light breakfast and strong coffee
   - a delicious lunch
   - wine and cheese reception
   - book signings
   - networking opportunities
   - a gift bag with give-aways and useful information
   - copy of the Bloom Book

   The Bloom program has become the premier source of information for
   English-speaking expats in France. Whether you've been living in France
   for some time already or have just arrived, you’ll enjoy Bloom Where
   You're Planted.

   Don’t Just survive... Thrive!

   David Gungor and John Arndt, the band The Brilliance, will play live at
   the American Church in Paris on Saturday, 19 October at 20h joining an
   expanded string quartet and choir from our ACP community. Their
   eclectic songs combine symphonic, classical, pop and electronic
   elements to explore issues of social justice and inspire reflection and
   connection with others. They will perform songs from their latest
   album, Suite No. 1 Oh Dreamer which was inspired by the stories of
   immigrants known as “dreamers” in the U.S., pieces from their yet un-
   released album Suite no. 2 The World Keeps on Spinning and well-loved
   favorites such as their peace-making opus Brother. A champagne and cake
   reception will follow in the Theatre. Our very own Devon Graves will
   open for The Brilliance. Don’t miss this very special evening!

   Acclaimed across the U.S. for their thoughtful, relevant, eclectic
   spiritual protest music, David Gungor and John Arndt cross the genres
   of classical and pop, electronic and acoustic, exploring the creative
   imagination and the power of beauty to evoke empathy that leads to
   Christ-like action in the world.

   David Gungor is a singer, songwriter and guitarist based in New York
   City where he also serves as a pastor at Trinity Grace Tribeca. He is
   married with four children. John Arndt is a classical pianist, producer
   and composer, and has performed all over the world in a wide variety of
   venues and musical styles. They created The Brilliance in 2010,
   crafting music that gives listeners “time and space to fully soak in
   the beauty that lies in every lyric and sonic nuance.”

   subtitles), each session starts with a meal at 19h followed by a short
   video looking at different aspects of the Christian faith, with topics
   such as How can I have faith? and Does God heal today? Afterwards there
   are small group discussions, where you can talk about what you have
   heard and ask any questions you might have.

   No question is too simple or too hostile!! Whether you've never heard
   of God, you're someone who has recently come to faith or you have been
   a Christian all of your life, this course is for you! Even if you've
   been a Christian for many years, Alpha is a great way to remind
   yourself about the fundamental aspects of faith and it is also perfect
   to invite friends to who are seeking answers about life...so why not
   invite them to come along with you?

   For more information, please feel free to contact the Alpha team here.
   Make sure that you keep up-to-date with details about the Launch Party
   and the course by checking the ACP website and social media channels.


   What people said about Alpha on the last course at ACP:

   alpha1

   "Since doing Alpha I have started Bible reading. Using the verses
   spoken about it has been great to go away and read them for
   myself...work at them with a deeper understanding"

   "Great food, great atmosphere, great discussions"

   "I came here as a non-believer and now I think that life without God
   and faith makes no sense"

   "The videos were theologically rich and stimulated great discussions"

   "I enjoyed sharing and learning from others"

   "I have a better understanding of the relationship with Jesus Christ
   and I have hope"

   29 million people around the world have done Alpha – have you?
