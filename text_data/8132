   Our Mission

   Story Book Farm is a place of safety. We offer freedom from fear. We
   are a place of healing and recovery from trauma. We believe that all
   animals have rights; that animals have the right to live free of fear
   or pain from humans, in any form;  and that we can all make a
   difference, one being at a time. In sanctuary care, we encourage
   friendships between our residents. We encourage exploration and freedom
   of choice. We give back the ability to make decisions and control
   events that affect residents' lives.

   As of 2019-04-23, we are home to 19 monkeys who have come to us for
   peace and solace from a variety of backgrounds, some of them with
   stories difficult even to share, let alone survive.

   Won't you join us in our mission? Donate or volunteer today! The
   rewards are immeasurable.

   Thank you to everyone who has supported us in the past.  We hope you
   will continue to do so in the future, and spread the word so that our
   community of supporters continues to grow!

Story Book: The Next Chapter

   Story Book Farm Primate Sanctuary has long been the home of monkeys,
   each  with their own heart-wrenching story.  It is now necessary to
   expand.  The demand continues as we learn of monkeys needing sanctuary
   - monkeys that are being kept inhumanely in roadside zoos, monkeys that
   are being bred for the exotic pet trade and, most recently, research
   monkeys. In a precedent-setting move, Story Book Farm is now home to
   the first lab monkeys to be allowed to retire after surviving their
   research obligations. We want to provide the best long-term captive
   care to monkeys who have had their wild lives stolen.

   In order to take in more monkeys - we already have a waiting list of
   two - we need to expand.  This plan to build a new sustainable
   structure and extensive outdoor areas will cost $1million.

   See our press release here , and our fund-raising campaign here.

   Watch our campaign launch video.

   $154,940 raised as of 2019-10-02.  Only 90 days to go to raise $845,060
   more.

Donations are always welcome

   Big heart but short on time? We are privately funded and volunteer run,

   and effort, are always welcome. We take construction materials, food
   donations, toys, services and more!

   For ways to donate, please visit our Donations page .

Host a Third Party Event

What is a ‘Third-Party’ event?

   A Third-Party Event is a fundraising event held by a group, company or
   organization to support the work of Story Book Farm Primate Sanctuary.
   It could be a BBQ, garage sale, art show, walk/run event, baseball
   tournament, etc.

   Each year we depend on the generosity and hard work of many community
   event planners to help us continue to meet our goal of providing a
   permanent and peaceful haven for primates retiring from biomedical
   research, zoos, universities, pet stores, and private residences, and
   advocate for the well-being of these and all other animals through
   education.

Who can host a ‘Third-Party’ event?

   Any individual, group, company or organization that would like to
   support Story Book Farm Primate Sanctuary. Anyone can organize a
   community fundraising activity. Get your workplace, school, friends and
   family involved - the possibilities are endless!

What kind of events can we hold?

   Almost any kind. Your imagination is the limit!

   Here are some other examples of creative and effective community
   fundraising activities:
     * School/Business Dress Down Days
     * Dinner Dance/ Concert/ Garden Tour/ Homes Tour/ Art Show/ Boat
       Cruise
     * Car Wash/ Garage Sale/Bake Sale
     * Silent Auction or 50/50 Raffle
     * Jewellery (or the like) Party
     * Donations in lieu of gifts (e.g. birthday, wedding)
     * A-Thons Walk, skip, read, bike, dance, knit, swim, skate
     * Sporting Events and Tournaments Baseball/football/Soccer game, golf
       or tennis tournament,
     * Fishing derby pool/billiards/darts/wii tournament

   Would you like to help?

   Please consider hosting a third party fundraising event on our behalf.
   Contact us and we will be happy to help. Hosting a Third Party Event is
   a great way to distinguish yourself as a community leader, and make a
   positive difference in a great many lives. No event is too big or too
   small! With all Third Party Events, a portion or all of the proceeds
   may be given to Story Book Farm Primate Sanctuary.

   For more information on hosting an event on behalf of Story Book Farm
   Primate Sanctuary, please contact Suzanne Boucher at (416) 671-3012.

Become an Advocate

   discussions on global conservation whenever we give public talks to
   schools or other groups. We also directly help these animals by
   providing them with daily care and enrichment. We encourage you to find
   out what ignites that passion within you, and contact us if you’d like
   to volunteer. Whether it be fundraising, marketing, advocacy, animal
   care, contracting/building, materials supplying, we can use any and all
   of your skills!

   organizations. Please see our Resources page  or contact us to find out
