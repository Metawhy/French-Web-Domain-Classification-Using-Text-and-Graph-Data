Privacy Policy

   Effective: May 10, 2019

1 - Introduction

   Welcome to FrontApp, Inc. (“FrontApp”, "we", "us" and "our"). FrontApp
   provides software and services that unify your email, customer
   communication channels, and apps in one platform, helping teammates
   work better together.

   The “Websites” means Front’s websites (including without limitation
   www.frontapp.com, app.frontapp.com and any successor URLS, mobile or
   localized versions and related domains and subdomains), and the
   “Services” means FrontApp’s products, applications and services, in
   each case in whatever format they may be offered now or in the future.

2 - Purpose of this Privacy Policy

   The purpose of this “Privacy Policy” is to inform you of the type of
   personal data we collect when you use our Services, why we collect the
   data, how it is used and your rights and choices. If you do not agree
   with this Privacy Policy, do not access or use our Services.

3 - Personal Data We Collect

   Personal Data that you provide to us. When you register for a FrontApp
   account you are required to provide certain basic contact information,
   such as your name, and email address, and telephone number. If you
   choose to register for an account utilizing your credentials from a
   third party service (such as Google or Microsoft), then your name and
   email address will be provided to us as permitted by your profile
   settings within that third party service. If you are registering for a
   paid account you will also be required to provide payment information,
   such as payment card details (collected by our payment service
   provider), Single Sign On(SSO) SAML 2.0 credentials as well as other
   information that you voluntarily choose to add to your account profile,
   like a profile photo or a birth date. We will inform you, when
   requesting your Personal Data, if certain data must be provided or if
   it is optional. We will also inform you of the consequences should you
   not wish to provide this data.
   We also collect the information that you may choose to submit to our
   customer support team, for example regarding a problem you are
   experiencing with our Services. This may include your contact
   information, a summary of the problem you are experiencing, and any
   other documentation or information that would be helpful in resolving
   the issue.

   Automatically collected data. When you interact with FrontApp through
   the Services, we automatically collect information about you through
   cookies (small text files placed on your device), mobile device
   identifier and other technologies. Please read the “Cookies” section
   below to learn more about how we use cookies and other technologies.
   When you visit our Websites, our servers record information (“log
   data”), including information that your browser automatically sends
   whenever you visit the Website. This log data includes your Internet
   Protocol (“IP”) address (from which we understand the country you are
   connecting from at the time you visit the Site), browser type and
   settings, the date and time of your request.

   Data from other services you link to your account: In order to perform
   tasks that are part of the Services we require you to integrate your
   third party email service with your Services account. Doing so provides
   us with access to your email account(s) and the content included
   therein. You authorize this access by agreeing to this Privacy Policy
   and providing any consent required by your email provider. We receive
   information about you when you or your administrator integrate or link
   a third-party service with our Services. For example, if you create an
   account or log into our Services using your Google or Microsoft
   credentials, we receive your name and email address as permitted by
   your Google or Microsoft profile settings in order to authenticate you.
   You or your administrator may also integrate other third party services
   you use with and into our Services. For example, you may authorize our
   Services to access and display messages from within an instant
   messaging application, or to access and display files from a
   third-party document sharing service. The information we receive when
   you integrate our Services with a third-party service depends on the
   settings, permissions and privacy policy associated with that
   third-party service. Please check the privacy settings and privacy
   policy of these third-party services to understand what data may be
   disclosed to and shared with us.

4. How We Use Personal Data

   We collect Personal Data for the following purposes:

   To provide the Services and manage your access to and use of the
   Services: We use information about you to provide the Services to you,
   including to register you for the Services, process transactions with
   you, authenticate you when you log in, provide customer support, and
   operate and maintain the Services.

   To communicate with you about the Services and provide you with
   customer support: We use your contact information to communicate with
   you about the Services, respond to your customer support questions and
   requests, and to provide you notices regarding the Services (including
   notices about your account, product update announcements, security
   alerts, administrative notifications and the like). In connection with
   providing you with customer support, we may also use the information we
   automatically collect and information that you provide to us and
   consent for us to view and utilize as part of a support request so that
   we can respond to your request, analyze information related to your
   support request, and to repair or improve the Services. We may also
   provide you with tailored communications that are based on your
   interactions with the Services. For example, certain actions you take
   may trigger a third-party app suggestion or we may communicate with you
   as you begin using the Services to assist you as you learn to be
   proficient in your use of the Services. These communications are
   fundamental to the Services and in most cases you cannot opt out of
   them. If an opt out is available, you will find information about how
   to opt out in the communication itself or in your account settings.

   For research and development: So that we can continually improve the
   functionality of our Services, we utilize our collective learnings
   about the way users interact with and use the Services, as well as
   feedback provided directly to us, to troubleshoot issues, fix bugs,
   enhance functionality, and identify areas for integration and
   improvement of the Services.

   To market and promote our Services: We use your contact information and
   information about how you use the Services to communicate directly with
   you, including by sending you newsletters, promotions or information
   about current and future products and services. You may opt out of
   receiving such communications at any time by (i) clicking the
   unsubscribe link included in all the emails you receive or (ii)
   contacting us as indicated in Section 12 below (“Contact”).

   For safety and security: We use information about you and the way in
   which you use the Services to verify accounts and activity, monitor for
   suspicious or fraudulent activity and identify violations of our
   Services policies.

   To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights: Where
   required by law, or where we think it is necessary to protect our legal
   rights and interests or the legal rights and interests of others, we
   use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance
   and regulatory functions. If you ask us to delete your data or to be
   removed from our marketing lists and we are required to fulfill your
   request, we will keep basic data to identify you and prevent further
   unwanted processing.
   As used above, “legitimate interests” means our interests in conducting
   our business, managing and delivering the best Services to you. We will
   not use your Personal Data for activities where the impact on you
   overrides our interests, unless we have your consent or those
   activities are otherwise required or permitted by law.

   With your consent: We use Personal Data about you where you have given
   us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above. For
   example, with your permission we may publish testimonials or featured
   customer stories on our Websites to promote the Services, including
   names and profile photo of representatives of our customers alongside
   the testimonial.
   While providing our Services, we may collect on behalf of our customers
   information related to our customers’ employees, customers and other
   individuals. Our use of information on behalf of our customers is
   governed by our contract with the applicable customer and the
   customer’s own privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy
   policies or privacy practices of customers or other third parties.

8 - Data Retention

   8.1 - General Provisions

   FrontApp may retain your Personal Data for a period of time consistent
   with the original purpose of collection. For instance, we may retain
   your Personal Data during the time you have an account to use our
   Websites or Services, or as agreed in our subscription agreements, and
   for a reasonable period of time thereafter. We also may retain your
   Personal Data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to
   establish proof of a right or a contract, resolve disputes, enforce our
   agreements, in accordance with the law.

   8.2 - Provisions specific to credit card information

   Your credit card information is stored no longer than the time
   necessary to allow the fulfillment of the transaction, except in the
   case of a subscription, to facilitate the payment of regular customers.
   In that case, credit card information is stored for the whole duration
   of your subscription and at least until the date at which you carry out
   your last transaction. Such storage is implemented by our secured
   payment service provider Stripe.

   By subscribing to our Services, you agree to this storage. Data
   relating to the visual cryptogram or CVV2 on the back of your credit
   card is not stored. In the case of a payment by credit card, however,
   data relating to the credit card may be stored as intermediary archives
   for evidence purpose in the case of possible disputes regarding the
   transaction, for the duration provided by article L.133–24 of the
   French Monetary and Financial Code, i.e. 13 months from the debit date.
   This duration may be extended to 15 months, to take into account the
   possible use of delayed debit card.

9 - Data Security

   We take all necessary precautions, as well as appropriate
   organizational and technical measures, to maintain the security,
   integrity and confidentiality of your Personal Data, and in particular
   to prevent it from being altered or damaged and to prevent any
   unauthorized third party from accessing it. We also use secured payment
   systems consistent with the state of the art and the applicable laws
   and regulations.
