Joyful Self-Portraits

   Hopefully, it has been a few weeks and teachers feel back in the swing
   of things. September is time for creating a classroom community. Many
   of the teachers in my building celebrate the month by making
   self-portraits. Check out some of the beautiful children below!

   We have student's outline with a pencil and go over it with a Sharpie.
   The last part is to color with pencils, markers or paint.

   Jessica had her student's paint on a canvas and hung them up with
   Command hooks(easy for next year). She got the canvases for a great
   price at Michael's.

   Amy had her students draw, outline and color. She pasted them on a
   color background and cut out their names.

   Katie had parents guess their child at Back to School night. I like how
   she didn't laminate them. Simple yet beautiful. She puts these in their
   school portfolio.

   Hopefully, your finding a place in your class to celebrate the faces of
   your students.
   A great big thanks goes out to any teacher who nominated Joyful
   Learning for a top kindergarten blog ❤❤

Happy Friday

   My favorite things this week!
   [IMG_3213.JPG]
    During Interactive Writing this kindergarten class listed their Super
   Reader Powers!!
   [IMG_3229.JPG]
   We had extra bubbles and decided to let the kids write what SUPER POWER
   they are working on.  It's so important for kids to have
   individual goals (even in kindergarten)!
   [IMG_3275.JPG]
   [IMG_3276.JPG]
   [IMG_3232.jpg]
   What am I working on as a writer today? This teacher found it helpful
   to give her student's a few choices.
   [IMG_0762.jpg]
   What are we learning about from favorite authors?

   A first-grade teacher getting ready to conference with students about
   nonfiction text. Below are some teaching possibilities.
