UK Dating: Start Looking in the Right Place

   Regardless of whether you live in London, Edinburgh, Cardiff or
   Manchester, EliteSingles can help you find the long-term relationship
   you’ve been looking for. It may often seem difficult to find your dream
   partner in the UK, but we recognise that our members shouldn't have to
   compromise when it comes to love – including how far they travel to
   find it. There may be more singles than ever before across the UK, but
   it’s all too easy to miss them in the bustle of modern life. To find
   someone with whom you really click, it's all about looking in the right
   place.

   People who join EliteSingles for UK dating aren't interested in
   short-term dating or flings; they share a commitment to finding a true,
   loving, lasting relationship with someone they really get along with.
   The majority of our users are educated, single professionals aged
   30-55, and serious about their search for a partner. If this sounds
   like the kind of person you've been looking for, join them today and
   register to see your matches.

UK dating with EliteSingles

   For a country of relatively small proportions, the UK is a brilliantly
   diverse and bustling country. From Liverpool to London, our vibrant
   multiculturalism sets us apart from the rest of Europe. Yet it’s not
   all good in this country of opportunity; it’s not uncommon to hear
   British singles talk about having to sacrifice their romantic life to
   focus on their career, or struggling to find time to meet new people in
   the frantic buzz of city-life. It's little surprise that increasing
   numbers are now turning online to find love. Our members come from
   everywhere in the UK, so if you’re looking to find a partner locally,
   you can find them with us.

Compatibility is what counts

   Real compatibility is what matters most for loving, long-term
   relationships. But real compatibility doesn’t mean simply pairing
   people with similar interests. Both of you living for outdoor sports
   might be a great thing to share together, yet it might not be enough to
   ensure you get through some of the more testing times in your lives.

   At EliteSingles we think that compatibility runs deeper than that. For
   love that lasts, it’s important that your personalities also sing from
   the same hymn sheet. We also know that our members may be busy, and
   simply don’t have the time to wade through the profiles of singles they
   know won’t suit them in the long-term. Instead, we help to introduce
   you to the most suitable singles on our site.

   We make it happen using a two-part Smart Profiling System which
   considers both your search preferences as well as your personality. For
   this we use a detailed personality questionnaire, based on ‘The Big
   Five’ model of psychology personality traits, which situates you on a
   scale of extraversion, agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness and
   neuroticism.

   While we think compatibility personalities matter, naturally you’ve
   probably an idea of what your ideal type is, or what sort of things
   you’re definitely looking for in a partner. When you register, we
   therefore also ask members to tell us about their preferences on things
   like their ideal partner’s age, distance, desire for children, drinking
   habits and more. These preferemces help to ensure those you meet on the
   site match with both your dating deal-breakers and your personality.
   This means you can be confident in having a real connection, with real
   long-term potential, with those we introduce you to on the site.

Moving your communication offline

   With an EliteSingles introduction you can be confident in getting along
   well. Yet as close a match as a couple might seem on paper, it’s always
   that mysterious, often elusive ‘chemistry’ that ultimately decides if a
   good online connection works in the flesh.

   Your first date with EliteSingles is a big step the dating process.
   Luckily with us you’ve got little to fear; not only are you likely to
   be a great fit if you’ve met through us, but we offer a host of advice
   in our online magazine top help your date go smoothly. From ideal date
   locations to psychological body language advice, you can read it all
   here.

   Still looking for a UK dating site that works? At EliteSingles we’re
   committed to helping all our members find the relationships they
   deserve. Register today and find yours now.

   EliteSingles › About us

About us

   EliteSingles is brought to you by Spark Networks Services GmbH, one of
   Europe’s leading online matchmaking providers. Founded in 2008 in
   Berlin, (former Affinitas) launched its first online dating portal
   eDarling in Germany in May 2009. Today, the company has earned the
   trust of more than 13 million singles, creating thousands of couples
   every month in over 20 countries worldwide.

   EliteSingles is a partnership service designed for UK singles looking
   for a long-term commitment. Our smart profiling delivers compatible
   partner suggestions in line with your personal search preferences, and
   manually verify all new profiles to ensure users have a smooth, safe
   environment in which to meet other like-minded singles.

   Our vision is to maintain the industry's highest standards – to be the
   dating site as committed as our members are to finding love.  Numerous
   certifications and awards testify how successful we already are in this
   area. Nevertheless, the most important indicator of the value of our
   work is, and will always remain, the couples that meet each other
   through our platforms on a daily basis.

Our Matching Process

   The EliteSingles matching process introduces members on the basis of an
   initial personality questionnaire and your individual search
   preferences. We curate the site by manually verifying all profiles,
   automatically removing inactive members, and proactively removing users
   we suspect are not serious. This means our members have a smooth
   browsing experience and can focus on dating.

   The EliteSingles personality profile is based on the “Big Five” model
   of personality psychology. Initially developed in the 1990s, it is one
   of the most important and renowned concepts in modern psychology. Using
   the results of five personality dimensions, we are able to identify
   couples who are particularly well suited to a long and happy
   relationship together. Then, if the couple's demographic data and
   personal preferences are also a match, the two members are suggested to
   each other.

   The demographic data we consider includes gender, age, residence,
   profession and level of education. Additionally, in order to match
   personal preferences we explore various aspects that could be
   significant for long-term relationship prospects. For instance, we ask
   "How important is your future partner's religion?" and "Do you want
   children? “

   Protecting your personal information is of our utmost priority. We
   utilise Manual Profile Verification, SSL Encryption and a Fraud
   Detection System to make sure members feel safe online. All sensitive
   data is encrypted and will not be revealed to any third party or other
   members.

   EliteSingles is also available in Ireland, Australia, New
   Zealand, Canada, South Africa, and the United States.

New EliteSingles iOS App

   Like all the best dating apps, ours is designed for busy singles who
   prefer to manage their lives while on the go. Our iOS app is therefore
   designed and optimised for those wanting to set up dates while out and
   about. You can complete the personality test, easily upload photos and
   fill out your profile details, all on the go!

Use EliteSingles on your smartphone or tablet with our iPhone and Android Apps

   Mobile devices
   Download on the App Store
   Get it on Google Play

     I saw Elite Singles on the telly and didn't really take it seriously
     at first. But when a friend recommended it, I guess I thought "Why
     not?" So I signed up, took the personality test, and I'm happy I
     did! I've deleted the other dating apps off my phone - I just don't
     need them anymore! Alex - London

     I got to the point where I was sick of my time being wasted, and
     EliteSingles has shown me that not all dating sites are the same. I
     take dating seriously, because I want to find the one! And I'm
     impressed with my matches so far - I'm finally feeling very
     optimistic dating online! Emily - Bristol
