   In accordance with the airworthiness authority that provided the flight
   clearance, the VSR700 was tethered with 30-metre cables to fully secure
   the flight test zone. The subsequent phases of the flight test
   programme will now evolve towards free flight, and then progressively
   open the flight envelope.

   As a canoe slalom enthusiast, Lorenz first became interested in
   composite materials working on the boats. Majoring in Composites,
   Lorenz spent most of his practical semesters at Airbus in Bremen, he
   also gained valuable experience abroad during a two months internship
   in Getafe. Now he works for Premium AEROTEC, a supplier for large
   structural components, owned by Airbus. With composites being a rather
   new material, there is always a new topic for Lorenz to explore.

   Vassilis Agouridas on the future of urban mobility solutions

   Urban air mobility is on the brink of taking to the skies above cities
   to offer a sustainable complement to ground transportation. But are
   cities and city inhabitants ready to welcome such a dramatic shift in
   their mobility mix? According to Vassilis Agouridas, Senior Manager
   Strategic Innovation at Airbus, the successful integration of urban air
   mobility hinges on co-creation among industry, regulators, cities,
   citizens and other stakeholders to find mobility solutions that deliver
   on the full spectrum of sustainability—environmental, economic and
   social.

   "Although aviation is rather a male-dominated world, it has been my
   passion since I was a child. As a flight instructor for helicopters,
   fixed wings and gliders, I love to fly all of them, but I especially
   love to fly helicopters. When I joined the company, I started my Airbus
   career as marketing manager for the training centre newly established

   “Working is more about being useful rather than being important,” says
   Jorge who has been with the company for the 13 years. He entered as a
   financial controller, and later decided to change his topic. “I enjoy
   working in HR. It is all about connecting people: making a new good
   network with people and trying to join forces for better working
   together.“ During his normal workday, Jorge is frequently switching
   between Spanish, English, German and French. Although the language
   competence has been a great help, he admits that this is not enough to
   succeed in HR. “If you are not humble, if you are not emphatic, if you
   are not flexible, then all these languages skills are not useful for
   anything.“
