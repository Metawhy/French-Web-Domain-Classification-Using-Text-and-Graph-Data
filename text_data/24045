   Posted on July 23, 2019July 23, 2019 by Paul Mayne

   It was 1888 when French inventor Louis Le Prince created Roundhay
   Garden Scene, the first motion picture ever created. To say that motion
   pictures have completely changed the world is an understatement.

   Now days, video is everywhere on every screen size. We watch them on
   giant screens in theaters, small screens on our wrists, and every

Five Tips for Keeping a Gratitude Journal

   I used to think keeping a gratitude journal was easy.

The Keystone Habit of Journaling

Day One Journaling Series:

   Article 1 • Article 2 • Article 3 • Article 4
     __________________________________________________________________

   Once you have a solid reason to journaling and quality content to write
   on it about, the only thing you need is to actually start journaling.
   However, as I illustrated in part two of this series, starting a
   journal might not actually be as easy as it seems. It is hard to go
   from writing absolutely nothing per day, to recording mutiple things on
   the next. For this reason, the biggest road block people face when they
   begin to journal is developing a habit—it is very common too see people
   journal for about two weeks then stop.

   Why exactly does that happen?

   To better understand why so many people gave up on journaling during
   the first days I decided to study a bit about how habits work. I faced
   that struggle as well when I began, so I was curious to understand why
   it happened—what I found out was impressive.

   How Habits Work

   I went to my university’s library in search of a good book about habits
   and eventually came across Charles Duhigg’s The Power of Habit book.
   The book was so engaging that I was able to finish it in about two
   days. I won’t bother you with the book details, but what I learned
   about habits from that book helped me solve the journaling puzzle.

   According to Duhigg, the development of a habit is comprised of three
   parts:

     First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into
     automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the routine,
     which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a
     reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is
     worth remembering for the future:

   Image5

   But that doesn’t explain why people stop journaling after a week or
   two; there is more to it. Duhigg later discovered that there is a
   missing element in his first habit-formation theory. By observing
   studying he found out that the missing component was the craving part.
   The habit only becomes automatic, and powerful, once the cue triggers a
   craving. Something along the lines of:

   A habit loop would then form: upon coming into contact with a cue, the
   person would automatically crave the reward.

   Image6

   The Journaling Habit

   Ok, that is very interesting. But how this it apply to journaling?
   Simple. If instead of just resolving one bright summer day that you
   will begin to journal, you setup cues for doing such, your chances of
   success are a lot bigger. A good example of this would be to journal
   right after you shower in the morning, or right before you go to bed at
   night. The cue would be to, as soon as you have put on some clothes
   after you morning shower, you pick up Day One to journal. Your reward
   could be a breakfast, or just a calmer state of mind to begin the day.

   That isn’t to say that you should only journal at that specific times
   and days. In my case for instance, I would sometimes go five, or even
   ten days without journaling. But once I did open Day One, it was
   indredibly easy for me to spill out 2,000 words. It depends on how you
   want things to work. Nonetheless, find your cue and establish the
   routine and reward—it really doesn’t matter if you journal 365, or 20
   days a year—so that a habit can be formed.

   One note, Duhigg’s final realization also helps you to understand if
   journaling has yet become a personal habit. If when you see that
   gorgeous Day One app, you immediately crave the feeling of satisfaction
   you feel upon offloading your thoughts, you are good to go. And I can
   assure you, from then on it just gets better and better.

   A Keystone Habit

   Journaling is not a commonplace habit, it is a keystone habit. Keystone
   habits affect how you work, eat, play, live, spend, and communicate. As
   Duhigg says, “they encourage change by creating structures that help
   other habits to flourish.” A very well-known example of a keystone
   habit is working out. The amount of areas of your life that are
   impacted after implementing a work out routine—eating, sleep quality,
   mood, physical health—is a proof that a minor change in one aspect of
   your life can trigger so many other positive changes.

   The same applies for journaling. Once you are locked in the journaling
   habit, you will automatically see an increase in other positive life
   habits. Personally, I started to feel less worried about things. Before
   I journaled, I sometimes felt a big confusion in my head; now, all that
   confusion is resting on Day One, ready for me to analyze it when I’m in
   a calmer state of mind.

   The habit of journaling allowed me to become more sensitive to small
   things around me, to appreciate some moments better, to write more, to
   communicate better, to be more comprehensive, and ultimately: to live a
   happier life.
