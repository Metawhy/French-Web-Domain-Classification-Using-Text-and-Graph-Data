iPhone XS Max teardown reveals new sensor with more focus pixels

   Published Sep 27, 2018 | Lars Rehm

   [Apple-iPhone-Xs-back-camera-09122018.jpeg]

   When Apple announced the new iPhone models XS and XS Max the company
   told us that the camera's wide-angle module featured a larger sensor
   with 1.4 µm pixels compared to 1.22 µm on last year's iPhone X.

   Now a teardown performed by TechInsights has confirmed the new sensor,
   but has also revealed some additional detail about the wide-angle
   camera. The sensor is a stacked model provided by Sony on a 7.01 mm x
   5.79 mm (40.6 mm^2) sized die. This is 7.8 mm^2 more than the
   wide-angle camera sensor on the iPhones X and 8 Plus. The actual active
   area of the sensor is around 5.6 x 4.2 mm, which is likely to see it
   classed as a 1/2.5"-type chip.

     TechInsights engineers noticed an increased density of Focus Pixels

   In addition, the TechInsights engineers noticed an increased density of
   Focus Pixels. This means more regions of the sensor are available as
   autofocus points and should, at least in theory, improve autofocus
   performance in most light conditions and shooting situations. Focus
   Pixels is an Apple term for masked PDAF pixels which were first
   introduced in 2014 with the iPhone 6.

   TechInsight's teardown is still in progress, so we hope the team can
   provide some more information and also have a closer look at the
   camera's 2x tele-module, which on paper looks unchanged from last year,
   over the coming days.

   I have tested the XS intensively against the old iPhone X.
   I have come to the conclusion that the new camera delivers better image
   quality in almost any shooting conditions indeed: Better lowlight,
   better dynamic range, better AF, better video, better image stabilizer,
   better color rendition. The new wideangle lens helps for landscapes,
   indoor and street photography.

   Pretty impressed with the XS camera (I have the Max).
   Previously I had the X and that camera was good, but smart HDR and the
   newer sensor are a good improvement - more even tones, retaining
   highlights... Low light shots look excellent. Sadly Apple's aggressive
   noise reduction is still present but you have the option to shoot RAW
   with a third party app if need be.

   Yes if one compares the RAW output with jpeg then one wonders what
   Apple is smoking, why can't they dial back the over-processed approach
   like Pixel, Samsung (and Huawei are doing now) have done over the last
   2 years, which leads to more natural looking jpegs... come one Apple!

   I have the 512 Max in the gold color, and it is an improvement over my
   7+ that it replaced. I had the X for about a week, but I sent it back
   because I could not get used to the smaller screen. I no longer get all
   excited over the 'newest' version because I don't leverage the iPhone
   in the same way that I used to. Even so, I have always purchased the
   iPhones in their fully maxed-out version. The price is high and seems
   like Apple is setting the bar of profit to a level that may eventually
   diminish sales. As for the camera(s); they're okay for a phone based
   system, but nothing to get excited about.

   I still can't over excited about the picture taking capabilities of a
   phone. I use myiPhone to take pictures but it's never the quality thats
   lacking. It's the fact sometimes ittakes a picture when I want other
   times intakes them when it wants to.
   Sometimes when it comes out of my pocket its selected slow mo or square
   or something. What I can't get out of a phone is the ability to be
   ready when I need it, not the ability to create sudo portraits.

   There are always cons to the pros. More masked pixels also means less
   light captured. If every pixel was masked, the phone would capture half
   as much light.

   Sounds like they've also increased sensor size, and use a larger
   aperture. So this should net positive.

   Sure, increase the number of masked pixels from 1% to 2% and you
   capture about 1.01% less light, a completely undetectable difference.

   It's not undetectable. Banding has already been observed in the raw
   files, because the masking is not evenly distributed: certain pixels
   are literally half masked.

   Yeah, but these problems are not due to the sensor receiving less total
   light but either due to some small variation at the hardware level (for
   those rows having 'focus pixels') or the interpolation needed to ensure
   that the 'focus pixels' don't show up as spots in the image.

   Yes, if you want to convey the sense of tallness you should shoot
   vertically. Trouble is, most smartphone users haven't got enough
   discernment to know when to use their device horizontally or
   vertically. They shoot both pictures and video vertically because
   that's the way you hold the phone and visualize photos and videos.
   Dumb, I know, but true.

The iPhone 11 Pro Max gets the teardown treatment from iFixit

   As it does with nearly every Apple smartphone, tablet and computer that
   hits shelves, iFixit has torn down an iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro Max
   to reveal what technological goodies are hidden within. The teardown
   didn’t reveal too many surprises, overall, but a few interesting things
   did pop up.
   [iFixit_iPhone_11_Pro_Max_teardown_5.jpeg]
   From left to right: the iPhones XR, XS Max and 11 Pro Max.

   Before cracking into any of the devices, iFixit teamed up with Creative
   Electron to X-ray the phones before they were opened up. As seen above,
   there’s not a millimeter of free space within the frames and although
   the same general layout was used, there are a few noticeable
   differences between the iPhone 11 models and the iPhone XS models.
   Considering the iPhone 11 Pro Max is the most interesting of the
   devices from a photography standpoint, that’s the teardown we’ll be
   focusing on here, although the full teardown of the iPhone 11 is
   available on iFixit.

   Most notably, the iPhone 11 Pro Max uses a single-cell L-shaped
   battery, instead of two separate batteries found inside previous
   Plus/Max models. Apple also dropped down the logic board, presumably to
   make room for the much larger three-camera array.
   [iFixit_iPhone_11_Pro_Max_teardown_4.jpeg]

   In ‘Step 6,’ iFixit gets to the camera modules. The team at iFixit also
   had X-rays performed on the camera modules, which revealed the optical
   image stabilization on the wide and telephoto camera modules. According
   to the teardown, iFixit plans on doing a more detailed analysis of the
   camera unit, so when that goes live we’ll be sure to cover accordingly.
   [iFixit_iPhone_11_Pro_Max_teardown_3.jpeg]
   The black bars in the two larger camera modules are the OIS units.

   Moving on, the iFixit team digs into the nitty-gritty details of the
   logic board and all of the individual chips, memory units and sensors
   within.

   At ‘Step 13’ the battery gets some attention and iFixit reveals it was
   ‘pleasantly surprised to find some relatively repair-friendly
   features.’ The battery analysis also reveals the battery inside the
   iPhone 11 Pro Max ‘pumps out 3969 mAh at 3.79 V, for a total of 15.04
   Wh [...] a whopping 2.96 Wh more than the XS Max battery, and 1.52 Wh
   less than the Galaxy Note 10+ 5G battery.’ Of course, this increased
   capacity comes with a slight size increase. The battery inside the
   iPhone 11 Pro Max is 4.6mm thick and weighs 59.6g, which is 0.7mm
   thicker and 13g heavier than the dual-cell battery arrangement inside
   the iPhone XS Max.
   [iFixit_iPhone_11_Pro_Max_teardown_2.jpeg]

   The remainder of the teardown covers the bottom section of the devices,
   which includes speakers, microphones, charging ports, additional cables
   and more. iFixit gives the iPhone 11 Pro Max a repairability score of
   six out of ten, mostly due to the fact that if the back glass cracks
   the entire device essentially needs to be stripped away to repair it.

   360 photos and video can be very useful for certain applications (as
   well as having fun). The Vuze+ is an affordable 360 camera that
   supports both 2D and 3D (stereo vision) capture, and might be the best
   option for someone wanting to experiment with the 360 format.

   The EOS M6 Mark II renews Canon's commitment to making small,
   enthusiast-friendly APS-C mirrorless cameras. With 4K video, 30 fps Raw
   bursts and additional controls, it's a big step forward from its
   predecessor. And perhaps more interesting than the EOS 90D.

Kenko's new flash automatically moves its own head for optional bounce
lighting

   arent&enablejsapi=1

   Accessories manufacturer Kenko has introduced a flash unit that
   automatically rotates and tilts its own head to bounce its output from
   ceilings and walls to provide the ideal soft lighting. The Kenko
   AB600-R follows the lead of Canon’s Speedlite 470EX-AI by using motors
   to move its own head into the ideal position to suit the room and the
   subject, as well as the orientation of the camera.
   [5cf7967eafd1f.jpeg]

   The new flash unit measures the distance between itself and the
   subject, as well as between itself and the bounce surface, and
   automatically calculates the best angle from which to direct its light.
   The user can also position the head manually and have the flash unit
   rotate itself when the camera is turned to be used in a different
   orientation or at an angle.
   [5cf797aec968e.jpeg]

   Where the Kenko flash differs from the Canon model is that it has a
   guide number of 60m/197ft at ISO 100 (using the 200mm setting) and it
   offers radio control for wireless operation as well as optical. In
   wireless mode the unit can act as a master or slave, and can be
   controlled additionally via the WTR-1 wireless transceiver.
   [5cf797a736ddf.jpeg]

   The zoom head can track focal lengths of between 24mm and 200mm, and
   with the built-in diffuser lowered it will cover the angle of view of
   an 18mm lens. First and second curtain triggering options can be set,
   and strobe and high speed sync modes are also available.

   The head is powered by 4 AA batteries, but can also be powered by the
   BP-1 external battery pack and comes with a two-year guarantee. At the
   moment it comes with i-TTL compatibility for Nikon users (though B&H is
   advertising a Canon version – but showing the Nikon one), and costs
   $400 / £400. It is expected in stores in November. For more information
   see the Kenko website.

   Manufacturer information

New: AI Flash AB600-R

   An electronic flash with Auto Bounce and Angle Lock functions.

   The Kenko AB600-R is a high-power, 'Advanced Intelligence' flashgun
   which enables photographers to raise their game to another level,
   helping them automate the lighting process and get the best results
   every time.

   Amongst its many features, the Kenko AI flash AB600-R incorporates an
   'AI' Auto-Bounce function that takes care of the most difficult part in
   the shooting process: Bounce flash. By automatically calculating and
   moving to the optimum bounce angle, it enables the photographer to
   concentrate on the artistic part of the process, achieving better
   results in a more efficient way.

   3D Auto Bounce function - The auto-bounce function of the Kenko AI
   flash AB600-R automatically calculates the most appropriate angle of
   light-bounce from the wall (left or right side) or from the ceiling.
   With the help of the auto bounce function, the photographer can
   accomplish a perfect shot with just a single shutter release; no more
   wasting time thinking and testing the optimal light path during the
   photo session. This function is invaluable for wedding photographers or
   anyone shooting portraits to a tight schedule, when the photographer
   has no time for failure. Auto Lock function - Allows the photographer
   to adjust the desired bounce angle, based on the automatically
   calculated one, in manual mode and lets the system remember this angle
   when the camera is turned from horizontal to vertical format. This
   allows the photographer to really focus on the artistic part of the
   shooting process, like composition and interaction with the model,
   making the process of getting the ideal shot so much quicker and
   easier.

   Guide number: 60 - With a maximum guide number 60 (ISO 100 at 200mm),
   the Kenko AI flash AB600-R has all the power it needs to deal with wide
   range of scenes and situations.

   Master to slave flash angle remote control - The built-in radio
   transmitting and receiving unit allows a master flash to control the
   bounce angle of the slave flash remotely.

   Optical and radio (2.4GHz) wireless control - For off-camera and
   multiple flash shooting. Sync terminal is also supported.

   Auto and manual zoom adjustment - Light coverage angle equal to the
   18-200mm range (18mm achieved when used with the wide diffuser panel).
   External power supply - The optional BP-1 battery pack supports longer
   shooting sessions and delivers faster recycling times. Firmware updates
   - The Kenko AI Flash AB600-R firmware can be updated via micro USB
   port.
     * Zoom Range: 20-200mm (18mm using wide diffuser panel)
     * Flash Modes: i-TTL-BL / i-TTL / Manual / Strobe (1-200Hz), 1st/2nd
       curtain sync, high-speed sync
     * Power: 4x AA type batteries (alkaline / Nickel Metal Hydride), or
       external BP-1 battery pack
     * Recycling Time: Approx. 0.1-3.5 sec (using NiMH batteries)
     * AF beam assist: 29 point AF
     * Exposure adjustment: -3.0 to +3.0 stops (TTL mode), Full power to
       1/128 power (Manual mode)
     * Wireless Communication Systems: Optical and Radio (2.4GHz)
     * Bounce Mode: AI Auto bounce / Manual bounce (both with angle lock
       function)
     * External Connections: Micro USB (for firmware updates) / Sync
       terminal / External power supply
     * Dimensions (HxWxD): 196 x 80 x 62mm

   On the rare occasion that I use a flash I usually stick a large
   polystyrene coffee mug over the end of it. It works like the world's
   largest Omnibounce, only better, as there is more surface area.

   I have no idea who will buy this. As a full time corp event
   photographer, I find these types of flashes totally useless. And I
   doubt many amateurs have an interest. From the numbers of Canon's
   version, I think we can safely say this is dead in the water. Godox is
   killing it with USEFUL flashes. Long life battery. Magnetic attachments
   on the new and AFFORDABLE as well as powerful V1. Good luck competing
   with Godox.

   A counterfeit product is by definition branded as the original it is
   trying to counterfeit. Since this is Kenko, it is not a counterfeit. It
   is a third-party device- a very different thing.

   Guess I will need to buy six sets of batteries for each shoot to allow
   for the electronic drain moving the head. Or do I stick to three sets
   and aim it by hand just where I want it ?

   When a flash's power is really and actually specified with the guide
   number for its 200mm reflector setting, guide numbers have become
   completely meaningless.

   Liked. Would be too nice if GNs were always given for ISO 100, 50 mms
   FF equivalent.

   But then, if you're a flash manufacturer's shareholder, you will insist
   on GNs based on ISO 1000, 50 mms smartphone equivalent.

   They call it GN laundering.

   $400 is acceptable for a flash that automates this task.

   The big question is how well it does this job.

   I'm guessing the furthest surface it can find that's still within the
   power capability of the flash's output (furthest surface = softer
   light, but due to inverse square will reduce light intensity on
   subject, thus balance between softness and power).

   Barlowephoto - True, but I think this is intended for journalistic
   photographers and events photographers, who are more concerned with
   getting a publishable image than in getting one with great aesthetic
   value. These people need often to work very quickly, and this would
   save them time when rapidly alternating between portrait and landscape
   formats.

   For them, it might be useful, although I suspect most would choose the
   original Canon version for guaranteed compatibilty and (probably)
   greater reliability.

   Those of us concerned with aesthetics will use more sophisticated forms
   of artificial lighting, or (in my case) shoot only by ambient lighting.

   Entoman, in my opinion this is aimed just at beginners. Event
   Photographers need something fast to change directions and not to wait
   until this flash decides where to turn. Journalistic Photographers have
   the same needs, a quick change of the direction of the flash head.
   The Canon and i expect this one also are much to slow in operating. The
   video shown is in bright light with not too much flashlight needed.

iPhone XS Max teardown reveals new sensor with more focus pixels

   Published Sep 27, 2018 | Lars Rehm

   [Apple-iPhone-Xs-back-camera-09122018.jpeg]

   When Apple announced the new iPhone models XS and XS Max the company
   told us that the camera's wide-angle module featured a larger sensor
   with 1.4 µm pixels compared to 1.22 µm on last year's iPhone X.

   Now a teardown performed by TechInsights has confirmed the new sensor,
   but has also revealed some additional detail about the wide-angle
   camera. The sensor is a stacked model provided by Sony on a 7.01 mm x
   5.79 mm (40.6 mm^2) sized die. This is 7.8 mm^2 more than the
   wide-angle camera sensor on the iPhones X and 8 Plus. The actual active
   area of the sensor is around 5.6 x 4.2 mm, which is likely to see it
   classed as a 1/2.5"-type chip.

     TechInsights engineers noticed an increased density of Focus Pixels

   In addition, the TechInsights engineers noticed an increased density of
   Focus Pixels. This means more regions of the sensor are available as
   autofocus points and should, at least in theory, improve autofocus
   performance in most light conditions and shooting situations. Focus
   Pixels is an Apple term for masked PDAF pixels which were first
   introduced in 2014 with the iPhone 6.

   TechInsight's teardown is still in progress, so we hope the team can
   provide some more information and also have a closer look at the
   camera's 2x tele-module, which on paper looks unchanged from last year,
   over the coming days.

   I have tested the XS intensively against the old iPhone X.
   I have come to the conclusion that the new camera delivers better image
   quality in almost any shooting conditions indeed: Better lowlight,
   better dynamic range, better AF, better video, better image stabilizer,
   better color rendition. The new wideangle lens helps for landscapes,
   indoor and street photography.

   Pretty impressed with the XS camera (I have the Max).
   Previously I had the X and that camera was good, but smart HDR and the
   newer sensor are a good improvement - more even tones, retaining
   highlights... Low light shots look excellent. Sadly Apple's aggressive
   noise reduction is still present but you have the option to shoot RAW
   with a third party app if need be.

   Yes if one compares the RAW output with jpeg then one wonders what
   Apple is smoking, why can't they dial back the over-processed approach
   like Pixel, Samsung (and Huawei are doing now) have done over the last
   2 years, which leads to more natural looking jpegs... come one Apple!

   I have the 512 Max in the gold color, and it is an improvement over my
   7+ that it replaced. I had the X for about a week, but I sent it back
   because I could not get used to the smaller screen. I no longer get all
   excited over the 'newest' version because I don't leverage the iPhone
   in the same way that I used to. Even so, I have always purchased the
   iPhones in their fully maxed-out version. The price is high and seems
   like Apple is setting the bar of profit to a level that may eventually
   diminish sales. As for the camera(s); they're okay for a phone based
   system, but nothing to get excited about.

   I still can't over excited about the picture taking capabilities of a
   phone. I use myiPhone to take pictures but it's never the quality thats
   lacking. It's the fact sometimes ittakes a picture when I want other
   times intakes them when it wants to.
   Sometimes when it comes out of my pocket its selected slow mo or square
   or something. What I can't get out of a phone is the ability to be
   ready when I need it, not the ability to create sudo portraits.

   There are always cons to the pros. More masked pixels also means less
   light captured. If every pixel was masked, the phone would capture half
   as much light.

   Sounds like they've also increased sensor size, and use a larger
   aperture. So this should net positive.

   Sure, increase the number of masked pixels from 1% to 2% and you
   capture about 1.01% less light, a completely undetectable difference.

   It's not undetectable. Banding has already been observed in the raw
   files, because the masking is not evenly distributed: certain pixels
   are literally half masked.

   Yeah, but these problems are not due to the sensor receiving less total
   light but either due to some small variation at the hardware level (for
   those rows having 'focus pixels') or the interpolation needed to ensure
   that the 'focus pixels' don't show up as spots in the image.

   Yes, if you want to convey the sense of tallness you should shoot
   vertically. Trouble is, most smartphone users haven't got enough
   discernment to know when to use their device horizontally or
   vertically. They shoot both pictures and video vertically because
   that's the way you hold the phone and visualize photos and videos.

   360 photos and video can be very useful for certain applications (as
   well as having fun). The Vuze+ is an affordable 360 camera that
   supports both 2D and 3D (stereo vision) capture, and might be the best
   option for someone wanting to experiment with the 360 format.

The iPhone 11 Pro Max gets the teardown treatment from iFixit

   As it does with nearly every Apple smartphone, tablet and computer that
   hits shelves, iFixit has torn down an iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro Max
   to reveal what technological goodies are hidden within. The teardown
   didn’t reveal too many surprises, overall, but a few interesting things
   did pop up.
   [iFixit_iPhone_11_Pro_Max_teardown_5.jpeg]
   From left to right: the iPhones XR, XS Max and 11 Pro Max.

   Before cracking into any of the devices, iFixit teamed up with Creative
   Electron to X-ray the phones before they were opened up. As seen above,
   there’s not a millimeter of free space within the frames and although
   the same general layout was used, there are a few noticeable
   differences between the iPhone 11 models and the iPhone XS models.
   Considering the iPhone 11 Pro Max is the most interesting of the
   devices from a photography standpoint, that’s the teardown we’ll be
   focusing on here, although the full teardown of the iPhone 11 is
   available on iFixit.

   Most notably, the iPhone 11 Pro Max uses a single-cell L-shaped
   battery, instead of two separate batteries found inside previous
   Plus/Max models. Apple also dropped down the logic board, presumably to
   make room for the much larger three-camera array.
   [iFixit_iPhone_11_Pro_Max_teardown_4.jpeg]

   In ‘Step 6,’ iFixit gets to the camera modules. The team at iFixit also
   had X-rays performed on the camera modules, which revealed the optical
   image stabilization on the wide and telephoto camera modules. According
   to the teardown, iFixit plans on doing a more detailed analysis of the
   camera unit, so when that goes live we’ll be sure to cover accordingly.
   [iFixit_iPhone_11_Pro_Max_teardown_3.jpeg]
   The black bars in the two larger camera modules are the OIS units.

   Moving on, the iFixit team digs into the nitty-gritty details of the
   logic board and all of the individual chips, memory units and sensors
   within.

   At ‘Step 13’ the battery gets some attention and iFixit reveals it was
   ‘pleasantly surprised to find some relatively repair-friendly
   features.’ The battery analysis also reveals the battery inside the
   iPhone 11 Pro Max ‘pumps out 3969 mAh at 3.79 V, for a total of 15.04
   Wh [...] a whopping 2.96 Wh more than the XS Max battery, and 1.52 Wh
   less than the Galaxy Note 10+ 5G battery.’ Of course, this increased
   capacity comes with a slight size increase. The battery inside the
   iPhone 11 Pro Max is 4.6mm thick and weighs 59.6g, which is 0.7mm
   thicker and 13g heavier than the dual-cell battery arrangement inside
   the iPhone XS Max.
   [iFixit_iPhone_11_Pro_Max_teardown_2.jpeg]

   The remainder of the teardown covers the bottom section of the devices,
   which includes speakers, microphones, charging ports, additional cables
   and more. iFixit gives the iPhone 11 Pro Max a repairability score of
   six out of ten, mostly due to the fact that if the back glass cracks
   the entire device essentially needs to be stripped away to repair it.

   reviewSep 9, 2019 at 13:00

   360 photos and video can be very useful for certain applications (as
   well as having fun). The Vuze+ is an affordable 360 camera that
   supports both 2D and 3D (stereo vision) capture, and might be the best
   option for someone wanting to experiment with the 360 format.

   Canon EOS M6 II initial review: What's new and how it compares
   first impressionsAug 28, 2019 at 04:00

   The EOS M6 Mark II renews Canon's commitment to making small,
   enthusiast-friendly APS-C mirrorless cameras. With 4K video, 30 fps Raw
   bursts and additional controls, it's a big step forward from its
   predecessor. And perhaps more interesting than the EOS 90D.

Kenko's new flash automatically moves its own head for optional bounce
lighting

   arent&enablejsapi=1

   Accessories manufacturer Kenko has introduced a flash unit that
   automatically rotates and tilts its own head to bounce its output from
   ceilings and walls to provide the ideal soft lighting. The Kenko
   AB600-R follows the lead of Canon’s Speedlite 470EX-AI by using motors
   to move its own head into the ideal position to suit the room and the
   subject, as well as the orientation of the camera.
   [5cf7967eafd1f.jpeg]

   The new flash unit measures the distance between itself and the
   subject, as well as between itself and the bounce surface, and
   automatically calculates the best angle from which to direct its light.
   The user can also position the head manually and have the flash unit
   rotate itself when the camera is turned to be used in a different
   orientation or at an angle.
   [5cf797aec968e.jpeg]

   Where the Kenko flash differs from the Canon model is that it has a
   guide number of 60m/197ft at ISO 100 (using the 200mm setting) and it
   offers radio control for wireless operation as well as optical. In
   wireless mode the unit can act as a master or slave, and can be
   controlled additionally via the WTR-1 wireless transceiver.
   [5cf797a736ddf.jpeg]

   The zoom head can track focal lengths of between 24mm and 200mm, and
   with the built-in diffuser lowered it will cover the angle of view of
   an 18mm lens. First and second curtain triggering options can be set,
   and strobe and high speed sync modes are also available.

   The head is powered by 4 AA batteries, but can also be powered by the
   BP-1 external battery pack and comes with a two-year guarantee. At the
   moment it comes with i-TTL compatibility for Nikon users (though B&H is
   advertising a Canon version – but showing the Nikon one), and costs
   $400 / £400. It is expected in stores in November. For more information
   see the Kenko website.

   Manufacturer information

New: AI Flash AB600-R

   An electronic flash with Auto Bounce and Angle Lock functions.

   The Kenko AB600-R is a high-power, 'Advanced Intelligence' flashgun
   which enables photographers to raise their game to another level,
   helping them automate the lighting process and get the best results
   every time.

   Amongst its many features, the Kenko AI flash AB600-R incorporates an
   'AI' Auto-Bounce function that takes care of the most difficult part in
   the shooting process: Bounce flash. By automatically calculating and
   moving to the optimum bounce angle, it enables the photographer to
   concentrate on the artistic part of the process, achieving better
   results in a more efficient way.

   3D Auto Bounce function - The auto-bounce function of the Kenko AI
   flash AB600-R automatically calculates the most appropriate angle of
   light-bounce from the wall (left or right side) or from the ceiling.
   With the help of the auto bounce function, the photographer can
   accomplish a perfect shot with just a single shutter release; no more
   wasting time thinking and testing the optimal light path during the
   photo session. This function is invaluable for wedding photographers or
   anyone shooting portraits to a tight schedule, when the photographer
   has no time for failure. Auto Lock function - Allows the photographer
   to adjust the desired bounce angle, based on the automatically
   calculated one, in manual mode and lets the system remember this angle
   when the camera is turned from horizontal to vertical format. This
   allows the photographer to really focus on the artistic part of the
   shooting process, like composition and interaction with the model,
   making the process of getting the ideal shot so much quicker and
   easier.

   Guide number: 60 - With a maximum guide number 60 (ISO 100 at 200mm),
   the Kenko AI flash AB600-R has all the power it needs to deal with wide
   range of scenes and situations.

   Master to slave flash angle remote control - The built-in radio
   transmitting and receiving unit allows a master flash to control the
   bounce angle of the slave flash remotely.

   Optical and radio (2.4GHz) wireless control - For off-camera and
   multiple flash shooting. Sync terminal is also supported.

   Auto and manual zoom adjustment - Light coverage angle equal to the
   18-200mm range (18mm achieved when used with the wide diffuser panel).
   External power supply - The optional BP-1 battery pack supports longer
   shooting sessions and delivers faster recycling times. Firmware updates
   - The Kenko AI Flash AB600-R firmware can be updated via micro USB
   port.
     * Zoom Range: 20-200mm (18mm using wide diffuser panel)
     * Flash Modes: i-TTL-BL / i-TTL / Manual / Strobe (1-200Hz), 1st/2nd
       curtain sync, high-speed sync
     * Power: 4x AA type batteries (alkaline / Nickel Metal Hydride), or
       external BP-1 battery pack
     * Recycling Time: Approx. 0.1-3.5 sec (using NiMH batteries)
     * AF beam assist: 29 point AF
     * Exposure adjustment: -3.0 to +3.0 stops (TTL mode), Full power to
       1/128 power (Manual mode)
     * Wireless Communication Systems: Optical and Radio (2.4GHz)
     * Bounce Mode: AI Auto bounce / Manual bounce (both with angle lock
       function)
     * External Connections: Micro USB (for firmware updates) / Sync
       terminal / External power supply
     * Dimensions (HxWxD): 196 x 80 x 62mm

   On the rare occasion that I use a flash I usually stick a large
   polystyrene coffee mug over the end of it. It works like the world's
   largest Omnibounce, only better, as there is more surface area.

   I have no idea who will buy this. As a full time corp event
   photographer, I find these types of flashes totally useless. And I
   doubt many amateurs have an interest. From the numbers of Canon's
   version, I think we can safely say this is dead in the water. Godox is
   killing it with USEFUL flashes. Long life battery. Magnetic attachments
   on the new and AFFORDABLE as well as powerful V1. Good luck competing
   with Godox.

   A counterfeit product is by definition branded as the original it is
   trying to counterfeit. Since this is Kenko, it is not a counterfeit. It
   is a third-party device- a very different thing.

   "When a flash's power is really and actually specified with the guide
   number for its 200mm reflector setting, guide numbers have become
   completely meaningless."
   --
   Liked. Would be too nice if GNs were always given for ISO 100, 50 mms
   FF equivalent.

   But then, if you're a flash manufacturer's shareholder, you will insist
   on GNs based on ISO 1000, 50 mms smartphone equivalent.

   They call it GN laundering.

   I can't wait to see a review on this by DPR.

   $400 is acceptable for a flash that automates this task.

   The big question is how well it does this job.

   I'm guessing the furthest surface it can find that's still within the
   power capability of the flash's output (furthest surface = softer
   light, but due to inverse square will reduce light intensity on
   subject, thus balance between softness and power).

   Barlowephoto - True, but I think this is intended for journalistic
   photographers and events photographers, who are more concerned with
   getting a publishable image than in getting one with great aesthetic
   value. These people need often to work very quickly, and this would
   save them time when rapidly alternating between portrait and landscape
   formats.

   For them, it might be useful, although I suspect most would choose the
   original Canon version for guaranteed compatibilty and (probably)
   greater reliability.

   Those of us concerned with aesthetics will use more sophisticated forms
   of artificial lighting, or (in my case) shoot only by ambient lighting.

   Entoman, in my opinion this is aimed just at beginners. Event
   Photographers need something fast to change directions and not to wait
   until this flash decides where to turn. Journalistic Photographers have
   the same needs, a quick change of the direction of the flash head.
   The Canon and i expect this one also are much to slow in operating. The
   video shown is in bright light with not too much flashlight needed.

Nikon Z 85mm F1.8 S sample gallery

   Buy on Amazon.fr From EUR 549,00

   Nikon's latest Z-series prime is one of its most impressive, offering
   very similar optical characteristics to the Z 50mm F1.8 S which we
   liked so much when we tested it back in January. Providing a
   traditional portrait focal length and moderately fast aperture, the Z
   85mm is fairly pricey by the standards of an F1.8 prime, but it's hard
   to argue with the image quality, at any price.

   We've been shooting with the Z 85mm F1.8 S for a few days, to see what
   it can do. Take a look through our full gallery of sample images.
   Is this our most dog-heavy sample gallery yet? it might just be.

   Kudos for the excellent sample images!
   Good photos in their own right, and showcasing the lens in a wide array
   of shooting scenarios.

   Far too often I feel like official sample images don't do justice to

   Beautiful results of a well made lens. Not sure about the price though.
   I mean, Nikon definitely wins in this category, again, but it is still
   only an F1.8 lens. However, it's a much much nicer option than
   something like a $1000 56F1.2 crop. Which proves the point that crops
   are ridiculously overpriced and overrated.

   I am extremely happy with my Z6 and the lenses 24-70 f/4, 50 f/1.8 and
   35 f/1.8. Happy shooting for two months already. Never seen or tried
   anything like this before (had Nikon DX and FX and also tried some
   Canons and Sonies). Tried 85 f/1.8 in the shop a few days ago and it is
   stellar, can't believe it. I own the F-mount 85 f/1.8 and compared it
   with this new S lens. I was happy to have my F-mount lens + FTZ and
   believed it was just fine for my needs but this new lens is something
   special. Extremely sharp at any f, great bokeh, fairly compact. A bit
   pricey, but Christmas is coming - can't wait for a few more months.

   This is exactly why I switched to the Nikon mirrorless from Canon. The

   Obviously there are enough people who either need (or have been hyped
   intp believing that they need) the sort of wide-aperture super-optics
   that Canon and others are releasing, but yes, F2, F2.8 or F4 lenses are
   fine for most purposes. Lighter, more compact, cheaper and usually of
   equal image quality at the apertures people most commonly use.

   The Sigma 45mm 2.8 is an example of a lens that in some situations, or
   for some people, will actually be perceived as better optically than a
   high end modern 1.2 prime. Given the resolution performance targets
   that modern lenses are expected to achieve in most lens reviews
   (otherwise they'd be trashed) very fast primes have so little on axis
   aberrations left by f2.8 that they can't use them like the Sigma does
   to enhance / modulate rear OOF transitions at smaller apertures.
   I used to think that at 85mm I'd like to have at least f2 but these
   days I'm more and more inclined to favour a f2.8 with nearly non
   existent vignetting and a design philosophy otherwise not dissimilar to
   the Sigma.

   Canon has some cool stuff for sure, but I wonder how many people will

   thing is enormous. Its pushing the envelope for even the modern gear
   people who seem to enjoy carrying around big lenses.

   I applaud Nikon for their sound strategy: why in the age of great high
   ISO and IBIS would we be hauling around big, expensive 1.4 lenses?
   These Nikons seems to be the sweet spot of everything.

   I really like this lens.

   Compared to my Nikkor 85mm f/1.4G and Nikkor 85mm f/1.8G, the Nikkor
   85mm f/1.8 S is sharper, has excellent bokeh, and has very minimal
   purple fringing even when used in harsh lighting condition.

   This lens also focuses a bit faster, more accurately and is quieter as
   well. Flare resistance is good as is color.

   Stabilization is also notably better (being a native Z-mount lens means
   IBIS is more effective than an F-mount with an FTZ).

   The times when I felt as pleased with a lens as this was when I got the
   Nikkor 200mm f/2.0, Zeiss 135mm f/2.0, Nikkor 105mm f/1.4E and the
   Nikkor 19mm f/4E PC. It's good to the point where I no longer feel the
   need to use the bigger heavier Nikkor 105mm f/1.4E on FTZ to pair with
   the Nikkor 35mm f/1.8 S on a 2nd Z6. The weight reduction is quite
   substantial.

   Given how good this lens is, I look forward to Nikon producing a Nikkor
   135mm f/1.8 S ... hopefully soon!

   I compared it to my Sigma 85/1.4 Art. At the same aperture, the Nikkor
   often shows a more nervous bokeh. What I also dislike very much: if the
   AF is off and I enlarge LV to correct it manually, there's a lag
   between turning the focusring and the stepping motor effectively waking
   up. In dark conditions the Z 7 struggles with AF. Might be better with
   the Z 6, but the struggling starts at EV values I'm still able to focus
   the Art.

   It is rather compact and rather sharp, but I'm not blown away. I was
   expecting more at this price and I also would have appreciated a lens
   display - the Z system apparently doens't measure or approximate
   distance.

   Thanks. It's more a question of putting these crops in context. Alone
   they can't be enough to form an opinion as the transition zone can vary
   a lot depending on many factors and some trade offs here and there can
   provide benefits otherwise. Perhaps I'm wrong but these are not from
   the centre of the frame, right ?

Meet the Canon EOS M200

   The Canon EOS M200 is a modest update to the M100 that was announced in
   August 2017. Most of the changes are courtesy of the new Digic 8
   processor, which allows for 4K video capture, eye detection autofocus
   and improved battery life.

   Canon didn't change the design of the camera because, frankly, this
   entry-level, selfie-friendly camera didn't need it. But more about that
   in the slides ahead.

   The M200 will be available in October in your choice of white or black
   for $549/£499/€569, which includes the EF-M 15-45mm F4.5-6.3 IS STM
   lens.

   When a camera company releases a camera without giving a prototype to
   reviewers they are saying this camera is not for you. The camera is too
   low end for camera people...our target market is for someone who has
   never used a camera before.

   The M100 has always looked like a ‘handbag’ camera; but get over the
   fact you don’t have a PSAM dial and what you do have is a cracking
   camera with great IQ, fantastic screen and a low cost, pin sharp lens
   range ... even the option to add EF-S lenses!

   In the UK you can pick up a new M100 for sub £300 ... and when you take
   a moment to investigate this camera, you realise it’s a bit of a hidden
   gem! (You can then upgrade to the M5/M6 and carry over the glass).

   This upgrade is about as inspiring as the upgrade from the 20D to the
   30D. The Fuji X-A7 makes a far better case for smartphone users wanting
   to upgrade to an entry level camera with video. The 4K video crop on
   the M200 was inevitable, given the size of the camera, and it doesn't
   bother me. However, it will make the YouTube talking heads happy -
   those egocentric folks who believe that their dull talking head content
   must be in 4K with "cinematic" 24p frame rate.

   If the X-A7 isn't affordable, and you can live without most of the new
   features it comes with, then a refurbished M100 certainly is
   affordable. In Canada, at the time of this post, Best Buy sells
   refurbished M100s for $390 CDN or about $293 US - and you might grab a
   used one for even less.

   Are the people here stuupid or something?
   Comparing this to Fuji XA7, which costs $700 when the Canon costs $150
   less. $700 is not entry level, that's midrange. This Canon is entry
   level.

   $150 is a lot of difference in the entry level segment. That's half a
   month worth of salary for some people in Asia.

   As many of us who have used the likes of the EOS M10, followed by the
   EOS M100, we can attest to the "fun factor" involved. In addition to
   superb APS-C IQ levels, whenever I reach for my M100, it becomes such a
   breeze to use. And when holding this camera, it almost defies logic
   that Canon managed to put an APS-C sized sensor in that tiny
   (pocketable) body. There are a multitude of options available in the
   menu structure even though it has a minimalist exterior body design.

   I don't know if I'd want to "upgrade" to this model over the M100, but
   it will still sell quite well (IMO, that is). And as usual - as if
   right on que - the self proclaimed naysayers (doesn't matter what brand
   of camera it is) - will knock this model for this or that reason. But
   that's life I suppose.
   As an M user, I can see this camera continuing to sell just fine,
   perhaps not to folks with the current M100, but more so for new users.
   All of the brands do these incremental upgrades.

   doing this in the near future, since they seem to be happy either with
   slower lenses or with bigger ones. The ef-m 22mm is excellent and makes
   my camera trully portable [I fit it in my back pocket]. And I m going

   If the camera had an EVF and was therefore being used at eye-level, a

   So this begs the question to Canon now: are we getting an update to the

   possible and the improvements made to the AF algorithm in the R, RP, M6
   Mark II could potentially be supported by the M50's Digic 8 as well.

   Grapejam - The M50 and M200 are aimed at completely different markets.

   The M50 is for photographers, most of who regard an EVF as essential
   (with one or two exceptions, such as street photographers).

   The M200 is aimed primarily at the selfie crowd, and at people who
   normally shoot on a smartphone, and prefer to view the scene on the
   rear screen).

   Neither are intended for anyone remotely serious about video. Video in
   most Canon cameras is just something they throw in to satisfy those who
   somehow think a camera without video is "incomplete". If you are at all
   serious about video, you should be looking at Panasonic, not Canon.

   @newworld666: I find it funny how Canon lovers defend this kind of

   And Yes the M6 is a very nice camera with great features, the first

   But when we look at Sony A7R4 the Canon M6 is pathetic with only 32.5
   MP. And the A9 can shoot 20FPS without much yellow effect in the
   pictures as the sensor is so damn fast. It does focussing very fast,
   and it has a lot of connection ports more (headphone, network etc) Oh
   and the battery life, The A9 is twice as long as with you M6!
   The A9 has a max mechanical shutterspeed of 1/8000 vs 1/4000 for the M6
   and a 1/32000 vs 1/16000 for the M6.
   And the A9 has a much larger sensor. So you are comparing apples with

   @AdamT: I fully agree with you, as my last sentence in my post shows.
   I see the M6 as a great little camera with its flaws (like the lack of
   an EVF, the crop in video, no 24fps etc.) But still an impressive
   camera, that indeed should be compared with the A6400.
   @jnd: The OP was comparing the M6 with the A9 and told that the A9 has
   a poor 24MP resolution.
   And when you reed my post you see that I find the comparison between
   these two cameras ridiculous.
   For the rest I called the M6 a very nice camera with great features,
   the first really exciting Canon update in years. But I like what Canon
   did with this camera, the sensor resolution is not very important for
   me at all.
   What most people forget is that the A9 has a resolution of 6000x4000
   and the M6 has a resolution of 6960x4640 pixels. So the resolution is
   only 960x640 more in every direction. So that is not much for cropping.
   I called the 32 MP pathetic compared to the A7RIV, and I do think that
   the 61MP overkill for most of us.

Canon's entry-level EOS M200 offers eye detection and 4K video

   Published Sep 25, 2019 | dpreview staff
   Share
   Tweet

   Canon has introduced the EOS M200, an entry-level mirrorless camera.
   It's a fairly modest upgrade to one of our favorite cameras, the EOS
   M100. Its new Digic 8 processor allows for Dual Pixel AF with eye
   detection, heavily cropped 4K/24p video and improved battery life.

   Everything else is the same as before: the M200 has a 24MP APS-C
   sensor, compact body with a selfie-friendly touchscreen and an
   easy-to-use interface.

   The EOS M200 will be available in October, bundled with the collapsable
   15-45mm F3.5-6.3 IS STM lens for $549/£499/€569.

   The EOS-M cameras are plenty but where's the lenses? The only lens I
   like is the 11-22mm. I can list at least five more really good lenses
   that's needed. None of the other zooms can match the 11-22mm.

   It's true. Except for the barrel distortion, the 11-22 is really good.
   I didn't find any of the others, including the 22mm, to be in the same
   league as the 11-22.

   It lacks a PASM dial and features that exist on much more expensive
   cameras yes; but as you say, it’s targeted at those with smaller
   budgets who don’t operate movie studios ... so what’s your beef other
   than just using this as an (unwarranted) opportunity to moan at Canon!
   This is actually a very good camera and for the many features it
   doesn’t have, it equally has many good ones of note!

   When the founding fathers made 16:9 aspect ratio, they never foresaw
   the absurdity of people shooting it in portrait mode. Sigh.

   Phones should default to 1:1 aspect ratio video capture. EOS-m200's as
   well apparently.

   Because people aren't making the decision on 9:16 or 16:9, they're just
   hitting the record button. If you can't trust them to understand it,
   shoot 1:1 and crop later.

   I trust people to notice that their subject fits in 9:16, but is
   cropped in half on 16:9. That's why most people actually shoot
   vertical, to fit their subject.

   Ironically the same reason we shoot stills in portrait orientation even
   though they will be viewed at less than half size on every monitor to
   fit.

   Same exact size as m4/3 smallest current camera. Too bad there is no

   M200 is $599. with kit lens. Not sure where you find $400. For entry
   level, probably one of the best values for a budget friendly 24MP apsc
   sensor camera.
   I had the m100 but traded up to a M6 where you can add a EVF if you
   like. I still liked the m100 but wanted the feature set of the m6 with
   its extra dials. m200 adds 4K although cropped not found on m100.

   As many of us who have used the likes of the EOS M10, followed by the
   EOS M100, we can attest to the "fun factor" involved. In addition to
   superb APS-C IQ levels, whenever I reach for my M100, it becomes such a
   breeze to use. And when holding this camera, it almost defies logic
   that Canon managed to put an APS-C sized sensor in that tiny
   (pocketable) body. There are a multitude of options available in the
   menu structure even though it has a minimalist exterior body design.

   I don't know if I'd want to "upgrade" to this model over the M100, but
   it will still sell quite well (IMO, that is). And as usual - as if
   right on que - the self proclaimed naysayers (doesn't matter what brand
   of camera it is) - will knock this model for this or that reason. It's
   par for the course and to be expected - sigh...

   As an M user, I can see this camera continuing to sell just fine,
   perhaps not to folks with the current M100, but more so for new users.
   All of the brands do these incremental upgrades.

   The sensor in it is the 24mp same as 80D, so it is NOT 5 years old. 80D
   was announced in 2016, so 3 years old but an excellent sensor. I sold
   my Sony A6000 to upgrade to a M100 and thought that was much better in
   performance. m200 has a few upgrades over m100 mainly just 4K. For the
   price, there is no EVF, if you want EVF go with m50 built in, but
   expect to pay more. m6 and m6ii you can add EVF.

   So, Canon is continuing with four different lens mounts: EF, EF-S,
   EF-M, and RF?

   This makes no sense to me at all. It might have disappointed folks, but
   Nikon stopped making the 1-mount series in July 2018 -- as Z became a
   thing -- and I really expected Canon would take some steps to shuffle
   EF-M users to an RF model (which could be an APS-C body with an
   EF-M-like form factor).

   i think the strategy canon is going for is that they will target low
   value customers with M and will provide cheaper cameras while they
   would milk customers (read 2500$ plus lenses etc) on RF mount.

   They are also doing this in case the business in one mount collapses
   then they would focus on another mount. For example M can go out of
   favour due to smartphones then RF survives on rich customers who want
   something to differentiate from smarphone crowd (also on amateurs and
   pros).

   They are playing safe and watching where future goes.

   miggylicious: EF was the first fully electronic mount, EF-S allowed
   lenses to extend back farther into the body (because the 1.6X crop
   mirror is smaller, hence doesn't hit), and RF is basically a full-frame
   mount allowing the flange to be about where EF-S glass went to. EF-M
   is, well, an attempt to copy Sony E? EF-M lenses are not adaptable to
   anything, while all Canon's others (including the old FL/FD/FDn) are
   adaptable to RF.

   If I were Canon, I'd fire sale EF-M stuff and give some type of
   discount to move to a 1.6X crop RF (which they haven't yet made but
   definitely should). I'd also be planning to discontinue EF/EF-S when
   the DSLR sales make them no longer worth the bother -- which,
   realistically, might take another decade.

   Lots of speculation, and Gesture has it right. The M series has been
   around since 2012 with with first m body, is in its 6th version bodies
   so far in m6. (counting m50 and m6ii and now m200) and there are over 6
   lenses with 3 primes, (including - 28mm macro prime, 32mm f1.4, 22mm
   f2) and 3 zooms (kit 15-45, 55-200, 18-150mm). Someone buying one of
   these bodies will probably only buy 2 to 3 lenses at most. So yes,
   enough lens for compact users. (Add an EFs/EF to M adapter for adding
   your existing lens.)

   This camera completes with Sonys A6xxx models, and a good alternative
   to m43 cameras. The m100, m50 and m6 are very good sellers, which is
   why new models are being released. It is easy to adapt EFs lenses to
   the m series with an adapter. The M series are meant to be a compact
   camera for use.

   This is a different market than the R cameras and RF lenses. The EF and
   EFs lenses are not dead, just slowly decreasing in sales each year, as
   mirrorless in R, and m series continue to grow.

   profhank: if you reuse the ef mount (with millions of lenses already
   available) for mirrorless, you will not have an issue with protruding
   ef-s lenses because it is already mirrorless. and using an adapter
   never gives the same feeling of a direct mounted lens. why not just
   make a mirrorless ef so that you won't need an adapter? and with the
   added space inside, canon could possibly add extremely useful features
   like an ND filter or large heatsinks to prevent overheating for videos.

   Actually thinking about it I suspect they could read all the pixels (as
   hard not to along a line) and scale them, they could read every other
   line but that would break bayer, so I assume they could read the whole
   sensor (16:9 crop that is) and just do the simplest scaling option of
   using 2x2 bayer blocks to make pixels and upscaling by 10-ish% to give
   4k.

   (The 16:9 crop is 6960 x 3904, making 2x2 pixels gives 3480 x 1952,
   which is about 10% off 3840 x 2160. Note the sensor/processor
   combination in the M6II can 30fps somewhat cropped Raws until it runs
   out of buffer, so reading the whole 16:9 area at 30fps is certainly
   possible..)

   Yeah but Fuji and Sony are downsampling from 6k video so that's just

   4:2:2 over HDMI but that is probably too much to hope for.

   I don't know what film cameras are doing but not downsampling from 6k
   just seems like inherently inferior to me. Of course they shoot raw and
   better colors, but with just a little bit of processing power you can
   get more detailed 4k images.

   Consumers who buy this type camera don't use viewfinders. They use
   these in the same way that they use a smartphone.

   If I had saved a penny for every person I’ve seen using live view when
   they really should have been using the VF, I could probably afford an
   M200 by now. (The worst one I remember was a guy trying very hard to
   hold a D850 and 24-70VR right in front of his face. Gawd what a waste
   of an awesome piece of gear!) Those people probably wouldn’t even
   notice the VF missing.

   Quiquae - what do you mean ‘should have been using’ - people shoot how
   they like, not how you think they should!

   photomam: this is a decent spec entry level pocket camera ... not a
   DSLR ffs ... it doesn’t need an EVF!

   @chadley_chad I see your relativist position and reject it utterly. Of
   course people are free to shoot how they like; that does not mean
   they’re doing it in a suboptimal manner, much less give you any right
   to tell me to shut up.

   The people I would have been saving pennies for were not trying to
   shoot at odd angles or on a tripod, where live view would have had
   distinct advantages. Rather they were shooting with the camera a few
   inches right in front of their faces, and they could have just as
   easily pulled the camera up to their face and shot with the viewfinder.
   Using the viewfinder would have given them more stable postures;
   eliminated screen glare; and in the case of the D850 guy, possibly the
   best ILC AF system in the world rather than one of the worst (Nikon’s
   DSLR live view AF being a bad joke compared to the OVF variety).

   Quiquae - I don’t recall telling you to shut up. What I was trying to
   say is that people can use their cameras in whatever way they see fit!
   I often hold my camera close to my face because, as a wearer of
   glasses, sometimes it’s just easier to use the LCD than taking off your
   glasses and using the EVF. I guess in your world I should be using
   contacts instead of glasses!

DULENS APO 85mm F2 is a new manual prime lens for Canon EF, Nikon F camera
systems

   [DULENS_85mm_F2_5.jpeg]

   A new Chinese optics manufacturer has released the DULENS APO 85mm F2,
   a manual medium telephoto prime for Canon EF and Nikon F camera
   systems.

   Although not much is known about DULENS itself, Newsshooter is
   reporting it’s been told that the optical engineer behind DULENS is the
   same who helped bring the NiSI F3 and MAVO prime lenses to life.
   [DULENS_85mm_F2_1.jpeg]

   The lens, which is inspired by the Zeiss Sonnar series, is constructed
   of seven elements in six groups and includes an Apochromatic element to
   reduce chromatic aberration. It measures 5.8cm (2.28in) long, weighs
   350g (12.35oz), features a 29-degree field-of-view, uses a 55mm front
   filter thread and has a minimum focusing distance of 90cm (35.43in).
   [DULENS_85mm_F2_3.jpeg]

   Below are a number of high-resolution sample images shared on the
   product listing. These were shot with the lens on a Lumix S1 using an
   EF adapter:

   The lens is available to pre-order in black and silver varieties for
   Canon EF and Nikon F camera systems. It’s currently listed for ¥2999
   (approximately $420) on Chinese retailer Taobao, but Newsshooter says
   the company intends to release the lens in the United States and Europe
   market for $599.

   We have contacted the retailer for more information on the lens and
   availability and will update this article if and when we receive a
   response.

   Interesting. But is it any better than the Nikkor 85/2.0 AiS I already
   have (and bought thirty years ago, used), on a D850? Does anyone know
   if it has the same optical construction? Better coatings?

   Ahh. No. Seven elements in six groups as opposed to five elements in
   five groups in the old Nikkor (which is great on b&w film, but not so
   good with 46 Mp).

   many Chinese lenses cannot pass the flashlight test. I see different
   types of dust inside some are ridiculously big. I don't have problem
   using Chinese made but they don't have pride of their products, such as
   terrible user instructions, no customer services and bad quality
   control. One most important thing is they're only after profits but
   done nothing worthy to the society or environment.

   - two elements made of glass with anomalous partial dispersion
   - three elements made of lanthanum glass (glass containing lanthanum
   oxide) and
   - one element made of glass with a high index of refraction.

   That's quite a lot of speciality glass!

   I think the ultimate test would be how it compares with the Canon EF
   85/1.8 and Nikon 85/1.8. At the same or lower price (depending on
   whether you can get the $420 china-only price), the native Canon/Nikon
   lenses support autofocus, are good optical performers, and have
   first-party compatibility with Nikon/Canon DSLRs.

   At its price point, it also competes with the used Nikon 85/1.4 AF-D.

   I don't see a niche for a $420-600 manual focus 85/2 unless it's
   stunningly good optically.

   Interesting mount choice. As much as I love shooting with DSLR, manual
   focusing on my Canon 5D is simply too painful, unless you use the live
   view screen. The mechanical design looks great, and it would be a great
   lens on mirrorless. Also, agree with most comments here about
   alternatives. The Canon 85/1.8 EF is only about 70g heavier, possible
   same sharpness if not sharper, has great ultrasonic manual/AF, and
   often available for about $400 new.

   Interesting comment, too. The 5D has no live view screen... only 5D
   Mark II or newer. The original 5D and the 5D Mark II can use EE-S
   screens, so focussing is a breeze with manual lenses. I kept my old 5D
   for the EE-S screen alone. It's fantastic.
   The mount choice is also nothing unusual as the original Sonnar Design
   was done for the 135mm film and therefor need a larger distance from
   the focal pane. Mirrorless would change that formula by some margins,
   so the effort would be higher to copy that for Sony or others.

   The price point of 600 USD is hard to justify considering the fact that
   you can buy a lens like the Meike 85mm f1.8 (a pretty sharp optic also
   equipped with AF) for a little more than 150 USD of the eBay. I'm using
   it with the official Canon EF adapter on the EOS R and I love the
   images coming out of it and the autofocus is working great (it's not
   the fastest or quietest I've ever seen but it gets the job done).

   While I certainly like the prospect of more native RF lenses reaching

   Yes, it's certainly pretty sharp wide open, I've never felt the need to

   stopping down to get as sharp as the center, but since most of the
   photos I've taken with have a blurred background it wasn't a problem
   for me.

   So, if this lens can produce the same level of sharpness in its corners
   as in the center, than it would make sense for it to cost more than the
   Meike. Only time will tell after we get to see more samples.

   There are apochromatic groups (made of at least three elements cemented

   360 photos and video can be very useful for certain applications (as
   well as having fun). The Vuze+ is an affordable 360 camera that
   supports both 2D and 3D (stereo vision) capture, and might be the best
   option for someone wanting to experiment with the 360 format.

   The EOS M6 Mark II renews Canon's commitment to making small,

   bursts and additional controls, it's a big step forward from its
   predecessor. And perhaps more interesting than the EOS 90D.

Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha 5G will pack a 108MP camera and wrap-around 'Surround
Screen'

   Xiaomi has officially introduced its Mi Mix Alpha, a 5G concept phone
   featuring a 'true' bezel-free experience. The phone has a massive
   180.6% screen-to-body ratio, meaning the display wraps around the edges
   of the phone and covers the majority of the device's rear panel.
   Similarly impressive is the device's 108MP camera with its 12032 x 9024
   pixel resolution.

   Xiaomi teased the Mi Mix Alpha's existence in early August at its
   Future Image Technology Communications Conference in Beijing. At the
   time, the company said it would be the first company to pack Samsung's
   108MP ISOCELL sensor into a smartphone, though it didn't provide any
   other details at the time.

     This is #MiMIXAlpha, a surround display 5G concept smartphone.
     Challenge the impossible, to make the future possible.

     — Xiaomi #MiMIXAlpha (@Xiaomi) September 24, 2019

   During its latest event today, Xiaomi introduced the camera that packs
   that sensor, its new Mix Mix Alpha with Surround Screen. This phone
   features aerospace titanium, a single power button on the top,
   pressure-sensitive sides, and a fingerprint sensor hidden underneath
   the display.

     Flip over #MiMIXAlpha and check out what happens.
     pic.twitter.com/q1wQNu4jnC
     — Xiaomi #MiMIXAlpha (@Xiaomi) September 24, 2019

   The Mi Mix Alpha is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ chipset
   alongside 512GB of storage and 12GB of RAM. Joining the 108MP sensor is
   a secondary rear 12MP telephoto camera with dual PD focus and 2x
   optical zoom. The phone doesn't feature a traditional front 'selfie'
   camera due also having a display on the back of the handset -- the rear
   camera is, technically speaking, a front camera as well.
   [MiMix.jpeg]

   Xiaomi describes the Mi Mix Alpha as a '5G concept smartphone.'
   According to Engadget, the company plans to produce a small number of
   units for sale in China at 19,999 yuan (approx. $2800 / €2,550)
   starting in December, but the company's broader plans for the model,
   including international availability, are unclear at this time.

   OK, maybe it is just me, because I don't see any utility in this
   design.

   A foldable phone makes some sense, because you end up with a much
   larger display screen when unfolded. But a "screen on both sides" phone
   doesn't seem to be useful for anything.

   There are lots of things people might pay more to get. Things like
   longer battery life, faster recharge time, better cameras, better
   screens, more durable bodies, etc. But I just don't think "screen on
   both sides" is one of those things.

   This is just a gimmick to show off something different.

   108mp on a 1/1.3" sensor? Heck, that would be like a thousand

   The Suwon District Prosecutor's Office charged 11 people on Thursday
   with stealing tech secrets from Samsung (SSNLF), the office said in a

   I doubt that they can even recover development cost for this device.
   At $3,000 (after taxes) is pushing it beyond too far.
   These Chinese phone companies seem to have forgotten their roots.
   Cheaper phones and very competitive prices were the main factors behind
   their survival and then growth.
   It makes far more sense to stay with what has worked in sustaining your

   This camera is insane. Personally I wouldn't use a Chinese smartphone,
   but I would want that camera in my phone. The crop factor compared to
   1" cameras is only 1.3. It's as close to high-end standalone compact
   cameras as APS-H was to full frame. And the aperture is f1.69, meaning
   a full-frame equivalent aperture of f/6! This is the largest aperture
   on any phone ever.

   Hell, this lens has an aperture larger than that of APS-C kit lenses.

   Well, f/6 is larger than what APS-C kit lenses offer at the long end
   but for the wide-angle end (which is what the 1/1.3" camera on this
   phone offers), f/3.5 (actual) and f/5.3 (FF equiv.) is still slightly
   larger.

   But with image stacking (for DR and SNR), the smartphone likely leaves
   APS-C kit lenses in the dust for image quality in regard to the sensor.
   Lens performance might still be better on the kit lenses. And image
   stacking almost always leaves you with an 8-bit JPEG which limits
   post-processing options considerably.

   Canon Eos M Aps-c cameras have f/3.5 at 15mm, but at the same field of
   view (should be ≈16mm) it might be rather f/3.6. The latest Canon Aps-c
   DSLRs even just have f/4 at 18mm.
   And the Xiaomi Alpha is equivalent to f/3.7 OIS on a Canon Aps-c
   camera, so Kristinn is right.
   Xiaomi's lens could be much better than Canon's 15-45mm at 16mm. Many
   copies of the 15-45mm suffer from extreme field curvature and
   especially at f/3.5 the 15-45mm suffers from at least one soft edge.
   The 15-45mm also has distortion and vignetting.

   To my understanding a dust particle on a large lens will affect the

   the image completely.

   What about »grease fingerprints« on the lens?

   B/c for now you only can flash out Xiaomi's firmware completely with

   Here is the good news, you may be able to flash out CCP Spyware from

   It's an f/1.69 lens. No smartphone can capture as much light per time.
   It captures approximately as much light per time as a Canon Aps-c
   camera + f/3.5 kit lens.

   The concept is neat but unless you're an alien with antenna eyes that
   can extend around the phone I'm not sure how useful having a screen on
   the opposite side is. Maybe so your friend can watch a YouTube video on

   To elaborate: Since it's a tesseract, you manipulate the phone only in
   the 4th dimension. So the problems mentioned about the 'wrap-around'
   sensitivity and viewing are solved - i.e., your hands are never on the
   phone in 3 dimensions.
   Brilliant solution.

   Not at all. Just like the 35mm format which is firmly ingrained in our
   heads, same with the vacuum tube unit of measure for sensor size.

   Most smartphone sensors are of size 1/2.3 inch or less, so if Xiaomi's
   is 1/1.33, then it is much larger than the norm.

   In fact, 1/1.33 inch is most likely the largest sensor ever to be
   featured on a smartphone so far.

   Yeah, why don't they call it 3/4" so we can compare it to 4/3" or 1"?

   I was realizing the other day that sensor manufacturers have fallen
   into discrete sizes all 4/3x bigger image circles than the last:
   1/1.8 (9/16"), 1/1.33 (3/4"), 1", 4/3", APS-C (~16/9"), but then
   "full-frame" jumps up 3/2x bigger than APS-C (~8/3", The biggest jump
   in this series), then the medium formats go back to smaller jumps.

   Just for clarification: These are just the names(!) of the sensor
   sizes. That's why it is called 1/1.33" type(!) sensor. A 1/1.33" type
   sensor is NOT (2.3/1.33)² times as large as a 1/2.3" sensor, there is
   no strict mathematical relationship between the name(!) and the real

   It is the diameter of the video vacuum tube which had a flat surface
   about the same size as the sensor. You will find almost all camera
   manufactures will also list the vertical and horizontal size in mm. In
   practice the diameter of most sensors is about 2/3rds that of the
   listed type value. At larger sensor sizes the trend is to use the
   corresponding film size, since video tubes were not made much larger
   than 4/3.

   The 108MP 1/1.33" ISOCELL sensor is 9.6 x 7.2mm with a 12mm diagonal
   and 4:3 format. Close to 16mm film. So relative to micro four thirds
   it's a 0.555x crop factor. Relative to Canon EF-S it's a 0.447 crop
   factor. Relative to full frame 0.27x crop factor.

   What's so hard about just listing width and height in whatever your
   unit of choice is?

   With video tube sizing, first you have to figure out what size the
   weird fraction actually is. (At least the numerators are normalized to
   1, but why are we even using fractions in the first place?) Then, you
   have to account for some fudge factor, and you *still* have no idea
   what the actual sensor dimensions are (just what diameter circle it
   roughly fits inside).

   But hey, according to this formula, my 20 year old scanner has a
   1/0.12" sensor! Who knew it was practically a large format camera?!
