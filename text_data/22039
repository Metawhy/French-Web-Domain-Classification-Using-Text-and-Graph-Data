My FAVORITE First Week Tradition

   I'm recycling an old picture from my first year teaching 3rd grade...
   which was in 2012!, to show you one of my favorite first week project
   traditions...
   During the first day of school I always have my students do this:
   1.)  I print each students' name in a bubble font.
   2.)  They color their names, cut them out, and glue them on
   construction paper... which they then cut aroud.
   3.)  I laminate them and hang them up so they are there on the 2nd day
   (usually!).
   4.)  They stay there all year long!
   [DSC04425.JPG]
   I love having this outside of our classroom!  It's an easy way to
   showcase your classroom family!
   I go back on Tuesday and am so excited!  Enjoy the long weekend and,
   those of you heading back for the first day on Tuesday with me... happy
   last weekend!

Sharing About Summer {A Back to School Must Read}

   I remember back to school shopping as a kid.  An entire day out with my
   mom and my sister, knowing we'd be going tout to lunch, trying on
   outfits, new shoes, a new backpack and a pencil box full of supplies.
   I would organize and re-organize that pencil box each night in the days
   leading up to the first day of school, making sure that the crayons,
   scissors, glue, and pencils fit just right.  Putting it into my
   backpack with the folders, notebooks, and ruler... getting everything
   perfect so I'd be ready for school.
   This is a fond memory for me, what can I say, I enjoy organizing
   stuff!  But, sometimes I will see something so small and realize how
   fortunate I am for the things I have in my life.
   Once, for example, years ago when I taught third grade, we were talking
   about our hopes and dreams for our futures.  Lots of my students wrote
   about career goals or experiences they wanted to have.
   One of my little girls wrote that her dream was to eat at Red Lobster.
   She had never been there, you see, and to her, this was the height of
   fine dining and the biggest thing atop her 9-year-old bucket list.
   I can go to Red Lobster on any random Tuesday, but this little girl,
   she had only ever left our little rural community a handful of times in
   her life so to go to the "big city" 30 minutes away and to even think
   about eating at Red Lobster, well, that was a big deal.
   It's things like this that make me go, "Wow."  I had a good childhood.
   Two parents who loved me, a sister to play with, dogs, trips, family
   memories.  And I'm so thankful for those good times!
   But, this leads me to summer vacation.
   We're all getting ready to go back to school.
   The bulletin boards are hung.  The name tags are ready.  Books are
   organized, copies are made, and soon, kids will be heading back to
   school!
   Some of them haven't gone on trips, made memories with their parents,
   or even known where their dinner was going to come from that night.
   Some have had to entertain themselves all day, walk to school where,
   thankfully, there's a free breakfast and lunch program running each
   day.  Some are coming in with clothing from last year because they
   didn't get to do that big "back to school shopping trip" that I always
   so looked forward to as a kid.
   They didn't get new supplies.  They didn't get new shoes.  They don't
   have a backpack.
   And, on the first day, when it's time to do that project where everyone
   writes and shares about their summer... they don't have those stories
   to tell about the family trip to the beach, the bonfire on the 4th of
   July, going shopping... even eating at Red Lobster.
   When thinking about inclusivity in our classrooms, making everyone feel
   valued and loved... how can we re-frame that traditional "tell about
   your summer" so that those kids who don't have stories to tell can
   still feel valued and included?
   This is just my two cents, but I hope that it will give our teaching
   community something to think about as it's almost time for that bell to
   ring!

Because Who Doesn't Love a Sticker Book?!

   Where my 80s babies at?  Collecting those Lisa Frank and Mrs. Grossman
   stickers... lovingly placing them in our sticker books and sitting back
   to enjoy that collection!
   Who doesn't love a sticker book?!
   That's why my students will be collecting stickers this year and I KNOW
   they are going to love it!
   [Picture1.png]
   Last year, I tied my individual student behavior system (Class Dojo) to
   a class store and students could cash in their points at the end of
   each week.  Sometimes they would save them, not spend them all, or just
   take a looooong time deciding what they wanted from the store.  Long
   story short, it became a lot for me to manage and took up too much time
   to have them shop.  So, it started happening every other week... and
   then only monthly.
   This year, I'm going to give a sticker to students who earn 5 or more
   Dojo points in a day and, when they have five stickers, they can choose
   something from the prize box.
   Easy peasy.
   I posted it on TpT in a fully editable format so you can set your own
   goals and use it for students who master math facts, behavior goals,
   any thing you can think of!  Or tie it to your behavior system you
   already have in place like I did!
   Check it out!

Oldie But A Goodie: Best Formative Assessment Game!

   [oldie.png]
   If you've been around this blog a while, you've seen me talk about my
   FAVORITE game before.  It's called "Back-to-Back" and it's the PERFECT
   way to get a quick check on how your students are doing on a concept.
   We use this weekly in my classroom and the kids absolutely love it.  I
   love that I can see who's got it and who needs more practice!
   Click the image below to check it out.  The two kiddos in this video
   were in 1st and 2nd grades when this was posted... they're such big
   kids now!

This Weekend's Cricut Projects

   I want to shout it from the roof tops and I don't care who knows it...
   I LOVE MY CRICUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
   Here is what I made this weekend.
   I found some vinyl at Wal-Mart and was so happy because it was less
   than $5 for the roll and it was Cricut brand!  As a newbie, I didn't
   look at the packaging carefully and ended up buying removable vinyl.
   At first, I was bummed.  But, then I realized that this is probably
   just the kind of vinyl I would need to use on my white board at school!
   So, I got busy making vinyl for different white board areas.  I have a
   floor to ceiling white board at the front and back of my classroom... I
   think each one is 12 feet long!  That's a lot of space for vinyling!
   (Think an image of Mr. Burns with his fingers together saying,
   "Excellent".  Me.  That's how I feel about this!)
   [Picture1.png]
   Check out LIVE THE QUOTE and MATH VOCAB on TpT!
   I bought one of those magnetic LED lights from Bullseye's playground
   for $3... I'm going to use it for a voice level display.  I tried first
   to put the words inside each number... but that didn't pan out.  So,
   now I'll place them below or next to when I put them on the board.
   [Picture3.png]
   Finally, I did something with PAPER!!!!!  This will go at the top of my
   back white board, I think!  I can't WAIT to be able to get into my room
   and put all of this stuff (and the box in my garage and the box in my
   office and the stuff in the back of my Jeep) up and away!

Math Vocabulary Cards- Organization and a Freebie!

   First of all, how is it August?!  This summer has flown by.  I've
   actually spent a lot of time relaxing and have spent a lot of time
   working on stuff for school, which is one of the ways I relax!
   The last few days I've been working on some math vocabulary cards.
   This was my situation earlier today...
   A mountain of laminated word cards to cut out.  Thank goodness for my
   little laminator though!  Its definitely gotten a workout this summer!
   [Picture6.png]
   Chum, my little helper, has been overseeing this project today.
   [Picture5.png]
   So, I cut out all of the word cards for each of the 8 math modules for
   2nd grade.  I hole punched them and put them on separate binder rings.
   [Picture4.png]
   Each card has a number on the bottom- this is the 2.7 ring.  That's for
   2nd grade Module 7!  This will make it so easy to sort them out and
   keep them organized!
   [Picture3.png]
   Then I thought I should make "covers" for each binder ring set.
   [Picture2.png]
   And, now my rainbow order obsessed heart is happy!
   [Picture1.png]
   You can get the first set of cards for FREE!  Doesn't matter if you use
   the same program as me or not... the cards can definitely be used with
   any math!
   Click the picture below to check out the bundle of all 8 modules.  You
   can find the Module 1 freebie there!
   [Picture6.png]
   And, maybe your kiddos are quicker at transitions than mine... but I
   found I was losing 4-5 minutes a day on math instruction due to
   transitions during our math workshop time!  I figured out a fix for
   this and a way to capitalize on those lost minutes to make the waiting
   meaningful!
   Check out these 284 MATH TRANSITION CARDS!

Character Development With Students

   How do you work on personal character development with your students?
   I do things like morning meeting, where we work on social skills to lay
   groundwork for character development.  We also focus on a skill each
   month at school, talking, reading, and learning about it.
   One thing I started doing last year was posting a quote each week in
   the classroom.  We would talk about it and learn what it meant to "live
   the quote".  My first graders would dialogue about the quote and dig
   deep to understand the meaning behind.
   At the end of each week, I would select one student who had "lived the
   quote" and they would get to take it home!
   [Slide6.PNG]
   [Slide7.PNG]
   We loved this and they were always eager to know who was getting our
   quote each week, sometimes guessing who it was because they started
   paying attention to who was living it!
   I have just posted the quotes in a pack on TpT with color and black and
   white quotes (I just copied mine on colored paper last year).  I also
   added a reflection sheet so students can explain what the quote means
   to them and describe how they can live it!
   [Slide8.PNG]
   It's on sale for the next 24 hours for $4.00 for forty quotes- five
   each on perseverance, integrity, respect, kindness, mistakes, empathy,
   friendship, and reading.  Be sure to check out the preview on TpT for 1
   quote free for each of the themes!
