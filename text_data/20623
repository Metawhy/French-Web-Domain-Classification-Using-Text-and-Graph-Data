A 2016 Prediction: Prescriptive Analytics Will Take Flight

A 2016 Prediction: Prescriptive Analytics Will Take Flight

   Author Ed GoldmanPublished on January 26, 2016May 10, 2017

   In May 2015, I wrote the first in a series of blog posts exploring the
   journey to software-defined infrastructure. Each blog in the series
   dives down into different stages of a maturity model that leads from
   where we are today in the typical enterprise data center to where we
   will be tomorrow and in the years beyond.  During that time, I also
   delved into the workloads that will run on the SDI platform.

   As I noted in last month’s post, traditional analytics leads first to
   reactive and then to predictive with the ultimate destination of
   prescriptive analytics.  This state is kind of the nirvana of today’s
   big data analytics and the topic we will take up today.

   Prescriptive analytics extends beyond the predictive stage by defining
   the actions necessary to achieve outcomes and the inter-relationship of
   the outcomes to the effects of each decision. It incorporates both
   structured and unstructured data and uses a combination of advanced
   analytics techniques and other scientific disciplines to help
   organizations predict, prescribe, and adapt to changes that occur.
   Essentially, we’ve moved from, “why did this happen,” to, “what will
   happen,” and we’re now moving to, “how do we make this happen,” as an
   analytics methodology.

   Prescriptive analytics allows an organization to extract even more
   value and insight from big data—way above what we are getting today.
   This highest-level of analytics brings together varied data sources in
   real time and makes adjustments to the data and decisions on behalf of
   an organization. Prescriptive analytics is inherently real-time—it is
   always triggering these adjustments based on new information.

   Let’s take few simple examples to make this story more tangible.
     * In the oil and gas industry, it can be used to enable natural gas
       price prediction and identify decision options—such as term locks
       and hedges against downside risk—based on an analysis of variables
       like supply, demand, weather, pipeline transmission, and gas
       production. It might also help decide when and where to harvest the
       energy, perhaps even spinning up and shutting down sources based on
       a variety of environmental and market conditions.
     * In healthcare, it can increase the effectiveness of clinical care
       for providers and enhance patient satisfaction based on various
       factors across stakeholders as a function of healthcare business
       process changes.  It could predict patient outcomes and help
       alleviate issues before they would normally even be recognized by
       medical professionals.
     * In the travel industry, it can be used to sort through factors like
       demand curves and purchase timings to set seat prices that will
       optimize profits without deterring sales.  Weather and market
       conditions could better shape pricing and fill unused seats and
       rooms while relieving pressure in peak seasons.
     * In the shipping industry, it can be used to analyze data streams
       from diverse sources to enable better routing decisions without the
       involvement of people. In practice, this could be as simple as a
       system that automatically reroutes packages from air to ground
       shipment when weather data indicates that severe storms are likely
       to close airports on the usual air route.

   I could go on and on with the examples, because every industry can
   capitalize on prescriptive analytics. The big takeaway here is that
   prescriptive analytics has the potential to turn enormous amounts of
   data into enormous business value—and do it all in real time.

   With the impending rise of prescriptive analytics, we are entering the
   era in which machine learning, coupled with automation and advanced
   analytics, will allow computers to capture new insights from massive
   amounts of data in diverse datasets and use that data to make informed
   decisions on our behalf on an ongoing basis.

   At Intel, we are quite excited about the potential of prescriptive
   analytics. That’s one of the reasons why we are a big backer of the
   open source Trusted Analytics Platform (TAP) initiative, which is
   designed to accelerate the creation of cloud-native applications driven
   by big data analytics.
