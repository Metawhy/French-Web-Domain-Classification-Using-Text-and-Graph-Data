DIY Eyelash Nail Art

   Who needs cupids and arrows when instead, you all you need is to wiggle
   your fingertips, painted with flirtatious eyelashes, at your beloved
   Valentine?! When we spotted this adorably sassy manicure on Hannah
   Bronfman, the queen of covetable nail art, we instantly had to recreate
   it. It wasn’t without some trial and error and a few strokes of the
   brush first. Practice makes perfect and we’ve perfected this one for
   you. Wink, wink.

   wink2

You’ll need:

     * black nail polish
     * #0 paint brush
     * 5/8″ wide washi tape
     * scissors
     * nail polish remover
     * cotton pads

   winknailsupplies

   Start by cutting 1 inch strips of washi tape. Cut a flat half
   circle out of the top of each one and tape them three quarter of the
   way down your nails. You can also put the tape all the way at the top
   of the nail, which will leave just a thin line.

   eyelashnails1

   Make sure the edge of the tape is adhered to your nails. Dab large
   dollops of black polish onto a thick piece of card stock. When picking
   a polish, it’s important to find a highly pigmented one – one that
   would only require a single stroke to get enough color. We like this
   one.

   eyelashnails2

   Using a very fine, high quality brush makes drawing fine lines much
   easier. I like using a #0 sable brush – they can be pretty expensive
   but if you clean them well, you can use them over and over again. Use
   the card stock to practice drawing lines and testing the pressure of
   your brushstrokes. Starting from left side of the nail, draw your
   curved line using the tape as a guide.

   eyelashnails3

   A tip is to put the weight of the brush against the tape side. Any
   excess of nail polish will spill over onto the tape, giving you a clean
   line on the nail.

   eyelashnails4

   Fill the brush with more polish and paint on lashes with 5 fine lines.
   Carefully peel away the tape.

   eyelashnails5

   If the brush is getting a bit clumpy or loosing its fineness, clean it
   between a cotton pad well soaked in nail polish remover. Continue the
   sane process on the rest of the nails.

   eyelashnails6

   To make an evil eye cut a piece of washi tape in the shape of a
   football, with the length matching the width of the top of your nail.
   Tape it right below your nail line. Trace the top and bottom line with
   nail polish.

   eyelashnails7

   Remove the tape and draw a circle in the middle, filling it in with
   polish. Allow one hand before starting on the next. And if you’re
   very ambidextrous, you can have a friend help you with the other set of
   nails. Allow to dry completely before applying a top coat.

   eyelashnails8

   Bat those eyelashes, ladies!

   wink

       I love this! Being a visual artist and a tactile person I love the
       idea of having eyes on your fingers. There is so much of the world
       I see through my fingers. I also imagine for blind people their
       fingers (and ears) become their eyes. The eye symbolism transcends
       so many meanings for people. I recently made these hand carved cast
       rings of the all seeing eye, eye of providence, 3rd eye, whatever
       you want to call it. It’s a universal symbol and anyone can adopt
       their own meaning to it. It serves a similar representation of
       having an eye on your finger.

       "The War Powers Resolution is transparently unconstitutional"How do
       you get that? Congress, as part of their exclusive power over the
       declaration of war, simply allowed 60 days for the President to get
       their approval for committing acts of war, to allow for the fact
       that getting nearly anything through the legislative process is
       slow.The power to tell a President to stop making war is a
       necessary part of Congress's exclusive power to declare war.

       elderly know how to choose colors and put on hats? Yeah, I think
       so.By taking their photos and by stating the obvious (“we spotted
       this woman and her beautiful pink sweater…”) the site objectifies
       seniors and makes them as dull as everyone else trudging down the
       chewing gum-caked sidewalks of New York City. Pathetic!

DIY Dried Flower Bouquet

   If you follow me on Instagram, you’ll know that I’m in a full fledged
   dried flower obsession. It all began when my local florist started
   selling a selection of vibrantly dyed bunny tail grasses. Intrigued by
   these gorgeous fluffy things, I took some home, along with some other
   wonderfully odd dried grasses and before long, my first dried
   arrangement was born.

DIY Ice Dyeing + Giveaway

   Ice dyeing. I’m officially obsessed. This unique method of tie dying
   has been on my to-do list for years – I’m actually surprised it’s taken
   me this long to finally have experimented with it! Zappos, who recently
   just launched a denim shop this fall, was actually the catalyst for
   this long overdue DIY. Did you know that ice dyeing was first conceived
   by quilters who were looking for a resourceful way to dye fabric during
   winter months?

DIY Wrapped & Knotted Wall Hanging

   The idea behind this tutorial is to wrap a cluster of that wonderful
   macrame cotton string, just as we did for the tassel wall hanging, but
   then knot and contort it into a vibrant wall hanging. My favorite part
   about this project is that it’s ever changing. You can form it however
   you desire and then change it up from time to time!

Lelet NY = Fall Hair Goals

   What I love most about fall is the return to classic and beautiful
   clothing. I love how everything feels more streamlined this time of
   year – less trendy, if you will. A woven sweater, a pair of high
   waisted jeans and one far too expensive, yet timeless, coat . . .
   there’s not much else that makes up the perfect fall outfit.

Reyna Noriega

   Artist Reyna Noriega‘s illustrated portraits of women are absolutely
   stunning and empowering. Not only are the compositions compelling, I
   love the way in which she combines muted, cool tones with earthy, warm
   hues.

     * Who says you can’t wear tie dye and hot pink in Fall?! .... I’ve
       been experimenting with ice dyeing and am absolutely obsessed.
       Thanks to @zappos’ newly launched denim shop, I recently got to
       play around with all kinds of white and light washed denim, the
       perfect medium for ice dyeing! It’s amazing what a bag of ice and a
       few ounces of dye can do . . . pure magic. ✨ I encourage you to try
       it! The tutorial is up on HWTF today. Tag your projects with
       #ZapposDenimDIY, @zappos and @honestlywtf and one of you will win a
       $500 Zappos gift card! Deadline is Oct 21st. Good luck and happy
       dyeing!! 🌈 #ad

Visiting the Lake District, UK

   Despite not knowing too much about the Lake District, I knew it was the
   most sensible place to stop on our way from Manchester to Edinburgh.
   After all, driving through the English countryside has been on the top
   of my bucket list for years. And finally, I got to experience it.
   Although, quite honestly, I would have appreciated at least a few more
   days to really absorb all of its beauty and history. The Lake District
   is best known for its lakes, forests and fells (mountains), and its
   associations with Beatrix Potter, John Ruskin and other English poets.
   Todd and I explored the southwest corner of the district, hitting up
   Windermere and Ullswater lakes . . .

GETTING THERE

   The Lake District is a surprising mere hour and a half drive from
   Manchester, so if you're brave enough to operate a vehicle on the other
   side of the road (thanks, Todd!), I highly recommend renting a car and
   experiencing the scenic route on your own time. However, give yourself
   plenty of time to get to your final destination (ours was Ullswater
   Lake) as you'll want to stop at all the quaint little towns along the
   way. Just northeast of Windermere Lake, the largest natural lake in the
   Lakes District and in England, you'll want to visit the tiniest village
   of Grasmere, home of the world famous Grasmere Gingerbread. Sarah
   Nelson invented Grasmere Gingerbread in 1854 in the village from where
   it gets its name and they've been continuing to make her biscuit like
   gingerbread the same way ever since. Grab some fresh gingerbread, take
   in the beautiful scenery and hit the road again!

STAY

   Set on northwest shores of Ullswater is Another Place, our final
   destination in the Lake District. The Georgian house, which was
   recently refurbished into a breathtakingly beautiful 40 room resort, is
   all about connecting guests to the surrounding elements by way of
   swimming, kayaking, paddle boarding, sailing, hiking, and cycling. I
   appreciate that the vibe here is anything but posh and exclusive,
   despite the incredibly stylish interiors and elegant ambience. Another
   Place is actually refreshingly laid back, casual and very family
   friendly, with an almost camp-like feel. I loved the different common
   areas, where guests could play board games fireside, enjoy the sunset
   over the fells with a cocktail, or just read a book poolside. I
   couldn't help but plan my next visit with my family.

EXPLORE

   There's a plethora of places to explore in the Lake District - I
   honestly believe you can spend weeks here and still not experience
   everything this region has to offer. There is one place, however, that
   must not be missed and that is the Stott Park Bobbin Mill. The 19th
   century bobbin mill, located southwest of Windermere Lake, once
   provided millions wooden bobbins to the ever growing textile, weaving
   and spinning industry in Lancashire and Yorkshire. Today, the mill is a
   working museum brought to life by tours and demonstrations run by
   English Heritage. It is, in one word, fascinating!

       AHHHH! This is so awesome! I’m hoping to go to the Lake District
       next year, but my husband wants to camp and do landscape
       photography there, rather than have a glorious tour. Haha. Maybe we
       can find a way to fit in both, but thanks for your guide, I’m
       definitely saving this for later!

Spotted: Bandanas

   The good ol’ Western bandana . . . its storied past and fixture in pop
   culture makes it one inexpensive and timeless accessory. As long time
   collectors of bandanas, old and new, we love how these super chic
   ladies (and men) styled them wrapped around the neck, tied up in the
   hair or swathed around the wrist. As much as we’ve devoted to the
   traditional paisley patterned squares, we’ve recently been digging
   these hand printed and hand sewn versions from Japan as of late.

       I love the classic look of wrapping them in hair, but with today’s
       fashion making them more modern means any girl can wear them and
       look great. Will definitely use a few of these for inspiration this
       spring.

Mara Hoffman Bridal Spring 2015

   Silk georgette and chiffon gowns with intricate beading,
   embroidered embellishments, braided fringe and subtle cutouts . . .
   leave it to Mara Hoffman to dream up a yet another non conventional,
   yet absolutely stunning collection of wedding dresses. Dresses as
   beautiful as ones with shimmering bodices, entirely beaded and so
   beautifully extended past the waist, make me wanna get married all over
   again.
