   Latest Saturn Portrait
   heic1917 — Photo Release
   Hubble Reveals Latest Portrait of Saturn
   The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope’s Wide Field Camera 3 observed
   Saturn on 20 June 2019 as the planet made its closest approach to Earth
   this year, at approximately 1.36 billion kilometres away.
   Exoplanet K2-18b (Artist’s Impression)
   heic1916 — Science Release
   Hubble Finds Water Vapour on Habitable-Zone Exoplanet for the First
   Time
   With data from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, water vapour has
   been detected in the atmosphere of a super-Earth within the habitable
   zone by University College London (UCL) researchers in a world first.
   K2-18b, which is eight times the mass of Earth, is now the only planet
   orbiting a star outside the Solar System, or exoplanet, known to have
   both water and temperatures that could support life.
   Globular Cluster NGC 1466
   heic1915 — Science Release
   Hubble Explores the Formation and Evolution of Star Clusters in the
   Large Magellanic Cloud
   Just as people of the same age can vary greatly in appearance and
   shape, so do collections of stars or stellar aggregates. New
   observations from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope suggest that
   chronological age alone does not tell the complete story when it comes
   to the evolution of star clusters.
   Jupiter’s Colourful Palette
   heic1914 — Photo Release
   Hubble Showcases New Portrait of Jupiter
   The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope reveals the intricate, detailed
   beauty of Jupiter’s clouds in this new image taken on 27 June 2019[1].
   It features the planet’s trademark Great Red Spot and a more intense
   colour palette in the clouds swirling in the planet’s turbulent
   atmosphere than seen in previous years.

   heic1913 — Science Release
   Hubble Discovers Mysterious Black Hole Disc
   Astronomers using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope have observed an
   unexpected thin disc of material encircling a supermassive black hole
   at the heart of the spiral galaxy NGC 3147, located 130 million
   light-years away.

   Latest Saturn Portrait
   heic1917 — Photo Release
   Hubble Reveals Latest Portrait of Saturn
   The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope’s Wide Field Camera 3 observed
   Saturn on 20 June 2019 as the planet made its closest approach to Earth
   this year, at approximately 1.36 billion kilometres away.
   Exoplanet K2-18b (Artist’s Impression)
   heic1916 — Science Release
   Hubble Finds Water Vapour on Habitable-Zone Exoplanet for the First
   Time
   With data from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, water vapour has
   been detected in the atmosphere of a super-Earth within the habitable
   zone by University College London (UCL) researchers in a world first.
   K2-18b, which is eight times the mass of Earth, is now the only planet
   orbiting a star outside the Solar System, or exoplanet, known to have
   both water and temperatures that could support life.
   Globular Cluster NGC 1466
   heic1915 — Science Release
   Hubble Explores the Formation and Evolution of Star Clusters in the
   Large Magellanic Cloud
   Just as people of the same age can vary greatly in appearance and
   shape, so do collections of stars or stellar aggregates. New
   observations from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope suggest that
   chronological age alone does not tell the complete story when it comes
   to the evolution of star clusters.
   Jupiter’s Colourful Palette
   heic1914 — Photo Release
   Hubble Showcases New Portrait of Jupiter
   The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope reveals the intricate, detailed
   beauty of Jupiter’s clouds in this new image taken on 27 June 2019[1].
   It features the planet’s trademark Great Red Spot and a more intense
   colour palette in the clouds swirling in the planet’s turbulent
   atmosphere than seen in previous years.

   Hubble Discovers Mysterious Black Hole Disc
   Astronomers using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope have observed an
   unexpected thin disc of material encircling a supermassive black hole
   at the heart of the spiral galaxy NGC 3147, located 130 million
   light-years away.

   The Sunburst Arc
   heic1920 — Photo Release
   Hubble Captures a Dozen Sunburst Arc Doppelgangers
   Astronomers using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope have observed a
   galaxy in the distant regions of the Universe which appears duplicated
   at least 12 times on the night sky. This unique sight, created by
   strong gravitational lensing, helps astronomers get a better
   understanding of the cosmic era known as the epoch of reionisation.

   Hubble Captures Cosmic Face
   In celebration of Halloween, this new image from the NASA/ESA Hubble
   Space Telescope captures two galaxies of equal size in a collision that
   appears to resemble a ghostly face. This observation was made on 19
   June 2019 in visible light by the telescope’s Advanced Camera for
   Surveys.
   Comet 2I/Borisov
   heic1918 — Photo Release
   Hubble Observes New Interstellar Visitor
   On 12 October 2019, the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope provided
   astronomers with their best look yet at an interstellar visitor — Comet
   2I/Borisov — which is believed to have arrived here from another
   planetary system elsewhere in our galaxy.

   Saturn on 20 June 2019 as the planet made its closest approach to Earth
   this year, at approximately 1.36 billion kilometres away.
   Exoplanet K2-18b (Artist’s Impression)
   heic1916 — Science Release
   Hubble Finds Water Vapour on Habitable-Zone Exoplanet for the First
   Time
   With data from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, water vapour has
   been detected in the atmosphere of a super-Earth within the habitable
   zone by University College London (UCL) researchers in a world first.
   K2-18b, which is eight times the mass of Earth, is now the only planet
   orbiting a star outside the Solar System, or exoplanet, known to have
   both water and temperatures that could support life.
