My Favorite 20 Nail Polishes of 2016

   This is it cookies, my last blog post! *tear* In case you missed it,
   please read this post as it explains my thoughts and feelings regarding
   retiring from the blog life. For today's post I wanted to share my
   favorite 20 nail polishes from this year.
   Press Sample | Purchased By Me

   There are way more than 20 that I loved of course, but these stood out
   just a bit more from the rest for one reason or another. The blog post
   where I reviewed each polish is linked with the shade name if you're
   interested. In no particular order, see all my picks after the jump!

OPI Holiday 2016 Breakfast At Tiffany's Collection Swatches & Review

   Hi there beautiful! I have the Holiday 2016 collection from OPI to show
   you today, the Breakfast at Tiffany's collection! This has to be one of
   my all time favorite movies, it's soooo good! There are twelve colors
   in the regular polish line and six in the Infinite Shine line, so
   you're in for a long post today because I'm giving them to you all at
   once, yay!
   Press Sample
   [opi-holiday-2016-breakfast-at-tiffany%2527s.jpg]
   Breakfast At Tiffany's is a pinky pale pearl with iridescent shimmer.
   Goes on a bit streaky, but evens out in three coats. This dries very
   fast because of the matte finish. I covered it with a top coat, I
   wasn't sure if it was meant to stay matte or not, but either way I
   prefer it shiny.
   OPI Breakfast At Tiffany's
   Apartment For Two is a vibrant raspberry pink crème. Very easy, smooth
   formula and opaque in two coats.
   OPI Apartment For Two
   Rich & Brazilian is a luxe and lustrous eggplant purple with tons of
   shifty shimmer and flakie particles. Went on a little uneven at first,
   but I got full coverage with two layers.
   OPI Rich & Brazilian
   I Believe In Manicures is a light blue crème, not quite Tiffany blue
   mind you, but similar. I believe there is a copyright on the exact
   Tiffany blue shade so no one can use it but them. This was quite thin.
   I almost got full coverage in two coats, however I needed three for
   complete opacity.
   OPI I Believe In Manicures
   Got The Mean Reds is a mid-tone red crème. This has a great formula, a
   one coater! I used two here like I usually do. This color is not
   particularly exciting to me personally, but I like the name.
   OPI Got The Mean Reds
   Black Dress Not Optional is a dark charcoal almost-black with a
   gossamer glaze of silver microshimmer. This was lovely to apply, thin
   but easy to manipulate. Slightly brushstrokey due to the shimmer, but
   these types of colors don't look bad with them in my humble opinion.
   OPI Black Dress Not Optional
   Meet My "Decorator" is a bright warm red jelly crème, squishy and a
   little bit streaky, surprisingly. I used three coats to get full
   coverage on this guy.
   OPI Meet My "Decorator"
   Sunrise... Bedtime! is a glitter bomb with a slightly pink tinted base
   filled with pink holographic glitter. Most people will probably layer
   this but I had to try to build it up to see if I could wear it on its
   own. Kinda thick and there may be some texture pieces in here, because
   it eats top coat like crazy. I put on three coats and it looks pretty
   great, blings so hard you probably wouldn't notice any open spots
   anyway!
   OPI Sunrise... Bedtime!
   Can't Read Without My Lipstick is a deep maroon jelly crème. Quite
   opaque with that shiny squishy quality I adore. Two coats.
   OPI Can't Read Without My Lipstick
   Five-and-Ten is a pale champagne foil with a pink tinge full of
   shimmer. I am in love with this, it's classy but still flashy! Makes me
   think of New Year's. The formula is on the thinner side and I needed
   three coats here.
   OPI Five-and-Ten
   Fire Escape Rendezvous is described as a matte glittering ruby.
   Assorted sizes and shapes of shard glitter pieces punctuate the base
   and make a chunky problem child. *sigh* I really, really don't
   understand why they keep trying this "glitter in a metallic base"
   formula thing. I had to shake this up a lot before I put it on because
   all the glitter pieces sink to the bottom. Dries matte, but I put on a
   thick shiny top coat (Pretty Serious Cosmetics Plump Up the Volume for
   the win!).
   OPI Fire Escape Rendezvous
   Champagne For Breakfast has a clear base filled with silver holographic
   glitter and maybe some texture particles, but I can't be sure. I
   layered one coat over Rich & Brazilian and I love it. I actually did
   try to get this opaque on its own, but after the fourth coat my nail
   bed was still peeking through pretty obviously. You could try the
   sponge method if you really want to wear it alone though.
   OPI Champagne For Breakfast
   Now on to the Infinite Shine colors! These are the first ones I've
   tried from OPI so I can't speak to their wear time or the difference in
   formula. They are a bit more expensive though, and are designed to be
   used with the Infinite Shine prep and top coat.
   Party At Holly's is a vampy, deep oxblood jelly crème. Quite opaque, I
   found this to be lovely and plush, and very shiny. Two coats.
   OPI Infinite Shine Party At Holly's
   Girls Love Pearls is a pearl white metallic. This is the shimmery, silk
   type of metallic, not a foil and not a frost. Very brushstroky, but
   surprisingly easy to apply. With two coats you can still kind of see my
   nail line but these type of colors look ok like that to me. I thought I
   was going to hate this, but I actually think it looks pretty good on
   me.
   OPI Infinite Shine Girls Love Pearls
   I Believe In Manicures is the only color that overlaps both polish and
   Infinite Shine. Almost identical to the polish version, it's a light
   blue crème but this one was a touch lighter and shinier. Seemed less
   streaky too, but I still needed three coats.
   OPI Infinite Shine I Believe In Manicures
   Can't Tame a Wild Thing is an orangey red jelly crème. Thin but easy to
   control, which I appreciate in a shade like this because no one wants
   to have to clean it out from under their cuticles, am I right? I used
   three coats for full opacity.
   OPI Infinite Shine Can't Tame a Wild Thing
   I'll Have a Manhattan is a midnight purple jelly crème. Another nice
   opaque formula, easy to apply and dries nice and shiny at two coats.
   OPI Infinite Shine I'll Have a Manhattan
   Ring The Buzzer Again is a scarlet jelly crème. On the thick side, but
   in a good way. I used three coats here because I could still see my
   nail line a little bit, but you may be able to get away with two.
   OPI Infinite Shine Ring The Buzzer Again
   OPI polishes can be purchased at professional salons and retailers like
   Trade Secret, Sally Beauty, and Ulta. Let me know what you think of
   this collection! I get what OPI was going for, classic colors for a
   classic movie, but I still wish they would've thrown in a few
   adventurous shades. Do we really need soooo many such similar reds?? I
   think not. Anywhoooo, my favorites are Breakfast At Tiffany's, Black
   Dress Not Optional, Party At Holly's, and Five-and-Ten. Tell me yours!
   Are you a fan of the movie too?

KBShimmer Office Space Collection Swatches & Review

   Hey folks, I'm here today to show you the next KBShimmer collection
   coming soon in January, the Office Space collection! “Sometimes you
   want to be a bit naughty, but stay within the professional lines. The
   Office Space collection consists of eight naughty and neutral shade
   ideas for the office. These shades add a pop of color and sparkle to
   your nails, while still keeping the boss happy." My job doesn't
   discriminate against any nail polish colors, thank goodness, but if
   they did, these colors would be a revelation!
   Press Sample
   Take Back CTRL is a dusty rose mauve crème. Leans purple but is on the
   border of the pink family I think. Excellent formula, buttery and
   smooth. Opaque in two coats.
   KBShimmer Take Back CTRL
   A Hint Of Manila is in the famous KBShimmer mega flame finish, this has
   a light tan base loaded with tons of holographic sparkle. A touch thick
   but not difficult to apply. This is two coats. Dries with a glitter
   texture so you'll want a thick layer of top coat or two for a smooth
   finish.
   KBShimmer A Hint Of Manila
   Staple Relationship is a deepened gray with slight purple undertones
   full of metallic silver flakes and holographic sparkle. This is in the
   KBShimmer birthstone finish, a favorite of mine. Super opaque, a one
   coater! I used two anyway though.The flakies dry flat so there is no
   texture to this one.
   KBShimmer Staple Relationship
   Caught On Tape is a pale pink mauve crème. This is simple and pretty,
   really classic. Lovely formula, really excellent for such a light
   color! And quite opaque, I only needed two coats.
   KBShimmer Caught On Tape
   Fax Of Life is a dark platinum grey linear holographic shade. I was
   pretty floored at how opaque this guy was, almost a one coater but I
   used two for 100% coverage. Easy and breezy and great!
   KBShimmer Fax Of Life
   Supplies Party has a warm vanilla cream base loaded with metallic
   flakes and holographic sparkle. Another birthstone finish shade with a
   great formula. An unexpected favorite, two coats.
   KBShimmer Supplies Party
   Cubicle Pusher is a muted dusty grape holographic. Great formula, just
   a little on the thinner side. I used three coats here but you could
   probably get away with just two, I think I was being cautious haha.
   KBShimmer Cubicle Pusher
   Makin’ Copies is a pale silver filled with white shimmer and
   holographic pigment. The holo in this is subtle, but it's definitely
   there. A bit more sheer, but being an almost white, that isn't really
   unexpected. I used three coats here.
   KBShimmer Makin' Copies
   This collection will launch on Wednesday, January 4th on the KBShimmer
   website. The polishes will sell for $9.25 each. For international
   folks, check out Harlow & Co., though I'm not sure what date they will
   be available there. Let me know what you think about these neutral
   beauties!
