Description

   Envie de quelques chose de different ?
   Optez pour le nouveau “DEVIL”, float tube SEVEN BASS au look
   inimitable, qui possèdent une assise et un dossier gonflables.
   Confortablement assis au dessus du niveau de l’eau, vous allez profiter
   de vos parties de pêche. Deux sangles réglables modifient l’inclinaison
   du dossier pour s’adapter à toutes les morphologies.
   Sa forme en V, diminue la résistance à l’eau lors de l’avancement et
   améliore la manoeuvrabilité du float tube. Ces «V» sont constitués de
   chambres à air indépendantes équipées de valves de sûreté, et gonflées
   individuellement pour une sécurité maximum. L’ensemble de la zone de
   contact avec l’eau est en toile cordura 900D, très épaisse et quasiment
   indéchirable, tout comme le reste du float. Deux énormes poches zippées
   permettent de ranger aisément vos boîtes à pêche et tout le matériel
   nécessaire.
   De nombreux anneaux vous permettent d’attacher vos divers accessoires.
   Tapis de réception gradué. Le pêcheur bénéficie d’un espace de stockage
   derrière le siège qui accueillera à merveille un Bakkan étanche.
   Charge max : 113 kg.
   • Vendue avec float tube et Carryall

Description

   Envie de quelques chose de different ?
   Optez pour le nouveau “DEVIL”, float tube SEVEN BASS au look
   inimitable, qui possèdent une assise et un dossier gonflables.
   Confortablement assis au dessus du niveau de l’eau, vous allez profiter
   de vos parties de pêche. Deux sangles réglables modifient l’inclinaison
   du dossier pour s’adapter à toutes les morphologies.
   Sa forme en V, diminue la résistance à l’eau lors de l’avancement et
   améliore la manoeuvrabilité du float tube. Ces «V» sont constitués de
   chambres à air indépendantes équipées de valves de sûreté, et gonflées
   individuellement pour une sécurité maximum. L’ensemble de la zone de
   contact avec l’eau est en toile cordura 900D, très épaisse et quasiment
   indéchirable, tout comme le reste du float. Deux énormes poches zippées
   permettent de ranger aisément vos boîtes à pêche et tout le matériel
   nécessaire.
   De nombreux anneaux vous permettent d’attacher vos divers accessoires.
   Tapis de réception gradué. Le pêcheur bénéficie d’un espace de stockage
   derrière le siège qui accueillera à merveille un Bakkan étanche.
   Charge max : 113 kg.
   • Vendue avec float tube et Carryall

   Float Tube fishing is gathering more and more enthusiasts. The resons
   for that are plain to see. Float tubes offer several advantages:

   temperatures
   • In order to ensure maximum safety, users should wear a life vest Pour
   un maximum de sécurité, le port du gilet de sauvetage est important
   • Users should make sure they're familiar with local regulations
