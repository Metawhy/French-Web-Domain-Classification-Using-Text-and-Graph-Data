   to take advantage of Washington, D.C., and a commitment to social
   justice.

   Learn more about applying to our undergraduate and graduate schools and
   programs.

   for admission. Georgetown’s commitment to meet 100 percent of the
   demonstrated financial need of each undergraduate who merits admission,
   through scholarships, loans and other forms of assistance, means that
   every accepted undergraduate student can afford to enroll. Each year
   more than half of Georgetown undergraduates receive some form of
   financial assistance.
