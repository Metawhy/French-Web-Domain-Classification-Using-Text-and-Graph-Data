   so in style?

   In case you didn’t know, we’re running a crowdfunding campaign to Buy
   shark conservation legend David Shiffman a less ugly pair of sunglasses
   (and also to support some amazing shark conservation programs. So head
   on over to our Indiegogo page, where you can find some excellent perks,
   like 3D printed megalodon teeth!

Do it for the Sharks!

   so in style?

   shark conservation legend David Shiffman a less ugly pair of sunglasses
   (and also to support some amazing shark conservation programs. So head
