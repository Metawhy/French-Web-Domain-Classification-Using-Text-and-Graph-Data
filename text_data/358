   This recipe came up on my Pinterest feed and since I'm always looking
   for stuff that fits my new way of cooking for my husband's diabetes
   (I've also stopped eating nearly all sugar and carb-y stuff) I gave it
   a try. For the first go it was surprisingly tasty, and even though my
   husband confessed that he was a little afraid at first--because, you
   know, "lentil soup"--he was happy to eat leftovers.
   Changes I made include using more chicken broth than in the original
   recipe, adding a bit of water (not in the original recipe), using more
   garam masala than in the original recipe, and not using the jarred
   roasted red peppers. The peppers just seemed weird to me. I also used
   coarsely chopped baby kale because that's what my store had, so
   simmering the stew after adding it ended up being too much, and it lost
   it's gorgeous bright green color. Next time (if I use the baby kale
   again) I'll add it after turning off the heat and just let the heat of
   the stew wilt it a bit. I guess I also used double the amount of kale
   than in the original recipe. Because I love kale. Oh, and I added
   garlic. Because I love garlic.
   There is a note in the original recipe that you can try adding curry
   instead of the garam masala. I think that would also be really good,
   and you could probably add a variety of different herb combinations for
   nice variations.
   Lentil, Sweet Potato, and Kale Stew (adapted from Mezzetta.com)
   printable recipe
   2 tablespoons olive oil
   1 small onion, diced
   1 rib celery, sliced
   1 carrot, diced
   2 cloves garlic, minced
   2-3 teaspoons garam masala
   1 cup green lentils, rinsed well
   6 cups chicken or vegetable stock
   1 cup water, if needed
   1 medium sweet potato, peeled and 1/2-in diced
   2 cups chopped baby kale
   salt and freshly ground pepper
   1. Heat the olive oil in a medium sauce pan over medium to medium-low
   heat. Add the onion, celery, carrot, and garlic. Cook, stirring often,
   until the vegetables start to brown a bit, 8-10 minutes. Add the garam
   masala and cook for another 3-5 minutes.
   2. Add the lentils and chicken stock, and bring to a boil. Cover,
   reduce the heat to maintain a simmer, and cook for 10 minutes, stirring
   occasionally. Add the sweet potato and simmer an additional 10-15
   minutes, or until the lentils and sweet potato are tender. ***This is
   where you may or may not need the water. Add it in if the stew looks
   too thick; if there isn't enough liquid the lentils won't cook
   properly***
   3. Stir in the baby kale, remove the pot from the heat, and allow the
   kale to wilt for about 10 minutes. (If you are using mature kale,
   simmer for 5-7 minutes.) Season with salt and pepper.
   Makes 4-6 servings.

   My last post, Basic Pressure-Cooker Beans, was sort of a "part 1" for
   this post. You can eat the delicious, healthy black beans you made in
   your pressure cooker as is, or you can make these homemade refried
   beans (of course, you can use pinto beans instead, if you want). I like
   to make my own refried beans for many of the same reasons I like to
   make my own beans from dry: it costs less, I control how much salt is
   in them, they have a better flavor, and I don't have to wonder if the
   can has BPA in it. Also, I can freeze the refried beans so they can be
   just as convenient as canned from the store.
   Note: I use a food processor, but you can also mash them with a potato
   masher if you want. It will take longer, but it will also work (a good
   kitchen job for your kids ;)
   Homemade Refried Black Beans
   printable recipe
   1 lb dry black beans
   1 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
   1 teaspoon chili powder
   1 teaspoon dried oregano
   1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
   1/2 teaspoon onion powder
   1. Cook the dry beans in a pressure cooker (method HERE).
   2. Drain the cooked and cooled beans, reserving 1/4 cup cooking liquid.
   Combine the drained beans, cumin, chili powder, oregano, garlic powder
   and onion powder in the bowl of a food processor. Alternately pulse,
   scrape down the sides of the bowl, and run the processor until the
   beans are smooth. Add the reserved bean cooking liquid 1 tablespoon at
   a time to achieve the consistency you want.
   Makes about 3 cups of beans.

   I know this picture isn't sexy, but knowing how to have dry beans
   cooked and ready in less than an hour is very sexy. And useful. (Ok,
   Some bigger beans might take a little over an hour, but not much more.
   So still sexy, and still useful ;)
   Here are the reasons I like to make my own beans from dry: it costs
   less, I control how much salt is in them, they have a better flavor and
   texture, dry beans last a long time (read "forever") in my pantry, and
   I don't have to wonder if the can has BPA in it. Also, I can freeze the
   cooked beans--whole or processed smooth--so they can be just as
   convenient as canned beans from the store.
   Basic Pressure-Cooker Beans
   printable recipe
   1 lb dry beans
   2 quarts water
   1 tablespoon salt
   1. Combine the dry beans, water, and salt in your pressure cooker; put
   on the lid and lock it down.
   2. Bring to high pressure following the instructions for your unit,
   reduce the heat to maintain the pressure, and cook for 45-55 minutes.
   Let the pressure come down on it's own. Voila! Cooked beans.
   Makes about 7 cups cooked beans.
