Exclusive: Google plans second-gen ‘Nest Mini’ w/ built-in wall mount, better
sound, aux jack

   Google plans to launch a followup to 2017’s Google Home Mini with a
   second-generation ‘Nest Mini,’ a reliable source tells 9to5Google. It’s
   a departure from the previous model in name, but also a substantial
   upgrade in features. This year’s Nest Mini will pack a wall mount,
   better sound, and more.

   Google confirmed at Google I/O 2019 that the Google Home line of smart
   speakers would eventually get the same Nest-centric brand that debuted
   alongside the Nest Hub Max, and we can confirm that ‘Nest Mini’ will be
   the new name for the smaller of the “Google Home” trio.

   The device’s physical form factor will not be a major departure from
   the first-gen Google Home Mini. The Nest Mini will be roughly the same
   size — perhaps slightly larger — and still has much the same
   functionality. It’s a small speaker meant to bring the best of the
   Google Assistant at a low, entry-level price point.

   There are some feature additions to be expected with this upgrade,
   though. Our source indicates that the new Nest Mini will have improved
   sound, with higher maximum volume and better bass and quality overall.
   We’re also told that the Nest Mini will bring a built-in wall mount,
   but it’s not clear yet how yet — it could simply mean a groove on the
   back for hanging the new Mini on a screw like a picture frame. Third
   party wall mounts for the current-gen device have been exceedingly
   popular.

   Another interesting addition with the second-generation Nest Mini is a
   3.5mm stereo jack. While the port has quickly disappeared from
   smartphones, the Nest Mini will now be in line with the Amazon Echo
   Dot, which has featured an aux jack since its first generation. It’s
   not clear if this will be used for audio input, output to external
   speakers (a de-facto Chromecast Audio replacement), or both.

   Finally, we’re told that the device will have some kind of proximity
   awareness. Other Google hardware devices, like the Nest Hub Max, Nest
   Guard and Nest Protect have various motion sensors, the likes of which
   would seem more likely than the Soli chip that Google has confirmed
   will be included in the forthcoming Pixel 4. Regardless, these are said
   to reveal the current volume when you approach it.

   We’ve heard there are new colors in the plan for the refreshed Nest
   Mini, but no details yet. We don’t have word on pricing, but it’s
   probably safe to assume the same $49 as the last model.

   Google is expected to hold its annual Made by Google hardware showcase
   later this fall, and we’re expecting the already-confirmed Google Pixel
   4 to make an appearance alongside this new Nest Mini. Other
   announcements are likely in the cards, too, so stay tuned as we learn
   more.

Google says its update software is crashing some Macs, here’s how to fix

   Earlier today, Mac video professionals began reporting that their
   computers were crashing, and many attributed the problem to Avid’s
   Media Composer editor. The issue instead lies with a piece of Google
   software that helps keep Chrome up-to-date.

   Version 1.2.13.75 of Google Keystone (Google Software Update) recently
   shipped with a bug that damages the macOS file system on computers
   where System Integrity Protection is disabled. Also known as SIP, the
   OS security feature helps “prevent potentially malicious software from
   modifying protected files and folders on your Mac.” This issue also
   affects Macs that do not support SIP (pre-OS X El Capitan).

   Google tells us that it has paused the roll out of Keystone 1.2.13.75
   until a solution is developed. The company recommends taking the
   following steps to recover a machine affected by the bug until a fix is
   in place. (Update: Google this evening has issued new commands after
   running further tests.)

     chroot /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD [note: “Macintosh HD” is the default]

     rm -rf
     /Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle

     mv var var_back # var may not exist, but this is fine

     ln -sh private/var var

     chflags -h restricted /var

     chflags -h hidden /var

     xattr -sw com.apple.rootless “” /var

   Those Terminal commands will specifically remove the affected version
   of Google Software Update, and then restore the damaged portion of the
   file system. A system reboot is then needed. Users need to perform
   these steps in Recovery Mode, and root credentials are required.

   Several Mac administrators have compiled a more technical explanation
   of what’s happening and the underlying issue that’s not related to Avid
   after all. Video professionals were particularly affected as System
   Integrity Protection has to be disabled to allow for third-party video
   card support. The majority of users should be unaffected as long as SIP
   is enabled, which is the default setting.

     1. After rebooting the affected system it would Kernel Panic. The
     system will reboot only to KP again

     2. User Logs out and the system shows the Setup Assistant.

     3. The System Kernel Panics into a boot Loop.

   Chromebooks are great because they auto-update to protect users against
   viruses and add new features as well. However, Google has a strict
   cut-off date for providing those updates. Out of the blue, Google
   recently gave several Lenovo Chromebooks a new lease on life with three
   more years of updates.
