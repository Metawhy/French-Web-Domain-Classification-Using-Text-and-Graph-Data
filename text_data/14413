The Blog Is Moving - Update Your Bookmarks

   Hello crafty friends!

   As I've mentioned, I've been working on some backend improvements and
   updates lately, including new hosting a new home for the blog. Over the
   last couple of weeks I've been preparing the new & improved Wplus9
   Design Blog. With 10 years of posts, this blog will stay up, but will
   no longer be updated.

   Our new address is blog.wplus9.com.

   Be sure to head over and update your bookmarks. The address may have
   changed, but the welcome is the same!

Easy Copic Outlining ft. He Is Risen w/Kelly

   Hello Crafters! Spring is here!!!

   I'm so excited for warmer temps, grass, flowers to start blooming,
   warmer temps...you hear what I'm saying. I'm so tired of being cold
   ya'll.

   I decided to ring in Spring with a Simple but colorful Easter card.
   [wplus9_HeIsRisen_kellyLatevola6d.jpg]

   I combined our Modern Calla Lillies set with the He is Risen set to
   create this sweet bouquet. The coloring was inspired by my friend Jana
   Millen. I saw a card of hers where she used simple outlines to add
   color to her images and absolutely loved it!. You can see her card
   here.
   [wplus9_HeIsRisen_kellyLatevola6b.jpg]

   I started by creating a tone on tone background for my flowers to POP
   off of. I used the large background stamp from He is Risen to stamp in
   Nautical Navy on Nautical Navy card stock. That's a mouthful ha! But it
   gives a gorgeous tone on tone look which I adore.

   Next I stamped out all of my flowers and leaves and went in with my
   copic markers. Since it's just outlining the images the coloring goes
   so fast! Originally I started with lighter colors but I could not get
   them to photograph well to save my life.
   [wplus9_HeIsRisen_kellyLatevola6c.jpg]

   This is the original color scheme. Because photography can be so tricky
   the dark background kept making my flowers look almost completely
   white. In real life the card had much more color. In order to fix that
   I went back into the card with slightly darker colors.

   You can watch the entire card in all it's stages in the video below.

   I still like the original color scheme the best. After seeing the
   photos do you think I should have left well enough alone?

March 2019 Release: Welcome Wreath

   It's no big secret that I'm a sucker for a wreath stamp set. And the
   new Welcome Wreath stamp set is no exception!
   [wp9_WelcomeWreath_1d.jpg]

   There are several layers that you can choose from to create your wreath
   - use as few or as many as you'd like. Also included in the set are
   little flower clusters and berries which allow you to customize the
   wreath seasonally.

   I had so much fun playing with this set and once I got started, I just
   wanted to keep stamping more and more wreaths, trying out different
   layers and color combinations. In the video below I share more about
   this set and how to build the wreath.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/epUTD21czYE?rel=0

   Watch above or watch in HD at YouTube

   For the first card, I stamped the wreath layers in Wplus9 PURE COLOR
   dye inks in Warm Wool and Lime Light, and Distress Oxide inks in Mowed
   Lawn and Faded Jeans. In the video, I made two versions and embellished
   them a little differently, but this design looks just as beautiful
   without any extra embellishing too.
   [wp9_WelcomeWreath_f1a.jpg]

   For all but one of my cards today, I stamped the card base in Warm Wool
   using the Wood Planks stamp set.
   [wp9_WelcomeWreath_1b.jpg]

   For the next card, I stamped the wreath layers in Warm Wool dye ink and
   Evergreen Bough and Candied Apple Distress Oxide inks.
   [wp9_WelcomeWreath_4b.jpg]

   I choose to highlight the Evergreen Bough in this one. I ink blended a
   bit onto white card stock to create my own custom color, and then die
   cut the bow in the Welcome wafer die from it.
   [wp9_WelcomeWreath_4a.jpg]

   For the sentiment, I cut a 1/4" strip from the card stock and heat
   embossed my sentiment in white.

   For the next card, I decided to switch it up a bit and used the tighter
   wood plank pattern image from Wood Planks and stamped it in our White
   pigment ink onto Dove Grey card stock.
   [wp9_WelcomeWreath_3a.jpg]

   I stamped the wreath layers in Warm Wool and Last Leaf dye inks, and
   Evergreen Bough and Fossilized Amber Distress Oxide Inks. I used the
   same technique of creating custom colored card stock as my previous
   card and again, die cut a bow from it.
   [wp9_WelcomeWreath_3c.jpg]

   For my final card today, I want to go really soft and ethereal.

   I stamped the wreath layers in Warm Wool and Last Leaf dye inks,
   Evergreen Bough Distress Oxide ink and then for the final layer, I used
   WOW! glitter embossing powder in Singing in the Rain.
   [wp9_WelcomeWreath_2a.jpg] [wp9_WelcomeWreath_2d.jpg]

   For the sentiment, I again, created custom colored card stock, and used
   the Welcome wafer die to die cut the "hello" sentiment. To give it a
   little bit more dimension, I stacked several of the die cuts, adhering
   one on top of the other.
   [wp9_WelcomeWreath_2c.jpg]

   I hope that you enjoyed this closer look at these new March 2019
   products! I'll be back soon with more from this release.

   Thanks for dropping by!
