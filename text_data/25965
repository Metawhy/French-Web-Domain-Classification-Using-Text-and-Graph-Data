Exhibition 'Vectors and diseases' [leaflet_exhibition_vectors_p1.png]

   What do plague, malaria and chikungunya have in common?

   These diseases and many others—or more precisely the causal agents
   responsible—are spread by 'vectors'. A vector is a transmission agent
   for microscopic organisms that cause diseases; these are spread to
   humans and animals by biting.

   The exhibition shows a broad range of vectors and also discusses the
   research conducted by scientists to gain better knowledge of them in
   order to organise control.

   MediLabSecure

About the project

   Countries of the Mediterranean and Black Sea regions have common sea
   borders and, as a result, share common public health issues and
   threats.

   The MediLabSecure project aims at consolidating a Laboratory Network on
   the emerging viruses that are pathogens for humans and/or animals.

   It represents a cluster for awareness, risk assessment, monitoring and
   control of these vector borne diseases. This cluster will require the
   interaction of four laboratory sub-networks, one for human health, one
   for animal health, one for entomology and one for public health
   reinforcement.

   The MediLabSecure network encompasses partner countries around the
   Mediterranean and Black Sea Regions (19 non-EU countries) by means of a
   collaborative execution of the stated work packages to address public
   health-related national needs.

GENERAL OBJECTIVES

   MediLabSecure is a European project (2014-2017) aiming to:
     * Create a framework for collaboration to improve surveillance and
       monitoring of emerging vector borne viral diseases (arboviruses)
     * Provide training for public health experts in participating
       countries to increase the communicable disease control in the
       Mediterranean and Black Sea region.
     * Promote knowledge development and transfer of biosafety best
       laboratory practices

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES

   Prevent spread of viruses and concerned vectors (mosquitoes):
     * Prevent outbreaks of zoonotic viruses with an existing identified
       or potential risk in the region (West Nile, Dengue, Chikungunya,
       Yellow Fever, Rift valley fever, …)

     * Improve integrated surveillance (animal, human, entomological)

     * Provide risk assessment of the different emerging viruses
       (transmission, spread, human impact…)

     * Recommend and implement public health measures for control where
       possible

   [network_with_countries_names.png]

FUNDING

   MediLabSecure is a continuation the “EpiSouth plus” project
   (2010-2013). The project is funded by the European Union

03/2019 - Publication strategic document

   The MediLabSecure strategic document on "Integrated surveillance and
   risk assessment for arbovirus infections: recommendations for enhancing
   One Health in the Mediterranean Region" has been published.

   Carried out by the Public Health working group, this document aims to
   contribute to the strategies for the prevention and control of
   arbovirus infections with a One Health approach, by focusing on
   integrated surveillance and multisectoralrisk assessment.

   The integrated surveillance systems of three countries of the Network
   (Serbia, Georgia and Tunisia) have been described and assessed with a
   MediLabSecure situation analysis study (MeSA Study). The relevant
   results and lessons learned provided by the studies and activities
   implemented in four years of the MediLabSecure Project (2014-2017) have
   been reported and discussed in this strategic document, including
   recommendations for future actions.

   This strategic document has been recognized by the public health
   community as an important tool to facilitate the assessment of
   integrated surveillance systems and to enhance the operationalization
   of One Health strategies in national health policies and regional
   contexts.

Kick-Off Meeting

July 2-3,  2019, paris, france

   The Kick-Off Meeting of the new phase of the MediLabSecure project  was
   held on July 2nd-3rd 2019 at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, France.

   [picture_kom_2.png]

Objectives & Content

   The Kick-Off Meeting was the opportunity to officially launch the new
   phase of the MediLabSecure project with a presentation of its
   objectives and activities.

   Gathering 110 participants from more than 25 countries (representatives
   from participating countries, partners, stakeholders and funder), this
   2-day event successfully initiated the integration of the 5 new
   countries members from Sahel. It also allowed to introduce the 2 new
   components with the inclusion of the Veterinary Services in the network
   of Public Health officials, and the integration of environmental and
   ecological features in the development of emerging infections' risk
   assessment and early warning tools.

   The meeting consisted in plenary sessions along with parallel sessions
   to discuss in details the foreseen activities. Other networking events,
   including also representatives from complementary EU-funded projects,
   were organized to stimulate and promote interactions with a One Health
   spirit.

   In line with the CBRN CoE initiative, this meeting contributed to put
   the second phase on track for the next 3 years, to increase the project
   impact and empower its sustainability towards strenghtening
   preparedness against vector-borne diseases in the Mediterranean, Black
   Sea and Sahel Regions.

ExPERTISE counters

   To enhance networking and intersectoral exchanges during the meeting,
   an "expertise counters" session was scheduled during the lunch break of
   the second day.

   During this activity, MediLabsecure work package leaders animated a
   counter to exchange on specific aspects of their work package. Besides,
   representatives from related EU-funded projects (STRONGLABS, MediPIET,
   Infravec2 and LeiShield-MATI) also participated in this interactive
   session to present their projects and explored possible collaborations
   with the audience.

   [picture_kom_expertise_counters.png]

   All posters presented during this session are available here.

VECTOR GAME

   An icebreaker activity, mimicking a vector-host interaction, was
   scheduled during the meeting to welcome and facilitate exchanges
   between experienced and new members of the MediLabSecure network.

   As a vector, the new MediLabSecure members from Sahel had to find a
   host to feed from their MediLabSecure previous experience by completing
   a form. The first three "vector-host interactions" to bring back the
   complete form won the game.

   Congratulations to the winners!
