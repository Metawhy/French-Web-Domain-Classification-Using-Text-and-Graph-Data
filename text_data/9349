   Why Improving Customer Experience Is So Hard In Healthcare - One of the
   most frequent topics of conversation in healthcare today, and often
   somewhat controversial depending on who you are speaking with, is the
   notion of improving the customer experience (CX). For some, perhaps
   it’s just top of mind given the number of traditionally
   customer-centric companies trying to pave a new path forward in
   healthcare including Walmart, Amazon, and CVS. But for those of us who
   have grown up in healthcare, we know this conversation isn’t new. Read

     “It’s the must-attend meeting for healthcare executives interested
     in the on-demand healthcare space.”

About the Symposium

   On-demand medicine is now strategic and is leading a customer
   experience revolution in healthcare. It is a mass market that, if
   managed with a retail and hospitality mindset, can become a funnel for
   bringing new customers into a health system, increasing or protecting
   market share, boosting overall patient satisfaction and acting as a
   change agent for an entire organization. Since 2008, this conference
   has gathered healthcare leaders into a community around the increasing
   “consumerization” of medical care. People who attend this event want to
   be on the cutting edge of this movement.

The Audience

   The symposium brings together approximately 150 senior executives with
   an interest in on-demand medicine, most of whom are senior leaders from
   health systems, large medical groups and large urgent care chains with
   a 3- to 5-year planning horizon. We also invite executives from health
   plans, private equity, and academia to further build a dynamic
   experience and community around the on-demand healthcare space.
