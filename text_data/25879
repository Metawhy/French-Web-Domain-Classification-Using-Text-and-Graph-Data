Top 10 VPN Services

   Today you can find an ideal service that will fit your needs. It will
   both easy to use and affordable. You’ll feel more secure than ever
   before!

   You might think: ‘’That’s all good, but before I pay any money for
   services, I have to be sure in their quality and benefits!’’

   That’s why we reviewed Virtual Private Network services and their
   software from the technical expert’ s point of view. Later, when making
   the ratings, we took into account their prices. That’s why cheap and
   weak services haven’t been included in our Top VPN list.

   Without any further ado, let’s dive into details.

1. SURFSHARK – New, Fast, Cheap


   Well, let me introduce Surfshark!

   a sharp lookout for Surfshark for a long time and now I rank it high on
   our list of the best VPNs.

2. NordVPN – Incredible, Reasonable, Universal


   NordVPN review
   Get NordVPN


   It’s one of the most prominent services in 2019. It was introduced in
   2008. In addition to usual services, it offers a VPN server chaining.
   It possesses over 5000 servers. Any doubts?

   Then have a look at its popularity among users (according to Google
   Trends). It beats all! It excels its nearest rival in popularity twice!

   NordVPN popularity

   What does influence such growth? It’s easy – the price, a vast number
   of servers in 62 countries and high-grade service.

   Take note of NordVPN features:
     * 5000+ servers globally;
     * Double VPN (facility to use VPN server chaining);
     * encrypted WiFi;
     * available on Google Play Market and App Store;
     * settings for any platform;
     * fast speed;
     * works with Netflix and other streaming services;
     * torrents support;
     * superior security;
     * AES-256 encryption algorithm (it is also used by the US special
       services);
     * no leaks;
     * Kill Switch function (protection when a secured connection is
       lost);
     * advantageous jurisdiction. Panama laws protect NordVPN against
       legal pressure;
     * full version for the 30-day money back;
     * 6 multi logins;
     * according to one of user comments on Play Market in January, the
       app needs a lot of energy after the last update;
     * the refund procedure needs much time (there are services which
       offer 5-7 money-back guarantee).

   Pricing
     * 1 month – $11.95 per month
     * 12 months – $6.99 per month
     * 2 years – $4.99 per month
     * 3 years – $3.49 per month

   I like NordVPN very much. It has passed technical testing successfully
   and proved high-level stability of software. I reckon the disadvantages
   are temporary and unessential.

   The official website is www.nordvpn.com.

3. EXPRESSVPN – Utmost Safety and Quality


   ExpressVPN review


   Founded in 2009, ExpressVPN (visit official website) – is one of the
   first large-scale services.

   According to Google Trends data, the popularity of the service is
   second only to NordVPN.

   But the confirmed “No Logging” policy, the easiest initial set-up of
   the app and excellent customer support make ExpressVPN number one.

   ExpressVPN popularity

   ExpressVPN does NOT keep information on when and what website you
   visit. The fact of evidence was the case in Turkey in 2017.

   Take note of ExpressVPN features:
     * doesn’t keep logs;
     * 2000+ global servers (unlike 400-500 on average in the market);
     * user-friendly to the greatest possible extent;
     * encrypted WiFi;
     * available on Google Play Market and App Store
     * settings for any platform;
     * fast speed;
     * works with Netflix and other streaming services;
     * torrents support;
     * superior security;
     * AES-256 encryption algorithm (it is also used by the US special
       services, study the Wikipedia article);
     * no leaks;
     * Kill Switch function (protection when a secured connection is
       lost);
     * advantageous jurisdiction. Offshore territory (British Virgin
       Islands) protects ExpressVPN against legal pressure;
     * full version for the 30-day money back;
     * Split Tunneling (facility to use some apps without a
     * 5 multi logins (other providers usually offer more);
     * the registration is required to acquaint oneself with the plans.

   Pricing
     * 1 month - $12.95 per month
     * 6 months - $9.99 per month
     * 15 months - $6.67 per month

   My colleagues from BestVPNRating and I have been using ExpressVPN for a
   long time already. I recommend this service because of its
   multipurposeness and safety.

   The official website is www.expressvpn.com.

4. CYBERGHOST – Great, Modern, Good Price


   CyberGhost review

   What I like about CyberGhost is its up-to-date character. At the
   present time, it introduces a new service in the VPN market – Smart
   Rules. “Set your own Smart Rules and automate your privacy. Wi-Fi rules
   available now. More coming soon!” – is stated on the official site.
   What else? 7 simultaneous connections and superior security. Also, this
   service will be convenient for the users who need a dedicated IP.
   CyberGhost offers this additional function.

   The service has been working since 2011 and took the leading positions
   for a long time. For the last year, it was pressed by other providers.
   And now it the third most popular service according to Google Trends:

   most popular service

   Take note of CyberGhost features:
     * over 3700 servers worldwide;
     * facility to use a dedicated IP;
     * Smart Rules (updated privacy settings);
     * Encrypted WiFi;
     * available on Google Play Market and App Store;
     * settings for any platform;
     * Netflix server;
     * works with torrents and doesn’t hesitate to highlight it on its
       site;
     * top-level security;
     * AES-256 encryption algorithm (it is also used by the US special
       services);
     * no leaks;
     * Kill Switch function (protection when a secured connection is
       lost);
     * advantageous jurisdiction. There is the data protection association
       in Romania;
     * full version for the 45-day money back;
     * 7 multi logins;
     * only $2.75 per month when choosing a 3-year plan;
     * there are servers with slow speed;
     * a 1-month package is expensive.

   Pricing
     * 1 month – $12.99 per month
     * 12 months – $5.99 per month
     * 2 years – $3.69 per month
     * 3 years – $2.75 per month

   CyberGhost is one of the cheapest providers available (when choosing a
   3-year plan). I recommend this service for the users who want to
   unblock Netflix, to connect many gadgets simultaneously and to use a
   dedicated IP.

   The official website is www.cyberghostvpn.com.

5. PIA – US-based, Cheap, Fast, Multipurpose

   PIA review

   Founded in 2010, PIA (Private Internet Access) was a hands-down winner
   in the sphere of

   security services right up to 2017. As PIA has many servers, we rank it
   number 5. It is a good, large-scale, time-proved VPN. It has
   consistently cheap prices, fast speed and P2P-friendly servers.

   The ‘’tricky parts’’ I’ve found are SOCKS5 proxy and ad blocker.

   But my Netflix tests were unacceptable. Besides, having studied Android
   users’ reviews, I’ve found out many complaints against the support
   service and app crashes.

   Google Trends demonstrates interests over the past year:

   Google Trends demonstrates interests over the past year

   Take note of PIA features:
     * 3225+ servers in 33 countries;
     * fast speed;
     * SOCKS5 in addition;
     * blocks ads, trackers, and malware;
     * encrypted WiFi;
     * available on Google Play Market and App Store for most countries;
     * supports Netflix but works worse than the rivals;
     * works with torrents;
     * choice of the encryption algorithm;
     * no leaks;
     * Kill Switch function (protection when a secured connection is
       lost);
     * 10 multi logins;
     * the US jurisdiction;
     * 7-day money-back guarantee (many providers allow making use of
       refund for 30 days and more);
     * popularity decreased in 2016;
     * ad blocker doesn’t work in the application;
     * complaints against the support service.

   Pricing
     * 1 month – 9.99 per month
     * 12 months - $5.99 per month
     * 2 years - $3.49 per month

   I recommend this service to the users who aim at surfing the Internet
   without ads on a PC. But I don’t advise to use it on smartphones.

   The official website is www.privateinternetaccess.com

6. IPVANISH – Popular American VPN service

   IPVanish review

   Being introduced in 2012, IPVanish stands out from the rivals because
   of the faster speed and SOCKS5 protocol in addition to the service. The
   provider takes a positive view towards torrenting. Moreover, it’s
   possible to use 10 devices simultaneously. It is ranked number 6
   because IPVanish offers fewer servers than other providers do. Besides,
   the US jurisdiction allows only a 7-day money-back guarantee.

   In the US and couple more countries it is ranked second in popularity
   after NordVPN, as for the rest of the world – it is not in the top.
   Considered all, it goes like this:

   Considered all, it goes like this

   Data is taken from Google Trends.

   Take note of IPVanish features:
     * 1100+ VPN servers in 60+ countries;
     * fast speed;
     * SOCKS5 protocol;
     * encrypted WiFi;
     * available on Google Play Market and App Store for most countries;
     * supports Netflix;
     * works with torrents and doesn’t hesitate to highlight it on its
       site;
     * AES-256 encryption algorithm (it is also used by the US special
       services);
     * no leaks;
     * Kill Switch function (protection when a secured connection is
       lost);
     * 10 multi logins;
     * the US jurisdiction (read about ‘’14 eyes’’);
     * 7-day money-back guarantee (many providers allow making use of
       refund for 30 days and more).

   Pricing
     * 1 month - $10 per month
     * 12 months - $6.49 per month
     * 3 years - $3.70 per month

   I’m in the dark about how to use torrents and have trust in no-log
   policy (it is mentioned on the official website) when using IPVanish.
   Being subject to the jurisdiction of the US, the service has to carry
   out the laws which are antithetical to torrents and ‘’No Logging’’
   policy. In other respects, it is a very good VPN provider that copes
   with many tasks.

   The official website is www.ipvanish.com

7. VYPRVPN – Swedish VPN. Best Performing Protocol

   VyprVPN review

   VyprVPN is owned by Golden Frog, a well-known company engaged in IT
   security since the beginning of the 1990s. Its long experience provided
   an opportunity to work out a special product. They offer a proprietary
   Chameleon technology which serves to bypass restrictions of the
   countries where a standard protocol OpenVPN is blocked.

   Besides, it offers a 3-day free trial version.

   The basic parameters of VyprVPN are high-level. Many reviews caution
   that VyprVPN keeps logs for 30 days. That is no longer the case. The
   company does NOT store logs. It has been proved by a third-party
   company, which has performed an audit and declared that personal
   information is not collected by VyprVPN.

   However, I don’t recommend to use it for torrents. Despite the fact
   that it does not prohibit torrenting, there are cases when the accounts
   were blocked in consequence of intellectual property rights violation.

   Google Trends demonstrates little interest in VyprVPN for the last year
   worldwide:

   Google Trends demonstrates interest in VyprVPN

   At the same time, VyprVPN is in the first place in Indonesia, Mongolia,
   and Columbia.

   Take note of VyprVPN features:
     * 700+ servers in 70+ global locations;
     * fast speed;
     * there is a protocol to prevent VPN traffic blocking (not for all
       plans);
     * risk-free 3-day trial;
     * VyprVPN Cloud (dedicated cloud server);
     * encrypted WiFi;
     * available on Google Play Market and App Store for most countries;
     * supports Netflix (look through a positive review on Reddit);
     * works with torrents but an account can be blocked in response to a
       complaint of the right-holder;
     * AES-256 encryption algorithm (it is also used by the US special
       services);
     * no leaks;
     * Kill Switch function (protection when a secured connection is
       lost);
     * no logs;
     * high-quality support service;
     * 3-5 multi logins (it depends on a plan);
     * no information on a refund;
     * relatively low popularity.

   Pricing
     * 1 month – $9.95 per month (no Chameleon, 3 devices, no VyprVPN
       Cloud)
     * 1 month – $12.95 per month (Chameleon, 5 devices, VyprVPN Cloud)
     * 12 months – $5 per month (no Chameleon, 3 devices, no VyprVPN
       Cloud)
     * 12 months – $6.67 per month (Chameleon, 5 devices, VyprVPN Cloud)

   Well, the service is flavorful. However, VyprVPN Cloud is barely of
   use. It’s more like a marketing hook. I recommend this service to those
   who tried more popular

   providers but haven’t manage to bypass blocking.

   The official website is www.vyprvpn.com.

8. PUREVPN – 140 Countries, Diverse Methods of Payment

   PureVPN review

   Founded in 2007, PureVPN is located in Hong Kong and is the leader in
   the market if take into account the number of countries where the
   provider places its servers. I’ve counted 140 countries. It supports
   torrents, allows using a dedicated IP and offers an unprecedented
   number of payment methods.

   It might take the 3rd place in our rating but for some serious
   shortcomings.

   I haven’t managed to access Netflix. Many servers have shown
   insufficient speed despite the fact the service introduces itself as
   the fastest in the world. There are Android users’ reviews which inform
   about insufficient security level. Although it is claimed that the

   Virtual Private Network service is compatible with iOS, I haven’t found
   an application for iOS on App Store!

   Google Trends reports that the popularity of PureVPN is insignificant.

   Google Trends reports that the popularity of PureVPN

   Take note of PureVPN features:
     * 2000+ VPN servers in 140 countries;
     * many payment methods (not all are refundable);
     * facility to use a dedicated IP;
     * speed depends on location;
     * encrypted WiFi;
     * available on Play Market;
     * works with torrents (official website of the service states that
       all servers are P2P-friendly);
     * 5 multi logins;
     * 31-day money-back guarantee;
     * location outside ‘’5 eyes’’ and ‘’14 eyes’’ alliance;
     * Split Tunneling (facility to use some apps without a VPN
       connection);
     * not available on App Store;
     * failed Netflix tests;
     * weak security level (IP leak is possible, Kill Switch doesn’t work
       properly).

   Pricing
     * 1 month - $10.95 per month
     * 3 months - $8.00 per month
     * 12 months - $3.33 per month

   I recommend PureVPN to the people who want to make use of unusual
   payment method, exotic countries and torrenting sites.

   I don’t recommend PureVPN to those who appreciate the security and want
   to unblock Netflix. Also, you can’t use this

   application on iOS, as it is unavailable on App Store.

   The official website is www.purevpn.com.

9. TUNNELBEAR – Free Package is Available

   TunnelBear review

   TunnelBear was found in 2011. Its distinctive feature is a free package
   with the traffic limited to 500MB per month.

   McAfee has become the owner of the service since 2018 (learn more about
   McAfee on Wikipedia), which guarantees high-level security. The
   provider undergoes a regular independent audit.

   Unfortunately, it doesn’t support Netflix, the speed is not fast, and
   the number of servers is poor.

   Besides, it is not compatible with routers, which makes TunnelBear
   unattractive to the advanced users and companies.

   The interest to TunnelBear, as reported by Google Trends, can be
   compared with the interest to CyberGhost:

   The interest to TunnelBear, as reported by Google Trends

   Take note of TunnelBear features:
     * encrypted WiFi;
     * available on Google Play Market and App Store for most countries;
     * works with torrents;
     * AES-256 encryption algorithm (it is also used by the US special
       services);
     * no leaks;
     * Kill Switch function (protection when a secured connection is
       lost);
     * 5 multi logins;
     * Canadian jurisdiction (‘’5 eyes’’ alliance);
     * 20+ countries;
     * no money-back guarantee (many providers allow making use of refund
       for 30 days and more);
     * slow speed;
     * doesn’t unblock Netflix.

   Pricing
     * 1 month – for free (500MB traffic per month)
     * 1 month - $9.99 per month (no limits)
     * 12 months - $5.00 per month

   A free package is a good attempt to attract new consumers.

   But 500MB! Is this for real?

   You’ll use it to watch an HD video for no more than 30 minutes. I
   reckon it to be a marketspeak. That is why I can rank this provider
   number 9 only, despite the high-class security.

   All the more so as the speed and server network leave much to be
   desired.

   The official website is www.tunnelbear.com.

10. ZENMATE – German VPN. Free Plan is Available

   ZenMate review

   ZenMate offers a freemium plan with the speed limit. But hold off on
   using it. This plan is not available in the app, the speed is 2 Mbps
   (when connecting to the Internet through 3G) and only four locations
   are available. A paid ZenMate plan is more advantageous. Fast speed,
   many supported devices, the feasibility of using Netflix and torrents,
   a wide range of locations.

   Among the minuses of its packages are possible IP leaks and logs
   keeping.

   The popularity of ZenMate is rather high cross the globe (according to
   the data of Google Trends), but it decreases:

   The popularity of ZenMate is rather high cross the globe

   I associate it with a quite good free VPN package.

   Take note of ZenMate features (paid packages):
     * about 300 servers in 30+ countries;
     * fast speed;
     * encrypted WiFi;
     * ad free (for Ultimate plan);
     * available on Google Play Market and App Store for most countries;
     * compatible with any device;
     * works with torrents (for Ultimate plan);
     * unblocks Netflix;
     * AES-256 encryption algorithm;
     * no leaks;
     * Kill Switch function (protection when a secured connection is
       lost);
     * 5 multi logins;
     * German jurisdiction (‘’14 eyes’’ alliance);
     * keeps logs;
     * IP leaks are possible (low-grade security);
     * no money-back guarantee (many providers allow making use of refund
       for 30 days and more);
     * troubles with the app.

   Pricing
     * 1 month – for free (speed limit – 2MB/s, compatible with PC, 4
       locations)
     * 1 month - $11.99 per month (no restrictions)
     * 12 months – 3.99 per month
     * 2 years - $2.05 per month

   I recommend this service because of its package with unlimited traffic.
   But remember there are other restrictions! I don’t recommend to pay for
   it. There are services with better characteristics at this price. For
   example NordVPN or CyberGhost.

   The official website is www.zenmate.com.

Is VPN legal?

   VPN is an absolutely legal technology. Still, Web-censoring countries
   have expanded banning and blocking of Virtual Private Networks.
    1. In the United Arab Emirates VPNs that don’t comply with the local
       laws are officially banned (see Federal Law No. 12/2016).
       Nevertheless, lots of citizens and tourists use VPN in the UAE. The
       services aren’t blocked and work properly.
    2. In Oman traffic encrypting can be applied only if it is approved by
       the authorities. However, VPNs are regularly used there.
    3. In Iran one can use only those VPNs that are approved.
       Nevertheless, with the help of reliable services people overcome
       both geo- and censorship restrictions.
    4. According to The Register, since 2014 Iraq has been blocking VPNs.
    5. In Egypt VPNs are not illegal, but the authorities often block the
       IP addresses belonged to VPN servers. That’s why you’d better use a
       VPN service with a large number of locations such as ExpressVPN,
       NordVPN, or Surfshark.
    6. In Turkey there isn’t any law to punish the use of VPN, but the
       authorities have already blocked some online VPNs as it’s reported
       in Turkey Purge.
    7. In China the government has started issuing fines for VPN use, and
       among the first was a user of Lantern VPN. However, according to
       Freedom House, in 2018 about 20-30 million people used VPN in
       China.
    8. In Russia there’s a law banning the use of services to bypass
       geo-restrictions. But currently, it is actively used in the
       country.

   Besides, we have the information about possible problems with VPN in
   Uganda, Turkmenistan, Venezuela, and Belarus.

   In the rest of the countries, VPN use is absolutely legal.

More about VPN

Real IP address masking

   A VPN network hides real IP addresses of any device in a reliable way
   (further reading about IP in Wikipedia), and it’s the VPN server’s IP
   that will be defined, while yours will stay hidden. It’s a useful
   function, isn’t it? It’s even more useful if you use torrents or want
   to bypass geo-restrictions and stream with Netflix, Hulu, or other
   Streаming Video Services.

   Moreover, you may have other reasons to surf the Internet anonymously.
   Nobody can define your IP, and consequently – your real geo-location,
   while you are connected to Virtual Private Network.

   There are certain vulnerabilities connected with IP leaks that may
   occur as a result of non-perfect functionality of VPN apps. But more on
   that later.
     __________________________________________________________________

Different VPN servers (locations)

   Faking your IP, a VPN network uses its servers located worldwide. There
   are both popular locations included in the list of almost every
   provider, and the ones which are difficult to find.

   In case the list of countries where servers are located is important
   for you, have a look at it before purchasing (the example of the
   location list from www.expressvpn.com).

   We recommend you to choose a provider with lots of different locations.
   As a rule, having tried a VPN network once, people use it for years.
   That’s why a wide choice of servers will probably come in handy in
   future.
     __________________________________________________________________

Data protection

   It’s a very important feature for VPN connections. In 2019 the best
   rated VPN services offer the most modern and reliable methods of
   encrypting that can’t be cracked nowadays. For example, according to
   the article from Wikipedia, ExpressVPN applies AES-256 encryption that
   has been recognized as the encryption standard for TOP SECRET
   information in the US.

   Moreover, there’s an opportunity to choose an encryption algorithm.

   Traffic encrypting makes internet connections secure. Even if you
   connect to public Wi-Fi networks, you’ll be able to send any
   confidential data in a secure way. Your logins and passwords won’t be
   intercepted.

   Besides, online payments are much more secure with VPN.
     __________________________________________________________________

VPN speed

   Taking into account the nature of VPN connections, internet speed will
   be lower if you are connected to Virtual Private Network.

   Depending on the settings and your ISP’s opportunities, internet speed
   will be reduced at 30-40%, or even at 50-60%. For example, if your ISP
   offers internet connections at 30 mbit/s, your VPN speed may be reduced
   to 20 mbit/s.

   Nevertheless, you should ensure that VPN features and tariff plans fit
   your needs, even if your Internet is very fast. Moreover, think twice
   if you need a VPN for streaming HD video.

   That’s why the best way is choosing a fast VPN from our Top 10 or look
   through speed test results in our reviews of 180 services.
     __________________________________________________________________

Apps for PC, Mac, Android, and iOS

   In 2019 there’s no need to know how to set up software and configure it
   to work with your VPN provider. Currently, a good service offers
   user-friendly apps, which are easy to set up.

   Need apps for PC, Mac, iOS, or Android (read review "Best VPN for
   Android")? No problem. You just need to subscribe, install and launch
   the software by one click.

   Unfortunately, not all services offer reliable and safe apps. That’s
   why we recommend you to consider the ratings at Bestvpnrating.com and
   choose a VPN from the best ones.
     __________________________________________________________________

VPN disconnect protection (Kill switch)

   It’s a very important function if you care about your safety and
   anonymity. For some reason, the encrypted VPN tunnel can break. But a
   good VPN client will disconnect the Internet to avoid leaking of your
   intelligible data and personal information. A protected connection will
   recover automatically when a VPN server is accessible again.

   In case a VPN server remains unavailable, you’ll be able to change a
   VPN location securely.

   Kill switch is not offered by all providers. Before any purchase,
   carefully study our VPN reviews and take use of the top services
   according to BestVPNRating.com.
     __________________________________________________________________

IP/DNS leak protection

   Leak makes it possible to define personal information despite using a
   VPN.

   DNS leak occurs when you use domain names, and visiting sites, your
   computer or gadget first contacts a DNS server to learn the IP of the
   website. Your ISP’s DNS is usually used, that’s why it’s easy to define
   your geo-location.

   IPv6 leak is connected with two types of IP addresses: ‘’short’’ and
   ‘’long’’. ‘’Long’’ IPs are used as the number of ‘’short’’ ones is
   limited which leads to two ‘’parallel’’ networks. It’s impossible to
   perform a VPN connection for both networks mentioned above. That’s why
   one can know your real IP address.

   WebRTC leak is related to P2P video transmission technology. WebRTC
   poses risks to anonymity as this connection bypasses Virtual Private
   Network.

   Use only those VPN that protect you against those leaks.
     __________________________________________________________________

Using for streaming video (Netflix, Hulu, etc.)

   Our Top 10 VPN list includes the services tested for Netflix. Not all
   servers offered by these services work with Netflix, but there’s no
   provider that will guarantee you using Netflix via any server.

   Read further to know what VPN works with Netflix.

   The other streaming services tested by us are available as well. You
   can learn more from our VPN reviews.

   Besides, secure authorization methods also protect your personal data.
     __________________________________________________________________

Customer support

   Every service provides with customer support, but still, its level is
   different enough. There are various ways you can get customer support:
   by email, messengers, and 24/7 chat. All VPNs from our site have an
   excellent customer support with a high rating.
     __________________________________________________________________

‘’No-logging’’ policy

   Most of VPN providers claim that users’ logs aren’t kept. It’s
   impossible to prove or disprove it by testing.

   Our experts found credible confirmation of ‘’No-Logging’’ policy only
   at ExpressVPN, Private Internet Access and Perfect Privacy. The
   confirmation facts were taken from different independent mass media
   sources. You can read about criminal investigations that lead to VPN
   servers being arrested and inspected. It’s great if ‘’No-logging’’
   policy is proved.

   We recommend you to choose VPNs based out of “14 eyes”. Among them are
   ExpressVPN and NordVPN.
     __________________________________________________________________

Money-back guarantee

   It’s not only money refund when you aren’t pleased with a service but
   also the total refund in case you are pleased, and what’s more, with no
   questions asked.

   It’s a good way to try subscriptions at different VPN providers without
   spending money for those who want to test several services.
     __________________________________________________________________

Torrenting allowed

   Even there are VPNs from our top 10 that don’t support torrenting. In
   many countries torrents aren’t legal that’s why jurisdiction plays an
   important part. Carefully consider all cons and pros of the service you
   will choose. We always specify there whether torrenting is supported.
     __________________________________________________________________

Game consoles and other devices compatibility

   In 2019 many providers offer services for Xbox, PlayStation, Apple TV,
   etc. We tried to take into account these services when making the list
   of 10 best providers.

   If you get interested in it, read our reviews and find there the list
   of devices supported by the service.
     __________________________________________________________________

Jurisdiction

   The level of privacy depends on the jurisdiction of a VPN. If you want
   to get maximum privacy and ‘’No Logs’’ policy, choose VPNs located out
   of ‘’5 eyes’’ alliance (read more in the Wikipedia article), «14 eyes»
   and countries friendly to them.

   You’ll find the information about the jurisdiction in the overview of
   each service from the top list. Besides, P2P support often depends on
   the jurisdiction.
     __________________________________________________________________

Browser extensions

   Lots of users need VPN in browsers. For this, you can set up an
   extension compatible with your browser and manage a VPN connection from
   there. Extensions increase security in case your ISP supports IPv6
   (most of the largest Internet Service Providers are included).

   We didn’t take into account this feature when making our ‘’Top VPN
   services’’ list, but they do offer such software.
     __________________________________________________________________

Manage connection on a per-app basis

   What does this feature stand for? It’s an opportunity to configure the
   connection in a specific way (some programs bypass VPN, and the rest of
   them work via it).

   You may need it if you work in different browsers: using your real IP
   in one browser and a fake IP – in another one.

   This function is offered by ExpressVPN, for example.
     __________________________________________________________________

VPN server chaining

   The function lets you create a chain of VPN servers. Each element of
   the chain encrypts traffic and provides the highest level of anonymity
   even with the service that may keep logs.

   We’d like to prevent you from making a crime with VPN. Any technology
   won’t protect you from a serious investigation conducted by the police
   from several countries.
     __________________________________________________________________

Free Trial VPN

   This service is not offered as often as you could wish. Use our review
   "Best VPNs With Free Trial 2019" to find a service with a free trial
   period.

   We recommend CyberGhost from our Top 10.

   Besides, you can learn how Virtual Private Network works with a free
   VPN (read our ‘’Best 10 Free VPN Services 2019’’ review). But be
   careful! It has been reported that some free services sell users’
   personal information to third parties and distribute malicious software
   (read the article from HashedOut).
     __________________________________________________________________

Free VPNs aren’t included in the rating

   Our experts strongly recommend you to take seriously what David
   Balaban’s saying about VPN services:

   ‘’Have you ever thought of how much it costs to maintain hundreds of
   servers located in dozens of countries, a website, support specialists,
   and pay for traffic? You can’t control their ways of monetization and
   rely on them not selling your personal data to third parties. Though
   they could be useful to know about the principles of their work. I
   believe that nowadays even premium services, like ExpressVPN. are
   affordable for most of the internet users. And NordVPN, which is the
   best service in a ‘’budget’’ group, is almost free.’’

   Taking into account poor security and untransparent enough terms of
   service, free VPNs won’t be tested for our top list.

   Moreover, one can use the services for free during a free trial period
   or choose a traffic-limited package offered by many premium VPN
   providers.
     __________________________________________________________________

Why VPN?

   Security in the field of information technologies is getting higher.
   Modern computer and gadget systems have been more reliable and stable
   than they were 5-10 years ago. Still, the modern world is not limited
   to your hard drive or smartphone.

   The Internet is getting faster and more available, which results in
   increasing of the amount of data transferred. Lots of people prefer
   convenient cloud storage to keeping documents, photos, and video.

   VoIP services open new boundaries for communications with people from
   almost all over the world. Social networks, forums, online shops, etc,
   are the websites visited by you with the help of your personal
   information.

   Unfortunately, that growing data transfer is put at risk. For example,
   numerous Wi-Fi spots are ‘’ideal’’ for hackers to get access to your
   devices. Intercepting of logins, passwords, payment data may occur in
   such places.

   In most countries ISPs collect and keep information about users’ online
   activities: connection time, websites visited, and IP addresses.

   What’s more, there are sometimes virtual barriers created for the
   restriction of freedom and control.

   What’s the way out of this dilemma?

   Without any doubt, it’s a VPN technology, which is the most convenient
   and secure for people and companies.

   It encrypts traffic that goes through your ISP (today it’s impossible
   to decrypt the intercepted or stolen information which is protected in
   such a way) and hides the domains you visit on the Internet. The
   websites you visit can’t define your real geo-location. That sounds
   incredible, but it really works!

   Just have a look at the growing interest in Virtual Private Network
   over the past 5 years, which is seen from Google Trends:

   [] people and companies care about data protection

   As you can see from the screenshot above, more and more people and
   companies care about data protection. Because in the 21st century,
   which is called ‘’information age’’, it is obvious to do that.

   Use WhatsApp, Telegram, Skype, Viber, etc. Stream with Netflix, Hulu,
   HBO, Amazon Prime, etc. Care about your online safety. Do shopping
   online. Open new opportunities of the Internet.Enjoy doing this in any
   place with Virtual Private Network!
     __________________________________________________________________

Why not proxy/socks?

   Have you ever thought of them? Considering our readers’ reviews, many
   of them have already looked for proxy/socks lists and spent much time
   on constant connections, checks, and changes. The only reason is that
   proxy/socks taken from public usually don’t work, and their lists are
   often reposted from the same sources for the sake of advertising.

   What’s more, the sites you visit via incognito mode can easily define
   that you use a proxy. They often fail to protect against DNS leaks and
   never protect against IPv6 and WebRTC leaks. Moreover, it is much
   easier to use VPN!
     __________________________________________________________________

What do you need to start using VPN?

   Here are 4 easy steps available for all who can pay for the services on
   the Internet (you won’t have to reveal your personal data):
    1. Choose the service that fits your needs or a multifunctional one.
       The best multifunctional VPNs are in our Top 10.
    2. Choose a tariff plan. We always recommend you to take use of
       one-year subscription deals offered by most VPN providers. If you
       aren’t pleased, you’ll be able to refund the money if using a
       reliable VPN.
    3. Pay for the service. VPNs’ sites support most of the modern payment
       methods, including bitcoins.
    4. After the payment is confirmed, you’ll receive an email with
       everything you need to set up VPN software. You’ll easily set up
       Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS software and start using the
       service.

   We hope that the article was helpful in choosing your VPN. For this,
   we’ve compiled the most credible data out of hundreds of sources,
   conducted thousands of tests and personally tried all services.
