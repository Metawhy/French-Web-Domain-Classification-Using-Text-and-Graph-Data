Thank you

   Yep, it's been a while since January. I've been thinking about this
   blog a lot and I think it's a natural time to leave it be for a while.
   Life has had many changes since I started back in 2008 and it's been
   amazing to have a space to chronicle ideas, keep pictures and list
   books. But it's increasingly become harder to keep up with, and I don't
   want to see it as a chore.
   So I'm saying a heartfelt thank you to my readers (I think it's mainly
   my Mum!) and I may well pop in again in some time - I'll keep updating
   my book list.

Delicious room layout

   [Screen%2BShot%2B2015-04-26%2Bat%2B2.50.44%2BPM.png]
   Such a soothing room - the light and the muted colours are so peaceful
   to look at.

Gooold!

   [Screen%2BShot%2B2015-04-26%2Bat%2B2.54.14%2BPM.png]
   Well this changes things. GOLD Hasbeens. Of course they're not in my
   size, but if they fit you, just do this, please, for all of us.

Charlotte Love

   [Screen%2BShot%2B2015-04-26%2Bat%2B2.55.08%2BPM.png]
   Isn't this a gorgeous colour palette? The pink, white and black really
   jump out at me in an amazing way.

The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August

   [Screen%2BShot%2B2015-04-26%2Bat%2B2.56.39%2BPM.png]
   I haven't raved about a book on here for a while, but this was a
   particularly awesome read. Super clever plot, beautiful, aching writing
   and just an exceptionally clever idea. Loved it.

Klas Fahlen Letterpressed notebooks

   [Screen%2BShot%2B2014-11-26%2Bat%2B11.23.20%2BAM.png]
   Ooh hi pretties. Some lovely letterpressed notebooks coming out of
   Chronicle Books at the moment and I love the mid-century feel of these
   ones, especially.

Marimekko Räsymatto plate

   [Screen%2BShot%2B2015-04-26%2Bat%2B2.59.10%2BPM.png]
   I just want to extol the virtues of this plate. I have only one and not
   a whole set (yet!) but it's just so great. It's bigger than a normal
   side plate, but not a full dinner plate, and somehow just holds
   everything you need. It's also just a pattern I never tire of - I have
   been known to use it, clean it and use it immediately again, just
   because it's that good. I think it's time for the set...

Pens galore

   [Screen%2BShot%2B2015-04-26%2Bat%2B3.00.55%2BPM.png]
   I will never tire of sets of pens like these. Arranging and arranging
   in colour - just spectacular.

Geometric Foxy

   [Screen%2BShot%2B2015-04-26%2Bat%2B3.01.51%2BPM.png]
   I don't really wear brooches but isn't this one a sweetie? So
   geometric-y and foxy.

Oh sweet goodness

   [Screen%2BShot%2B2015-04-26%2Bat%2B3.02.45%2BPM.png]
   These boots are made for me. It's really all I can do to not dribble
   while looking at the screen.
