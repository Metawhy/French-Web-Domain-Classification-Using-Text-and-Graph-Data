   This workshop aims to bring together European academic and industrial
   actors in the field of air and water quality monitoring. These 2 days
   are dedicated to highlight the state of the art in miniaturized sensors
   (micro- and nanotechnologies) for pollutants detection in air and in
   water, and/or associated embedded microsystems, both in academic
   prototypes and commercial products. The existing field measurement
   campaigns (urban and rural sites) will also be addressed. Special
   emphasis will be put on improvements for addressing the issues that
   generate measurement errors (calibration, cross-sensitivity, aging,
   ...)

   Topics:
     * Improvement of sensitive materials
     * Gas micro-nanosensors
     * Chemical microsensors in liquid phase
     * Communicating embedded microsystems
     * Calibration and cross-sensitivities (selectivity)
     * Trends on low-cost sensors deployment
     * Field measurement campaigns and current standards


   Invited Speakers:
     * Eduard LLOBET (Full Professor, Univ. Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona,
       Spain): "2D nanomaterials beyond graphene: opportunities and
       challenges for selective gas sensing"

     * Laurent SPINELLE (Engineer R&D, INERIS Pôle CARA- Unit ASUR,
       France) : "Sensors and air quality :  an assessment of what can we
       expect today from low-cost sensors?"

     * Giorgio SBERVEGLIERI (Professor Emeritus, University of Brescia,
       Italy ; President of NANO SENSOR SYSTEMS SRL):"Nano MOX chemical
       sensors applied to agri-food field"

     * Jean-Christophe MIFSUD (President and founder of RUBIX SI,
       Toulouse, France): "Sensors selectivity versus sensors
       orthogonality : The human being as the ultimate example of sensors
       fusion"

     * Adrian ARFIRE (Metrology Engineer, AirParif, Paris, France): "A
       Holistic Approach to Low-Cost Air Quality Sensor Evaluation: The
       AIRLAB Microsensors Challenge"
