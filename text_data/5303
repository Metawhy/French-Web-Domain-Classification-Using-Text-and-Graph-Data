GENOMIC SEQUENCING

   Bryce Olson was diagnosed with aggressive stage 4 prostate cancer. When
   the standard of care didn’t work, Bryce turned to genomic sequencing
   which allowed his doctors to identify specific molecular drivers of his
   disease and identify specific treatments and clinical trials that were
   a better fit for his specific cancer.

   “The driver of my cancer was hidden in my DNA. I asked my doctors to
   ‘Sequence Me.’ The insights from genomic sequencing opened new doors
   and saved my life. Fight cancer differently with data.”

JOIN THE MOVEMENT

WEAR IT

   Wear it to your next doctor‘s appointment and start the conversation
   about getting the DNA of your cancer profiled. Get on the path to
   precision medicine. Go beyond the standard. Be your own best advocate
   and demand to be sequenced.

INDIVIDUALIZE YOUR CARE – DEMAND SEQUENCING

Q&A

   Read these frequently asked questions, download the battle card and
   build confidence to understand the science, open new doors, and
   overcome objections or pushback. Be empowered and get more personalized
   care.

Q. What do you mean by “Sequence Me?”

   ‘Sequence Me’ is a call to action and a new movement. All people
   suffering from cancer deserve new insights into what is driving their
   disease. To get that, we need to demand genomic sequencing from our
   medical teams in order to understand those molecular drivers that are
   hidden in the DNA of our tumors. The insights from genomic sequencing
   can open new doors for treatment and extend your life. At the very
   least, it will empower

   ...Read More
   you with more data and insights and help you understand your cancer
   better.

   In the future it is expected that many more doctors will eventually
   offer this and many more patients will get personalized diagnostics and
   medicine. Why? Because the advances and affordability in new solutions
   like this driven by science and technology innovation will make it
   embarrassing for healthcare providers to not offer it. But today is
   still early days. One great way to accelerate the adoption of new
   innovation is through greater education, awareness building, and
   forming community. Sequenceme.org is going to do that. We want to bring
   ‘strength in numbers’ to new innovation like this. We need to
   accelerate this and YOU have the power to demand it. The supply side
   that offers these services will respond when we as patients demand it.
   So let’s collectively wake up and demand “Sequence Me!”

Q. What is genomic sequencing?

   The genome is the complete set of genes or genetic material present in
   a cell or organism. The human genome is made up of 20,000 genes and
   more than 3 billion base pairs of the genetic letters known as DNA
   building blocks (A, T, C, Gs). A genome sequence is a specific order of
   those DNA building blocks (A, T, C, Gs) and ‘sequencing’ is a critical
   first step to understanding it and figuring out the order of those DNA
   nucleotides, or bases, in a genome—that make up who you are.

Q. What is genomic sequencing for cancer?

   Cancer is a genetic disease—that is, it is caused by changes in DNA
   that control the way cells function, especially how they grow and
   divide. These changes can be inherited, but most arise randomly during
   a person’s lifetime, either as a result of errors that occur as cells
   divide or from exposure to DNA-damaging carcinogens. These are referred
   to as “somatic” mutations or “acquired” mutations that are different
   from ‘germline’ or inherited changes.

   ...Read More

   Each person’s cancer has a unique combination of these genetic changes,
   and tumor DNA sequencing—sometimes called genetic profiling or genetic
   testing—is a test to identify these unique DNA changes.

   Knowledge of the genetic alterations in your cancer can help determine
   a treatment plan. Some treatments—particularly, some targeted
   therapies—are effective for people whose cancer cells have specific
   genetic alterations that cause the cells to grow out of control (these
   are sometimes called “driver” mutations).

   For example, mutations in the EGFR gene that make cells divide rapidly
   are found in some people’s lung cancer cells. A patient whose lung
   cancer cells harbor an EGFR mutation may respond to treatment with
   drugs called EGFR inhibitors. Clinical tumor DNA sequencing can reveal
   whether a patient’s lung tumor has an EGFR mutation.

   Tumor DNA sequencing is at the crux of precision medicine: care
   tailored to the molecular characteristics of each patient’s disease.

Q. Who is eligible to get “sequenced”?

   Anybody with cancer. For patients with hematologic malignancies (blood
   cancers) and soft tissue sarcomas, sequencing can be used early at
   diagnosis, for prognostication, and to guide overall clinical
   management. Folks with solid tumors (i.e. prostate, breast, lung,
   pancreatic, etc) become eligible when they have more advanced disease –
   and they should absolutely demand it when they become stage III/IV.
   Unfortunately, more than 60 percent of advanced cancer patients today
   receive no genomic testing — and are often relegated to highly toxic
   and ineffective therapies. Let’s change that!

Q. Who offers genomic sequencing / tumor DNA sequencing?

   Many academic cancer centers across the U.S. offer this and you just
   need to ask your medical oncologist for it. For example, Memorial Sloan
   Kettering in NYC offers the FDA approved MSK-IMPACT test. There are
   also many commercial diagnostic testing companies that offer amazingly
   informative tests, including Foundation Medicine, Ambry Genetics,
   Tempus, Perthera, and Caris Life Sciences among others. There are lots
   of options and your doctor may have a preferred provider for this, so
   just ask.

Q. Where do you get this done?

   Demand it first from your doctor. Your doctor will then likely
   coordinate with the pathology department to get a tumor sample from you
   (i.e through previous biopsy or surgically removed sample that is
   sitting preserved in a lab), or possibly through new blood draw. The
   doctor will then have those samples send over to one of the places
   above. They will also work with your health insurance provider on
   coverage / reimbursement for the diagnostic test.
