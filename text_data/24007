Photos of the Great Lakes State

Out of this world shot from Astronaut Christina Koch!

   Posted on May 4, 2019 by farlane

   On Wednesday, NASA astronaut & Grand Rapids native Christina
   Koch tweeted the photo above that perfectly captures Michigan’s
   Leelanau Peninsula with the caption “Waving to the mitten! Greetings to
   my friends and family in Michigan. The Great Lakes are as stunning from
   space as they are in person.”

   Indeed!! While Ms. Koch calls North Carolina home now, we appreciate
   her appreciation for the state she was born in. Even more appreciated
   is the work she’s doing in space & the contributions to science she’ll
   make as the new champion in the “longest single spaceflight by a woman”
   category. The Verge explains:

     Koch launched to the ISS on March 14th, along with NASA astronaut
     Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin. But rather than
     stay for six months, as most of NASA’s astronauts do, Koch is now
     slated to remain on the station through February 2020. That means
     she’ll spend 328 days, or nearly a full year, in orbit, which is one
     of the longest consecutive stays in space by any NASA astronaut.
     She’ll just miss beating Scott Kelly’s record of 340 straight days
     in orbit, the all-time record for a NASA astronaut. But she’ll beat
     Whitson’s time of 288 consecutive days in space … She’ll just miss
     beating Scott Kelly’s record of 340 straight days in orbit, the
     all-time record for a NASA astronaut. But she’ll beat Whitson’s time
     of 288 consecutive days in space.

     The lengthy stay could be helpful for NASA to better understand how
     long-duration spaceflight affects the human body. While Kelly was in
     space for his year-long mission, he gave samples of his own blood
     and did other health analyses so that NASA could see how his body
     changed while in orbit. The space agency then compared Kelly’s
     health data to that of his twin brother, former NASA astronaut Mark
     Kelly, who remained on Earth throughout the full year. The
     experiment revealed a few surprising ways that space messes with the
     body, like damaging DNA and affecting cognition. NASA noted that
     Koch’s flight will also add to this growing area of research.

   Read on for more at The Verge including plans for NASA’s first
   all-female space walk & DEFINITELY check out NASA’s photo gallery for
   Ms. Koch at work (wowzas) and/or all the photos from Expedition 59.

Wildfire in the Sky

   Posted on March 13, 2019 by farlane

   Sleeping Bear Bay Northern Lights, photo by Kenneth Snyder

   Here’s a feature via Leelanau.com…

   A Conflagration of Storms from his online book The 23rd Cycle, Dr. Sten
   Odenwald tells of the evening of March 13, 1989 when a massive wave of
   solar energy struck our atmosphere, creating one of the most impressive
   northern lights displays of the modern era.

     Alaskan and Scandinavian observers were treated to a spectacular
     auroral display that night. Intense colors from the rare Great
     Aurora painted the skies around the world in vivid shapes that moved
     like legendary dragons. Ghostly celestial armies battled from sunset
     to midnight. Newspapers that reported this event considered the
     aurora, itself, to be the most newsworthy aspect of the storm. Seen
     as far south as Florida and Cuba, the vast majority of people in the
     Northern Hemisphere had never seen such a spectacle. Some even
     worried that a nuclear first-strike might be in progress.

     Luke Pontin, a charter boat operator in the Florida Keys, described
     the colors in reddish hues as they reflected from the warm Caribbean
     waters. In Salt Lake City, Raymond Niesporek nearly lost his fish
     while starring transfixed at the northern display. He had no idea
     what it was until he returned home and heard about the rare aurora
     over Utah from the evening news. Although most of the Midwest was
     clouded over, in Austin Texas, Meteorologist Rich Knight at KXAN had
     to deal with hundreds of callers asking about what they were seeing.
     The first thing on many people’s mind was the Space Shuttle
     Discovery (STS29) which had been launched on March 13 at 9:57 AM.
     Had it exploded? Was it coming apart and raining down over the
     Earth? Millions marveled at the beautiful celestial spectacle, and
     solar physicists delighted in the new data it brought to them, but
     many more were not so happy about it.

     Silently, the storm had impacted the magnetic field of the Earth and
     caused a powerful jet stream of current to flow 1000 miles above the
     ground. Like a drunken serpent, its coils gyrated and swooped
     downwards in latitude, deep into North America. As midnight came and
     went, invisible electromagnetic forces were staging their own
     pitched battle in a vast arena bounded by the sky above and the
     rocky subterranean reaches of the Earth. A river of charged
     particles and electrons in the ionosphere flowed from west to east,
     inducing powerful electrical currents in the ground that surged into
     many natural nooks and crannies. There, beneath the surface, natural
     rock resistance murdered them quietly in the night. Nature has its
     own effective defenses for these currents, but human technology was
     not so fortunate on this particular night. The currents eventually
     found harbor in the electrical systems of Great Britain, the United
     States and Canada.

   Read on for much more about how our electrical grid can be brought to
   its knees by the power behind the beauty of the northern lights and get
   much more in the 23rd Cycle.

   Kenneth took this photo back in July of 2012. See more great pics in
   his Sleeping Bear Dunes album & also check out many more northern
   lights photos in the Leelanau.com group on Flickr!

2019’s Biggest Supermoon Flies Tonight!

   Posted on February 19, 2019 by farlane

   Super Moon Muskegon Michigan, photo by The Shutter Affair

   EarthSky, which by the way is a fantastic website for anyone who wants
   to get more out of the night sky that’s in great need of your support,
   has this to say about tonight’s supermoon, which will be the largest of
   2019:

     This year’s February presents the biggest full moon supermoon of
     2019. From around the world, the moon will look plenty full to the
     eye on both February 18 and February 19 as it parades across the
     nighttime sky. It reaches the crest of its full phase on February 19
     for much of the world. What’s a supermoon? It’s a popularized term
     for what astronomers call a perigean full moon. In other words, it’s
     a full moon near perigee, or closest to Earth for this month. This
     February 2019 full moon reaches its exact full phase closer to the
     time of perigee than any other full moon this year. Hence the year’s
     closest supermoon.

     Will you be able to discern with your eye that this full moon is
     larger than an ordinary full moon? Experienced observers say they
     can do it, but – for most of us – the difference is too small for
     the eye to notice.

     …here are other factors that make a supermoon special. For example,
     if you look outside tonight – assuming your sky is clear – you might
     be able to discern with your eye that the landscape is more brightly
     lit than usual by moonlight. Supermoons are substantially brighter
     than ordinary full moons.

     Also, the moon’s gravity affects earthly tides, and a supermoon –
     full moon closest to Earth – pulls harder on Earth’s oceans than an
     ordinary full moon. That’s why supermoons create higher-than usual
     tides, which tend to come a day or two after the full moon.

     By the way, that bright star accompanying the February supermoon is
     none other than Regulus, the brightest star in the constellation Leo
     the Lion.

Blue Ice at Bay City

   Posted on February 17, 2019February 17, 2019 by farlane

   Bay City Blue Ice, photo by Great Lakes Drone Works

   Great Lakes Drone Works captured some awesome shots from the ice on
   Saginaw Bay near Bay City. They write:

     We made our way out to Bay City State Park to capture some images of
     these huge chunks of ice. At first we were hoping drone photos would
     be the way to go but after walking around and getting up close, it
     was clear that ground photography was the better option.
     Blue ice occurs when weather conditions — such as a lack of high
     winds — allow water to freeze slowly and evenly, resulting in ice
     composed of large crystals (unlike snow, which is formed quickly and
     made up of small crystals).

     When light hits these big ice crystals, it can travel deep into the
     structures (compare this to snow, wherein light hits a sharp edge
     and reflects off of it right away, resulting in blinding white).
     When the light travels deeper into slowly formed ice, some of the
     red wavelengths of sunlight — which is the longest wavelength of
     visible light — get absorbed into the ice structure.

     The blue, which is the shortest wavelength of visible light, bounces
     back out, meet our eyes, and results in a deep aqua color.

   Head over to their Facebook for more shots and get lots more icy
   goodness at the ice tag on Michigan in Pictures!

The Colors of Cold

   Posted on January 30, 2019 by farlane

   Green Blue Ice, photo by Charles Bonham

   Apparently Charles is my go-to photographer for ice colors as his
   picture was used for my post about what makes ice blue or green a
   couple years ago on Michigan in Pictures. Then as now, I went to The
   Causes of Color to answer the question: What causes the blue color that
   sometimes appears in snow and ice?

     As with water, this color is caused by the absorption of both red
     and yellow light (leaving light at the blue end of the visible light
     spectrum). The absorption spectrum of ice is similar to that of
     water, except that hydrogen bonding causes all peaks to shift to
     lower energy – making the color greener. This effect is augmented by
     scattering within snow, which causes the light to travel an indirect
     path, providing more opportunity for absorption. From the surface,
     snow and ice present a uniformly white face. This is because almost
     all of the visible light striking the snow or ice surface is
     reflected back, without any preference for a single color within the
     visible spectrum.

     The situation is different for light that is not reflected, but
     penetrates or is transmitted into the snow. As this light travels
     into the snow or ice, the ice grains scatter a large amount of
     light. If the light is to travel over any distance it must survive
     many such scattering events. In other words, it must keep scattering
     and not be absorbed. We usually see the light coming back from the
     near surface layers (less than 1 cm) after it has been scattered or
     bounced off other snow grains only a few times, and it still appears
     white.

     In simplest of terms, think of the ice or snow layer as a filter. If
     it is only a centimeter thick, all the light makes it through; if it
     is a meter thick, mostly blue light makes it through. This is
     similar to the way coffee often appears light when poured, but much
     darker when it is in a cup.

   Click through for lots more about light & color!

   Charles took this photo last week on Sand Point near Munising. Check it
   out bigger and head over to his Flickr page for a bunch more great
   shots of winter in the Upper Peninsula!

Firing up the Polar Vortex Ice Cave Hype Machine

   Posted on January 28, 2019 by farlane

   Ice Cave Evening, photo by Mark Miller

   via leelanau.com who write:

   It’s a frosty 3 degrees in Leland with winds whipping powdery snow
   around and more single digits & high winds driving wind chills far
   below zero coming over the next couple of days. That’s not optimal for
   driving, and schools across the county are cancelled. It could,
   however, bring to life ice formations & caves on Leelanau’s western
   shore like we’ve seen several times in recent years.

   They’ve got past ice cave articles and will be posting updates right
   here! The Freep reports that Michigan is bracing for potentially
   record-breaking cold this week:

     A polar vortex is forecast to batter the Great Lakes and Midwest
     regions Tuesday through Thursday, with the lowest temperatures set
     to occur Wednesday. Some areas of Lower Michigan could face wind
     chills as low as 45 degrees below zero, according to the National
     Weather Service.

     That would mark the most bitter cold in years for the region.

     …The polar vortex is the large area of cold air and low pressure
     near each of the Earth’s poles. The air flows counter-clockwise near
     each of the poles, hence “vortex.”

     “Many times during winter in the northern hemisphere, the polar
     vortex will expand, sending cold air southward with the jet stream,”
     the NWS explains.

   Mark took this back in Mark of 2014. View the photo bigger and see more
   awesome shots in his Northern Michigan winters photo album.

Lunar Eclipse coming January 20th!

   Posted on January 19, 2019January 18, 2019 by farlane

   October 8, 2014 Lunar Eclipse, photo by David Marvin

   On Sunday night we have a chance to see the last total lunar eclipse
   until May 26, 2021! EarthSky shares information about viewing the lunar
   eclipse:

     On January 20-21, we’ll have the first full moon of 2019, and the
     first lunar eclipse of 2019 (and this is an eclipse-heavy year, with
     three solar and two lunar eclipses). It can be viewed from North and
     South America, Greenland, Iceland, Europe, northern and western
     Africa, plus the Arctic region of the globe. More details – and
     eclipse times for North America, plus links for those elsewhere –
     below.

     The eclipse will happen on the night of the year’s first of three
     straight full supermoons, meaning the moon will be nearly at its
     closest to Earth for this January, as the eclipse takes place.

     The January 20-21 total eclipse of the moon lasts for somewhat more
     than one hour. It’s preceded and followed by a partial umbral
     eclipse, each time persisting for over an hour. The whole umbral
     eclipse from start to finish has a duration of nearly 3 1/3 hours.

     Additionally, a penumbral lunar eclipse takes place before and after
     the umbral lunar eclipse. However, a penumbral lunar eclipse is so
     faint that many people won’t even notice it while it is happening.
     In our post, we only give the times of the moon passing through the
     Earth’s umbra – dark, cone-shaped shadow.

     The lunar disk often exhibits a coppery color during a total lunar
     eclipse. Although the moon is completely immersed in the Earth’s
     dark shadow, the Earth’s atmosphere refracts (or bends) sunlight and
     the longer wavelengths of light (red and orange) pass onward to fall
     on the moon’s face. The dispersed light from all of the world’s
     sunrises and sunsets softly illuminates the totally eclipsed moon.
     Actually, if you were on the moon, looking back on Earth, you’d see
     a total eclipse of the sun.

   They note that the partial umbral eclipse begins at (roughly) 10:34 PM
   with the total eclipse starting at 11:41 PM. The greatest eclipse is at
   12:12 AM with the total eclipse ending at 12:43 AM.

   David took this photo in October of 2014. Check it out background
   bigilicious on Flickr and head over to his Marvin’s Gardens blog for
   more pics from the eclipse & David!
