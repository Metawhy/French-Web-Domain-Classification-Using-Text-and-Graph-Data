     Capcom Japan Announce Another Resident Evil 7 Free-Roam VR Attraction

     Capcom Japan Announce Another Resident Evil 7 Free-Roam VR Attraction

   Harry Baker

   October 14, 2019

   Capcom announced a new walkthrough, free-roam VR attraction set in the
   world of Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, titled Biohazard: Walkthrough the
   Fear.

   Although the announcement was made in Japanese on Capcom’s Japan site,
   we’ve been able to glean a few basic details through translation
   services.

   The whole experience is available exclusively in Tokyo, Japan, at the
   Plaza Capcom Ikebukuro Store. The attraction is an original experience
   in the Resident Evil world, set in Louisiana. From a rough translation,
   it seems that players have been kidnapped by Jack Baker and trapped in
   the basement of his mansion. The experience will see you fight your way
   out of the mansion, presumably with lot of zombie-shooting action.

   It will cost 2800 Yen (roughly $25), with sessions lasting 40 minutes
   and requiring 4 people. You can book with 3 or less people, but the
   site does warn that you may be placed with other strangers who booked
   the same session, to make up the 4 people required. Sessions start from
   October 26, with reservations open online now.

   This is actually the second Resident Evil arcade VR experience
   announced recently – Biohazard Valiant Raid was opened at the same
   location in Tokyo back in July. Valiant Raid is still also available
   for reservations and, as far as we can tell from a rough translation of
   the booking site, will remain available in conjunction with Walkthrough
   the Fear.

   Sadly, there’s been no word at all on either experience opening up in
   any countries outside of Japan.

   Have you tried Valiant Raid or will you be checking out Walkthrough the
   Fear when it opens? Let us know in the comments below.

    Traffic Jams Lets You Live Out Your Intersection Management Dreams In VR

   Harry Baker

   October 14, 2019

   Have you ever looked at a traffic controller standing at a busy
   intersection and thought, “Man, I would really love to try that out
   without any of the stress or risk of managing cars in real life”?

   Well, have we got the game for you.

   IFRAME:
   https://www.youtube.com/embed/yloof-7JGrw?feature=oembed&showinfo=0&rel
   =0&modestbranding=1&iv_load_policy=3&playsinline=1&enablejsapi=1

   Traffic Jams is a new VR game from Little Chicken which will place you
   in the middle of an increasingly busy intersection, managing cars,
   buses, pedestrians and more. The art style is absolutely adorable and
   over-the-top, with little cartoon humans flying into the air and making
   increasingly frustrated Sims-like gibberish noises as everything starts
   to go haywire.

   traffic jams vr concept art traffic jams vr concept art

   If you want to keep up with the game, there’s a dedicated Traffic Jams
   subreddit, where the devs have been sharing some funny
   behind-the-scenes looks at development, test runs of the game’s
   mechanics and some cool concept art (pictured above).

   The developers have said that they’re aiming to launch on Oculus’
   platforms first, however they’re not fully committing to a Quest
   version just yet. They have said that despite aiming for the Oculus
   store initially, they do want the game “everywhere” and Quest is
   “definitely a platform [they’re] aiming for.” You can also see what
   appears to be a PlayStation Move controller at about 14 seconds into
   the teaser trailer, so a PSVR version might not be a far cry either.

   There’s no set release date or price just yet, but the developers have
   said they want the game out as soon as possible. Keep an eye out for
   any further news.

    Traffic Jams Lets You Live Out Your Intersection Management Dreams In VR

   Harry Baker

   October 14, 2019

   Have you ever looked at a traffic controller standing at a busy
   intersection and thought, “Man, I would really love to try that out
   without any of the stress or risk of managing cars in real life”?

   Well, have we got the game for you.

   Traffic Jams is a new VR game from Little Chicken which will place you
   in the middle of an increasingly busy intersection, managing cars,
   buses, pedestrians and more. The art style is absolutely adorable and
   over-the-top, with little cartoon humans flying into the air and making
   increasingly frustrated Sims-like gibberish noises as everything starts
   to go haywire.

   traffic jams vr concept art

   If you want to keep up with the game, there’s a dedicated Traffic Jams
   subreddit, where the devs have been sharing some funny
   behind-the-scenes looks at development, test runs of the game’s
   mechanics and some cool concept art (pictured above).

   The developers have said that they’re aiming to launch on Oculus’
   platforms first, however they’re not fully committing to a Quest
   version just yet. They have said that despite aiming for the Oculus
   store initially, they do want the game “everywhere” and Quest is
   “definitely a platform [they’re] aiming for.” You can also see what
   appears to be a PlayStation Move controller at about 14 seconds into
   the teaser trailer, so a PSVR version might not be a far cry either.

   There’s no set release date or price just yet, but the developers have
   said they want the game out as soon as possible. Keep an eye out for
   any further news.
