Coding Basics: What Kids Need to Start Coding

   October 7, 2019

   Are you interested in helping your kids learn to code? Are you
   overwhelmed trying to figure out what exactly they need to get started?
   Well here's the short answer to what kids need to start coding: almost
   nothing! Many people think you need to be some sort of genius, or
   really good at math before you can learn to code. Maybe that’s because
   it used to be that one’s first exposure to coding was in college, or if
   you were lucky, high school. The Keep Reading...

Hands On Pumpkin Seed Math with a Number Bond {FREE}

   September 23, 2019

   One of our favorite things to do as a family each fall is to head to a
   local farm and pick out pumpkins. Since fall is my favorite time of
   year, I get so excited to use the pumpkins to decorate our home along
   with some apple crisp scented hand soap from Target. But as much as I
   love picking out and setting out the pumpkins, I always have this
   nagging feeling that we need to do more than simply decorate with them.
   And this inevitably leads Keep Reading...

{FREE} Multiplication Four in a Row Game to Learn Facts

   September 2, 2019

   Normally over the summer, I'm really good about keeping my children
   involved in some type of learning activities. We may play math games,
   do computer work, or print off a few activities. This summer though, we
   were moving and many activities fell through the cracks. Well, we
   finally go moved, set a schoolroom, and life is back to normal...well
   as normal as life can be with four kids. But the beginning of this
   school year has been a little more Keep Reading...

{FREE} Editable Word Problem Templates: Help Kids Make Sense of Word Problems

   August 30, 2019

   One of the most common refrains I hear from parents and teachers is
   that their kids struggle most when faced with a word problem (or story
   problem). This is not surprising--a problem involving a single
   operation, with nothing to decipher or decision to make is
   straightforward. If the problem says to add, you add. If it is a long
   division expression, you divide. But a story that uses math to model
   the world around us takes computation to a whole Keep Reading...

Compare Decimals Cut & Paste Sort {FREE!}

   August 12, 2019

   Even before kids can count, their brains are able to distinguish
   between quantities (when the difference is significant). For example,
   if a toddler has a large pile of 15 blocks and you show him 2 blocks by
   comparison, he will know his pile is greater. As kids get older and
   develop more sophisticated visual spatial skills and counting skills,
   they are able to compare quantities in more complex situations. But
   learning to compare decimals adds a Keep Reading...
