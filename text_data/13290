zeotap Products and Services Privacy Policy

   zeotap GmbH (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is a data technology company that
   delivers innovative, device-centric and privacy-led data analytics and
   advertising solutions across industries.

   Our partners (“Data Partners”) are mobile network operators, mobile
   application providers, media and technology platform providers and
   others that have access to certain customer information (“User Data”)
   that they wish to monetize by using our services. Our services include
   data analytics and advertising services (“Services”). You can learn
   more about our Services on our website at www.zeotap.com.

   Our clients (“Clients”) are businesses, including brands and agencies
   (“Advertisers”), owners of media properties (“Publishers”), and other
   companies that send targeted advertising to mobile consumers. By using
   our Services, our Clients are able to address a particular audience and
   tailor advertisements to the likely interests and preferences of such
   audience.

   We work to ensure that our Services respect users’ privacy rights. To
   accomplish this goal, we adhere to privacy-by-design and
   privacy-by-default principles throughout the process of designing,
   building, and delivering our Services.

   We do not process information that directly identifies a particular
   individual such as an unencrypted name, address or government-issued ID
   number. However, whether or not User Data we receive are considered
   personal or personally-identifiable data depends on, among other
   factors, the definition that applies in a user’s physical location. For
   example, in some locations a user’s IP address may be deemed to be
   personal data, while in others it is not.

   By law, we are required to provide you with information regarding

   -how and on what legal basis we use and disclose your personal data;

   -how we take care for your privacy rights specific to your personal
   data;

   -how you can reach us in case you have any concerns regarding this
   privacy policy (“Policy”) or the way we are handling your data.

   The terms of this Policy apply to all User Data to the extent it
   contains your personal data as defined in the applicable laws and
   regulations.

   This Policy does not apply to information collected by our website
   www.zeotap.com. For our website privacy policy, go to the “zeotap.com
   Privacy Policy” section.

   This Policy also does not apply to information collected by our Data
   Partners or other third parties who may provide information to us, as
   their information handling practices are covered by their own privacy
   policies.

   This Policy may change from time to time, so please check back
   periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes in our
   processing of your Personal Data. If at any time in the future we plan
   to use Personal Data in a way that differs from this Policy, we will
   post Policy edits here and place notices on other pages of the Site as
   applicable, or by other means if required by law. You are responsible
   for ensuring that you are aware of the most recent version this Policy.
   This Policy was last modified on: July 3rd, 2018.

   The Policy’s wording can be technical; in case you have any questions,
   do not hesitate to write to [email protected].

   ePrivacy GmbH:

Data Categories we Receive and Use

   We receive the following categories of User Data from our Data
   Partners:

   -mobile advertising device IDs such as Apple’s Identifier For
   Advertisers (IDFA) and Google Advertising ID (“Advertising ID / Ad
   ID”);

   -cookie IDs;

   -hashed email addresses and hashed telephone numbers;

   -demographic information like age, gender, city/region, income,
   language and mobile contract data such as prepaid/postpaid
   (“Demographic Data”);

   -mobile app usage data about apps installed/accessed on a user’s device
   and app events and browsing data such as browsing URLs (“App Usage and
   Browsing Data”);

   -purchase data;

   -geolocation data.

   Our Data Partners may collect data directly from users (both online and
   offline) or receive data from third parties.

   We request that our Data Partners provide users with all required
   information about the use of their data and provide an opt in / opt out
   option according to applicable laws and regulations.

   We may also use cookies, pixels and similar tools to collect users’
   Advertising IDs or cookies’ identifiers ourselves. These tools also
   automatically collect and send us information such as referral URLs
   (Uniform Resource Locators), user agent string, and IP addresses. This
   information is a normal part of the log file information that is
   routinely exchanged as part of communication between operating systems.
   As part of the existing programmatic technology for the delivery and
   display of advertisements on mobile devices, we also receive
   Advertising Bid Requests.

   When we obtain different User Data pertaining to the same device from
   multiple Data Partners, we aggregate such User Data and store it
   against the same Advertising ID (“Ad IDs”) or cookie. zeotap also
   maintains a separate ID inventory, which connects the User Data into a
   common ID (“zeoID”) and is an internal pseudonymous identifier.

   We enhance User Data to create de-identified data segments and
   aggregate such segments into segment lists or Ad ID / cookie lists
   based on our Clients’ preferences. We then share such lists with our
   Clients to enable them to effectively target the relevant users.

   We do not interact directly with users or their devices, unless a user
   sends us a deletion request along with their Ad ID, as described below
   under “Choice and Control Rights you Have”.

   Below we describe the User Data categories in more detail.

Advertising IDs

   Advertising IDs (“Ad IDs”) are user-resettable, unique, anonymized
   identifiers for advertising. Ad IDs identify a specific device and are
   implemented both on Apple iOS (“Identifier for Advertising” / “IDFA”)
   and Google Android (“Advertising ID”).

   We obtain Ad IDs associated with de-identified User Data from our Data
   Partners. Ad IDs are then used by our Clients to identify advertising
   requests and to deliver relevant advertisements.

   We may also use Ad IDs to establish a relationship between different
   User Data attributes pertaining to the same user. For example, if we
   obtain User Data that indicates a certain user is between 25 and 30
   years old, and later learn from another Data Partner that the user of
   the same device is interested in a healthy lifestyle, we combine this
   information against the same Advertising ID (“Ad IDs”) or cookie.

Cookies

   An HTTP cookie (also called web cookie, Internet cookie, browser cookie
   or simply a cookie) is a small piece of data sent from a website and is
   stored in the user’s web browser while the user is browsing.

   We set third party cookies on behalf of Publishers who provide space
   for the display of advertising within websites.

   We may use cookies to establish a relationship between devices or data
   pertaining to the same user. If we already have information about a
   device’s user, we may link the information stored in cookies to the
   device’s Ad ID. We call this activity of linking information
   “mapping.”

   We use this information to facilitate the delivery of our Clients’
   targeted Ads.

Log File Information

   In the course of the mapping activity described in the above paragraph,
   we receive such information as referral URLs (Uniform Resource
   Locators), user agent string, and IP addresses.

   When you come to the website where zeotap cookies are set, the log file
   we automatically receive includes the referral URL, which is the
   address of the website that you came from. We do not use and discard
   referral URLs within reasonable time in compliance with our data
   retention period.

   We use IP addresses to derive information such as country and carrier.
   Afterwards, we discard IP addresses within reasonable time in
   compliance with our data retention period.

   We use user agent string information contained in the log file to
   determine your device operating system and device model. Afterwards, we
   discard user agent string within reasonable time in compliance with our
   data retention period.

Hashed Email Addresses and Hashed Phone Numbers

   Some Data Partners or Clients may provide their offline data such as
   hashed email addresses and hashed phone numbers. We require that such
   data are hashed using secure hashing algorithms prior to sharing with
   zeotap.

   We use hashed emails or hashed phone numbers to establish a
   relationship between offline and online user profiles pertaining to a
   certain user. For example, our Client would like to run an advertising
   campaign on mobile devices targeting users whose hashed email addresses
   and / or hashed phone numbers the Client already has. However, without
   respective Ad IDs the Client cannot target the desired audience. By
   comparing hashed email addresses and hashed phone numbers provided by
   the Client with the User Data we have from our Data Partners, we can
   match hashed email addresses or hashed phone numbers to Ad IDs
   corresponding to the same user. As a result, we have a list of Ad IDs
   corresponding to the list of users the Client would like to target.

Demographic Data

   We may obtain demographic User Data from our Data Partners, such as:

   -user demographics (e.g., age or age range and gender);

   -general geographic area of the billing address and zip code;

   -predicted or actual income tier;

   -other demographic information that was received or collected by our
   Data Partners.

   zeotap uses this information to create demographic segments about
   users, for example users who are “males, 30 to 34, living in Brooklyn.”
   We connect segments with Ad IDs so that our Clients can reach their
   target audiences on mobile devices.

App Usage and Browsing Data

   We may obtain App Usage and Browsing Data from our Data Partners, such
   as:

   -apps installed/accessed on a user’s device;

   -app events such as purchases or sign-ups;

   -browsing data such as Uniform Resource Locators (“URL”s).

   URLs are web addresses, a specific character string that constitutes a
   reference to a resource. Most web browsers display the URL of a web
   page above the page in an address bar.

   We transform App Usage and Browsing Data into aggregated segments based
   on interests or purchase intent (such as Sports Enthusiast, Health &
   Fitness Buffs) which are of interest for our Clients.

Purchase Data

   We may obtain purchase data from our Data Partners, such as:

   -items you have bought in stores;

   -items you have bought online;

   -items you have put in a shopping basket online.

Geolocation Data

   We may receive data from Data Partners about the physical location of a
   specific device, including latitude-longitude coordinates obtained
   through GPS tools, Wi-Fi or cell tower triangulation techniques.

   The location data we receive from Data Partners may be generalized,
   non-precise location data, or we may render the location data
   non-precise, in order to provide generalized location data to our
   Clients. Our Clients may use inferences from this information to send
   localized Ads or targeted Ads.

Advertising Bid Requests

   In real-time bidding (“RTB”), Publishers send advertising bid requests
   (“Bid Requests”) in real-time to Advertisers, indicating that they have
   an open advertising space (“Impression”) to sell. The Impression is
   auctioned among interested Advertisers and sold to the highest bidder.

   Bid Requests from mobile apps usually contain an Ad ID alongside
   information such as the IP address, type of the Impression (banner,
   audio, video), format, app, publisher, device, etc. We collect and use
   the Bid Request and Ad ID in order to participate in the RTB process on
   behalf of our Clients.

   We render IP-addresses we receive as part of the Bid Requests imprecise
   to prevent the identification of a user. However, we may store and
   process information derived from that IP address (information country
   and the telecom operator you are using). We delete IP addresses after
   we no longer need them to extract this kind of information.

   Our Clients may then use de-identified IP addresses to localize Ads.

Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data

   Our Services enable our Clients to tailor advertising you see on your
   mobile device to your interests and preferences. As a result, the
   number of ads that are not relevant or of interest to you will be
   reduced. To achieve this goal, we need to process your personal data.

   The legitimate interest of facilitating targeted online marketing in
   combination with creating customized audience segments based on unified
   customer profiles is our basis for the processing of your data (art.
   6(1)(f) GDPR). Our legitimate interest lies in conducting and managing
   our business. We consider and balance any potential (positive and
   negative) impact on you and your rights before we process your personal
   data for our legitimate interests to make sure that our interests are
   compelling enough. We will not use your personal data for activities
   where our interests will be overridden by the impact on you. We
   conducted and documented an internal legitimate interest assessment
   that determined: (i) our legitimate interests, (ii) that the processing
   is necessary for our legitimate interests; and (iii) that your
   interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. You
   can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate
   interests against any potential impact on you by contacting us at
   [email protected]

   Our Data Partners or other third parties who provide User Data to us
   may use another basis; such as consent to process your personal data
   and share it with us according their respective privacy policies.

   Any processing of your personal data by zeotap is subject to your
   rights of choice and control as explained below.

   zeotap is dedicated to the highest standards of privacy and is a member
   of IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau).

   For the purpose of enabling to share User Data with Oracle and its
   customers and partners to use such data for the purpose of
   personalization and linkage in order to market products and services to
   you (please refer to Oracle’s privacy policy available
   at: https://www.oracle.com/uk/legal/privacy/marketing-cloud-
   data-cloud-privacy-policy.html.), we rely on your consent. Your consent
   is obtained on behalf of Oracle and its customers and partners by our
   third party data providers.

   Management Platforms (DMPs), advertising marketplaces, ad networks etc.
   (“Data Platform”);

   -ad measurement companies;

   -our hosting provider Amazon Web Services.

   Advertisers and Publishers do not receive access to Ad IDs, Cookies,
   hashed email addresses or hashed phone numbers. They may only see the
   list of segments created on the basis of User Data that serve as
   targeting criteria.

   Data Platforms only receive access to segment names and respective Ad
   IDs or Cookies. They are never granted access to hashed email addresses
   or hashed phone numbers.

   We only share hashed email addresses and hashed phone numbers with
   Advertisers that wish to match their offline users’ data to Ad IDs or
   Cookies to be able to target their customers on mobile devices. Data is
   not shared on a device-specific level, but shared as a list.

   Ad measurement companies we work with include Nielsen Company (US) LLC.

   Furthermore, we may share your User Data with third party vendors that
   help us extract valuable insights from raw User Data. For example, if
   zeotap receives raw app ID like 123456, this information in itself is
   not useful. Therefore, we use a third party engine to convert the
   numerical ID to the actual app name (e.g. “Gardening Advice App”) which
   can be used for the purposes of targeted advertising. Similar engines
   are used for making sense out of Browsing Data. In all of these
   processes, only the App Usage and Browsing Data are sent to external
   vendors who send us back the processed output. No identifiers such as
   Ad IDs, cookies, hashed email addresses or hashed phone numbers are
   shared with third-party vendors.

   We store User Data in data centers provided by third parties.

   We also share your User Data information with our affiliates in the USA
   and India that provide technical support and help zeotap operationally
   perform the services.

   We will also disclose your User Data in response to valid legal
   processes, for example, in response to a court order, a subpoena or
   other legal request for information, and/or to comply with applicable
   legal and regulatory reporting requirements. We also may disclose your
   information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent,
   or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud,
   situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any
   person, or to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing
   our products and/or services and with applicable laws, or as otherwise
   required or permitted by law or consistent with legal requirements. We
   are required to disclose Personal Information in response to lawful
   requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or
   law enforcement requirements.

   In addition, we may transfer your information to an entity or
   individual that acquires, buys, or merges with us, or our affiliates.
   In these cases, we will require the acquiring company to carry on the
   material terms of this Policy, including the requests for account
   deletion.

When we Transfer User Data Internationally

   When we share User Data with the recipients described above, such
   sharing may constitute a transfer outside of your home location. By
   law, we are required to ensure that the level of protection guaranteed
   for your personal data by the European laws is not undermined by such
   transfer. Some recipients of data may be participants of programs like
   the Privacy Shield which enables them to ensure the appropriate level
   of protection. In other cases we enter the EU Standard Contractual
   Clauses with respective User Data recipients.

How We Protect Personal Data

   We take appropriate technical and organizational safeguards to protect
   any personal data we receive from theft, loss, and unauthorized access.
   We follow generally accepted standards to protect personal User Data
   throughout the entire use cycle starting from the initial transfer
   until deletion.

   However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
   electronic storage, is 100% secure.

   We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal
   data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a
   breach where we are legally required to do so.

Your Rights with Respect to your Personal Data (INCLUDING OPT-OUT OPTIONS)

   Your personal data belongs to you. You have the following rights with
   respect to your personal data:

   -right to request confirmation as to where or not we process any of
   your data, and, where that is the case, right of access to your data;

   -right to request rectification of inaccurate personal data;

   -right to request erasure of your personal data;

   -right to restrict processing of your personal data if certain
   conditions are met, e.g., if you believe the personal data we hold
   about you is not accurate;

   -right to object to us processing your personal data;

   -right to data portability, which only applies, however, if you
   provided us your personal data directly.

   The options to exercise these rights are described below.

OPT-OUT OPTIONS

   -To opt-out from the processing or exercise your other rights with
   respect to your personal data, you can directly contact your mobile
   operator or another Data Partner with whom you shared your personal
   data (please refer to their respective privacy policy). It is the
   responsibility of the respective Data Partner to ensure that your
   request is honored in full.

   -To find out whether we process any of your personal data stored
   against a zeotap Cookie, access it or make us erase it, you can use our
   user rights portal accessible via https://privacy.zeotap.com. In
   addition, we offer an app for iOS and Android (Data Protection Rights
   App) that allow to check whether we process any of your personal data
   stored against your advertising ID with the same functionalities.

   -To opt-out from targeted advertising, you may select  “Limit Ad
   Tracking” on iOS or “ “Opt-out of interest-based ads”” on Google
   Android. In this case, we will keep your User Data until you request us
   to delete it, but we will not use it for targeted advertising purposes,
   and activity on your mobile device will be effectively invisible to us.
   You may reset the Ad ID by selecting the option “Reset Advertising
   Identifier” on Apple iOS or “Reset Advertising ID” on Google Android.
   This will delete your current Ad ID from your device and replace it
   with a new Ad ID. As a result, we will not receive any Bid Requests
   containing the old Ad ID anymore. After a certain amount of time we
   will delete the old Ad IDs and related User Data. However, we may
   receive access to your new Ad ID and match it with other User Data we
   might receive from our Data Partners over time.

   -To opt-out of targeted advertising within your mobile browser, you can
   clear or block our cookies in the settings of your mobile browser. In
   this case, we will keep your data, but we will not be able to use it to
   target your device when you are browsing mobile websites. However,
   regardless of the deletion of cookies, your device can still be
   targeted when you are using apps on the basis of your Ad ID.

   -To opt-out of some – but not all – targeted advertising you may also
   visit the webpage http://youradchoices.com/appchoices and/or download
   the mobile AppChoices app. For more information about targeted
   advertising and opt-out options, you may visit for example the webpage
   of Network Advertising Initiative’s at
   http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices and/or Your Online Choices at
   www.youronlinechoices.com/uk.

   -To make us erase your personal data associated with your Ad ID from
   our system, you can submit   your Ad ID to our Privacy Team at
   [email protected] We will delete all User Data associated with the
   submitted Ad ID. This will delete all related data and prevent any
   future collection and use of data associated with the Ad ID. If we did
   not have your Ad ID, but had some other data such as cookies, hashed
   email addresses or hashed phone numbers, we will keep this data unless
   our Data Partner informs us that these have to be deleted.

   -To make us rectify your personal data in our system, restrict its
   processing or in connection with other requests you might have, please
   contact our Privacy Team at [email protected]. Do not forget to submit
   your Ad ID together with your request so that we can assist you
   effectively.

   Apart from all the above rights, you can also lodge a complaint with a
   supervisory authority if you believe we our Data Partners infringed
   upon your rights.

   Please also note that using the above options does not mean you will
   block mobile advertising but it means that the ads you receive will not
   be personalized for you.

Information Retention

   We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to
   fulfil the purposes we collected it for.

   We retain data until the occurrence of the following events:

   -request from a Data Partner to delete certain User Data; or

   -the user submits his Ad ID to us for deletion of associated data; or

   -expiration of the zeotap defined retention period with a deletion of
   unused profiles after 3 months.

Children’s Privacy

   We do not knowingly collect, use, or share:

   -Data about users under the age of sixteen (16); and

   -Data about past or current activity on applications directed at
   children under the age of sixteen (16).

Your California Privacy Rights; California Does Not Track Disclosures

   If you are a resident of California, USA resident, California Civil
   Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding the
   disclosure of your PII (as defined by California law) by zeotap or its
   subsidiaries to a third party for the third party’s direct marketing
   purposes. You may request this information in writing using the
   information under “Contact Us” below.

   Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to
   signal to operators of websites and web applications and services
   (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such
   operators to track certain online activities, over time and across
   different websites. We do not honor “Do Not Track” signals.

Target: Food Delivery App Users

   Prefer wings with your meal on a hard work day? We helped Red Bull
   target its "[email protected]" campaign encouraging professionals to
   accompany their lunch with energy drinks, to combat the stress of urban
   life. The campaign was powered by our custom interest segment comprised
   of active food delivery app users had previously installed and used on
   their devices.

We drive results. People drive Mercedes.

Target: Men, 40+, High Income

   The new Mercedes E-class is not a car everyone can afford. We created a
   custom segment tailored to Mercedes' desired audience that increased
   both awareness and consideration significantly compared to all
   campaigns run in parallel.

Tailoring Pepe Jeans' perfect audience

   100% Audience Discovery

Pepe Jeans

   Before launching their new autumn/winter collection, Pepe Jeans assumed
   its campaign would resonate most with a younger audience. Running a
   deterministic audience discovery with zeotap revealed the campaign was
   in fact best received by the much older Gen X. The distribution
   strategy was shifted and Pepe Jeans could allocate all their budgets
   where they made the most impact.
