State of the Map

   State of the Map is the annual event for all mappers and OpenStreetMap
   users. The three day event in Heidelberg hosts talks, discussions and
   workshops all around the free and open map of the world.

Our motto: Bridging the Map

   Right next to the old bridge in Heidelberg there lives a curious little
   statue – a bronze monkey. In its hand, it holds a mirror to remind
   anyone crossing the bridge to look back from where they came from and
   remember who they are. For the 2019 SotM in Heidelberg we want to take
   the role of that little monkey and remind everyone that no matter where
   we are going and what we are doing with OSM, we should never forget
   that we all come from the same origin: a little map that anyone can
   modify and use. Whether you are a hobby mapper, a scientific
   researcher, a humanitarian, an NGO, a government agency, a small
   business or a global company — we want to bridge the gap between us, or
   better yet, we want to Bridge the Map.
