   Compatibility View is an Internet Explorer feature that helps users
   view websites designed for previous versions of the browser. (Your
   network administrator likely set this feature on by default if your
   role involves working with legacy database tools from SAP, Oracle, or
   other third party providers.) However, enabling Compatibility View can
   cause problems for more modern sites, like this one. You will
   significantly improve your experience by disabling this feature from
   your browser’s settings. To see this site properly, click the
   "Settings" gear in the upper right corner of your browser window and
   select "Compatibility View Settings." Then, remove comcast.com from the
   "Websites You've Added" list and uncheck the "Display Intranet Sites"
   box. This site should automatically reload for you when you click
   "Close."
