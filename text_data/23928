   UPDATE:  Several quilts have sold and I've indicated it on the above
   photos. Thank you! I will keep updating the photos as more are sold.
   It's time for a quilt sale. Why? Because we've got lots of quilts. And
   because it allows me to buy more fabric to  . . . well, you know . . .
   to make more quilts!  Plus, full transparency here, college is
   expensive and selling these quilts would help with that.
   Every quilt is handmade by me. 100% cotton. Machine wash and machine
   tumble dry. Prices and quilt measurements are indicated in each photo
   above. Shipping will be whatever the actual shipping cost is to send it
   to you.
   Interested in one in particular?  Send me an email (click the envelop
   icon in the upper right hand side bar) and I can answer any questions
   you have.
   Let me know which one you want. We will figure out shipping together
   and I'll send you a PayPal invoice. Once paid, I'll wrap and box it up
   and send it on it's happy way to you. Sound good?
   Fingers crossed you find something you love.
   And thank you from the bottom of my heart.

   P.S. I plan to post this on my Old Red Barn Co. Facebook page and would
   love any re-shares you might consider. I'm trying to figure out an
   effective way to succinctly post it on Instagram too. :)

Back to it

   [2.jpg]
   Here it is the end of summer where I find myself like I have every year
   for the last 16 years. The girls go back to school and I deep clean and
   organize a few things that were put on hold during the summer months. I
   eventually sit down in the over sized office chair, spin it around to
   sit squarely in front of the computer, and then stare at the screen for
   a few days.  Wanting to encapsulate the last few months into words, I
   sit here and surf the Internet instead. And play a billion games of
   solitaire.
   [3.jpg]
   One daughter returned to college. The other entered her senior year of
   high school. First apartments. College tours. Passports obtained.
   Quilts made. Coaches met. Trails hiked. Lakes paddled. Cars repaired.
   Gardens harvested. And many hours sitting in the living room waiting
   for one or both to arrive home in the dark stillness of night.
   [4.jpg]
   The above quilt is from a pattern called "Stripe Me Lucky" by Michelle
   McKillop for Jen Kingwell Designs.  It is one of my favorite quilts
   I've ever made. It's scrappy and you know how I love a scrappy quilt.
   And that zig zag border is just so cute. I collected dozens of 100%
   cotton striped shirts from thrift stores for this quilt in order to
   have a variety of striped fabrics. Honestly, that has changed they way
   I think about buying fabric.  I've got a keen eye at the thrift store
   now looking at clothing as possible quilt fabric.  This winter I'd like
   to amass a good variety of corduroy and try something new. We shall
   see.
   [5.jpg]
   I also made this solid 2x4 quilt (it's a free tutorial from Film in the
   Fridge and this is the third one I've made.) That new apartment needed
   a new quilt and my daughter wanted it to coordinate with the quilt I
   made her for her dorm freshman year. She picked the fabric and helped
   pair them up for each block. She also kept me company and opened safety
   pins for me while I basted it. Love is stitched into each and every
   seam.

   [IMG_20190703_183408_062.jpg]
   [IMG_20190705_130803_158.jpg]
   I also made this quilt after seeing @jaceynotjc on Instagram making
   similar blocks. I loved, loved, loved making those blocks and can
   totally see myself making more in the future. The color palette was a
   fun departure for me. I used brown in each block and didn't use any
   red. The end result feels very vintage to me.
   That's summer. In a nutshell. With so many of the delicious details
   brushed aside that make summer special. Like the music of the crickets
   floating through the windows. The fireworks exploding over the sunset
   lake. A crowd of people eating popsicles to remember Papa. And the
   notes left on my bathroom mirror telling me thank you for this and
   that.
   Fall is my favorite. But summer is pretty alright too.

Stray cats that become stay cats

   [Sweetie%2BBoy.jpg]
   [Bomber.jpg]
   [Brownie.jpg]
   Over the years, several stray cats have stopped at our house. Dogs too,
   for that matter. The guy in the top, Sweetie Boy, showed up about 14
   years ago as a 4 month old kitten. You don't earn a name like Sweetie
   Boy unless . . . unless . . . well, unless you're sweet. And he is. He
   has been the proud hunter of more mice that I can count, let mean,
   wandering tom cats know to keep on trucking and graciously welcomed new
   pets to the circle over the years.
   The other two showed up earlier this year and have quickly wiggled
   their way into the family. Bomber, the black one, is young. Still a
   kitten for sure. He's one of the coolest cats I've ever known. He could
   be hundreds of yards away when he spots me step outside and he comes
   running and drive bombs right into me. Hence the name Bomber.  He also
   really likes to hide in the bushes and jump out and scare me. As
   absolutely as often as possible. He's especially fond of my husband.
   They all are actually. Probably because he stops and pets them every
   single time, no mater what.
   Then there is Brownie. She is timid. So soft. And now that she knows
   us, she is loyal and sweet. WE really like having her and her scratchy
   little meow around.
   Outdoor, stray cats that become stay cats are pretty cool.

Sharing what I will

   Earlier this year, my blog turned 11 years old. Back in the day, I
   would post thoughts and photos on motherhood. But my beautiful
   daughters reached an age where it just didn't feel right to share them
   so freely here. I still have big thoughts about motherhood and what my
   role/responsibility/meaning/am I doing it right/future looks like, but
   they just don't get top billing around here anymore.
   Like, prom was a few weeks ago.
   But spring here is beautiful. And it's comfortable to share images of
   that.

Father's Choice quilt

   [1.jpg]
   [2.jpg]
   [3.jpg]
   My latest finish. The individual block is historically called Father's
   Choice. Bright happy colors in an over sized block. An excellent quilt
   holder that knows to keep her feet hidden. And a stray outdoor cat that
   has decided to call our house home.

   P.S. If you want more details about this quilt and progress photos of
   it along the way, search the hashtag #danasfatherschoicequilt on

Spending my days

   [1.jpg]
   The past weeks have been busy. One has been home from college for
   spring break. The other had spring break the week before that. I've
   taken on a bit more work from home and that always comes with loads of
   hours of learning curve. I've been out in the greenhouse putting tiny
   seeds into tiny little pots of dirt and checking them incessantly for
   signs of germination. And in a mad frenzy of weed pulling, I tweaked my
   shoulder. Or that could have been from making the bed. It's hard to say
   really what did it but it's prevented me from sewing.
   [2.jpg]
   In between all the busy, however, I have pulled lots of blue fabrics.
   I've wanted to revisit the Wyoming Valley quilt block and thought I
   would do so with a scrappy mix of blue and white fabrics. I made a
   sampler quilt a few years ago  and one of my favorites in that quilt is
   the Wyoming Valley block. You can see some of the blues in the photo
   above. That is if you can look past the beginning pile of what has
   become my stripe fabric obsession.
   [3.jpg]
   I've been wanting to make the Stripe Me Lucky quilt and realized that I
   needed a massive variety of striped fabric in order to do the pattern
   justice. So, one day at the thrift store, I wondered over to the men's
   button up shirt section and found several 100% cotton shirts. That has
   led me to visiting every thrift shop in the tri-state area and beyond.
   The men's button up shirt section is a gold mine! What amazing finds to
   be found! I mean, look at all those stripes.
   Wonder when I'll get to do something with them. . .

Scrappy quilts for the win!

   [4.jpg]
   You don't need me to tell you of my deep love for scrappy quilts.
   Broken record on repeat. Interestingly enough, I just searched my own
   blog with the term "scrappy quilt" and the first thing to pop up was a
   post from about this time last year with photos of a quilt I made with
   this exact quilt block proclaiming my love of  . . . wait for it . .
   .SCRAPPY QUILTS!
   To quote myself (ha!!!):     I love a billion different fabrics and
   colors together in one quilt. I love making the riot of color come
   together. This quilt has me fired up and committed to making ALL THE
   SCRAPPY QUILTS!  All scrappy, all the time!   (all caps, jazz hands and
   bug eyes too!!)
   I'm nothing if not predictable.
