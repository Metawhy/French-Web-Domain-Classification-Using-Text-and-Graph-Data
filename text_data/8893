Xpenology: The Definitive Guide (2019 Update)


   Xpenology Overview

   More than likely you’ve been digging around on the internet looking for
   ways to build your own network-attached storage server and are looking
   for a solid and flexible OS to use on it. Which then lead you to the
   big question:

What is Xpenology?

   Xpenology is a bootloader for Synology’s operating system which is
   called DSM (Disk Station Manager) and is what they use on their NAS
   devices. DSM is running on a custom Linux version developed by
   Synology. Its optimized for running on a NAS server with all of the
   features you often need in a NAS device.

   Xpenology creates the possibility to run the Synology DSM on any x86
   device like any pc or self-built NAS. So you can benefit from the
   powerful multimedia- and cloud-features of DSM without buying the
   hardware NAS from Synology. A lot of people prefer this because they
   can pick out there own (more powerful) processor and RAM to handle
   things like transcoding video.

   This will also save money and make you more flexible in the long term.

   It’s also possible to natively install and run apps on DSM using their
   package manager. Think of the package manager like its own app store
   where you can download (and manage the update process) of each
   application. This includes some useful tools and packages like git,
   other version-control systems, cms like WordPress, LDAP-servers, your
   own mail server, the popular “Docker” and even a surveillance
   application where you can control and manage IP cameras in your home or
   business.

   I think this is an important thing because Synology offers really great
   support. They’re smart using Linux and would fix strange bugs remote
   over ssh. You should decide if its worth from you to buy a stock-NAS to
   benefit from them.

   Especially for end-users which less or none experience in IT/Linux, it
   would be a better deal for them to buy a Synology NAS, switch it on and
   have fun without caring about the backend technology.

Where Can I download Xpenology?

   Downloading Xpenology is pretty easy and once downloaded, you can
   install in about 15-20 minutes. If you are doing a fresh install of DSM
   6.1 then carry on with the tutorial and omit references to DSM 5.2. i
   fyou are upgrading then these are the same instructions to use to get
   started.

How Do I Install Xpenology?

   There are a few things you need to get this up and running the first
   thing is, of course, a computer, the next thing you need is a USB
   stick. I just use an old one I had laying around here and it will do
   the trick! So if you have that and a little bit of spare time you can
   get this up and running pretty quickly.

   If you’re doing an upgrade make sure you have a backup of your data
   before moving forward, you will be glad you did if anything turns
   south!

   Hardware for Xpenology

What Are The Hardware Requirements?

   First is the hardware I used for my build (check prices below):
     * Fractal Design Node 304
     * ASUS H87I-PLUS Motherboard
     * 2 x WD Red 2TB NAS Hard Drive  & (1) 4TB WD Red NAS Hard Drive
     * Seasonic 360W 80PLUS Gold
     * Crucial Ballistix Sport 8GB Kit (2 x 4GB)
     * Intel I5-4440 Processor

   Now the above hardware is only what I ended up using because it fit my
   specific needs. When it comes down to it you can install xpenology on
   almost any PC you might have laying around. A lot of people are also
   using the HP Microservers like the HP n40l and the newer HP ProLiant
   N54L, they are a great fit for a basic install with plenty of people in
   the community sharing the same setup. So if you run into a snag or have
   questions about your options, chances are there are some people that
   can help.

   Here is a short list of some hardware which has been confirmed to work
   with Xpenology and some that we know will not.

   Known Xpenology Compatible Motherboards:
     * ASRock Q1900DC-ITX (Wake on LAN doesn’t work -> driver problem in
       Nanoboot, the rest works perfectly)
     * Gigabyte GA-C1037UN-EUCELERON1007U
     * IO SI-PEX40064(Marvell 88SE9215) – 4-Port Internal SATA3
     * ASUS H61M-A

   Motherboards Known to NOT work:
     * Generic (Jmb363) – 4-Port Internal SATA2 Raid Controller Works with
       hacked NON-RAID, AHCI or IDE BIOS, Original RAID Mode BIOS don’t
       work

Xpenology Status


Is Xpenology Stable?

   As a person interested using Xpenology you should keep in mind, that
   this is not an official Synology release. Although it’s based on the
   official Synology DSM which is the same as whats found on the actual
   Synology devices, it’s not officially supported by Synology. You could
   get support from the community for this software, but not from the
   company itself. Typically once you’re up and running things are very
   stable without any issues but just know that calling support is not an
   option when you’re not running on an official Synology device.

How Easy is it to Update Xpenology?

   Updating Xpenology is pretty easy, especially the minor versions.
   Usually, you’re not missing much between the minor releases but if you
   want to stay up to date just keep an eye on the Xpenology forums and
   someone will post the instructions once they have the new version up
   and running. I typically wait a few months to see if anyone has any
   bugs they ran into. It’s advised to turn off auto-updates to prevent
   your machine from trying to update on its own.

   The major Xpenolgy updates usually take a little longer to get up and
   running but again, if you just wait for the community to post feedback
   and get all of the bugs worked out, you can update whenever you’re
   ready. There is no rush and I typically stay on the older working
   versions until a major release is out.

Conclusion

   If you’re a do-it-yourselfer, then Xpenology would is a great and cheap
   solution for a home project. If you’re looking for a reliable OS for a
   business level NAS, I would advise you to purchase a real Synology
   device. You will not be disappointed and the cost is well worth it.
   Synology has continued to innovate a lot faster than most companies in
   this space and they even have several mobile apps that play along
   nicely with their devices.

   Manufacturers didn’t always make hard drives just for NAS devices. A

   fact, you can probably get away with doing this yourself without any
   major issue. Still, NAS-optimized drives do serve a purpose. Unlike a
