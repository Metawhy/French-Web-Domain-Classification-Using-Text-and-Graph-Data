The History of Finding Email Addresses

   Whether you're trying to sell, market, or recruit, an email address
   provides a direct, personal connection to virtually anyone, from a
   junior exec to the CEO of Google. But with 4.3 billion accounts in
   existence, the real challenge is finding a decision maker's email
   address.

   Over the years, resourceful email hunters have come up with all manner
   of search strategies. The earliest attempts relied on plain old
   guesswork. Later years saw salespeople spend their days sifting through
   hundreds of website pages and social media accounts. Today, more than
   300,000 marketers and sellers use a simpler, smarter approach: Clearbit
   Connect.

   We're recapping the history of email finding, from the first
   prehistoric tactics, through to today's powerful, data-driven tools.

1. Ask for Their Email

   The oldest tactic in the book is also the least effective: asking for
   an email address.

   If a salesperson was able to find a prospect's phone number, locate a
   company contact form, or connect on social media, they could try their
   luck at asking, plainly and simply, if they'd share their email
   address.

   In a world where spam emails and phishing attacks weren't as prevalent,
   this approach could‚Äîoccasionally‚Äîwork. But today, few people are
   willing to offer up their personal information to a complete stranger,
   and asking for an email is more likely to be met with suspicion than
   success.

2. Intelligent Guessing

   When asking for an email address failed, many salespeople would try to
   get lucky and guess it.

   This process relied on the fact that many companies followed simple,
   predictable naming conventions for their email addresses:
     * firstname@company.com or
     * firstnamelastname@company.com

   If they were lucky, finding a contact's address could be as simple as
   applying this email pattern. If they were after the email address of
   Bill Example from software.com, they might try:
     * bill@software.com or
     * billexample@software.com

   Armed with their guesses, they could use a free service like Email
   Checker or MailTester to uncover a verified email, running simple
   diagnostic tests to see whether it was connected to a functional
   mailbox.

   This approach sometimes worked, but because addresses that follow the
   firstname@company.com email format are so easy to guess, many companies
   started using a less obvious naming schema. That's where our next
   strategy came in.

   Accuracy: 2 / 10

3. Search Relevant Websites

   Occasionally, a company will publicize individual contact details on
   their website. Though rare (automated scrapers can find and spam
   publicly listed email addresses), savvy searchers could sometimes find
   their desired email address on one of a handful of key website pages:
     * About us pages sometimes include contact information for individual
       team members.
     * Contact us pages will occasionally offer an email address in
       addition to the obligatory contact form.
     * Author pages (typically found on a blog) offer another shot at
       finding a personal email.

   If these pages failed, personal websites or portfolios (like
   firstnamelastname.com or about.me/firstnamelastname) would sometimes
   offer another shot at success.

   In the likely event that their search failed to yield an email address,
   these pages could still provide other ways ‚Äî like social media‚Äîto get
   in touch with a contact and begin the search again.

   Accuracy: 8 / 10

4. Check WHOIS Lookup

   The WHOIS database provides a record of ownership for websites,
   including contact information for the site's registered owner. By
   searching for their contact's website through the WHOIS lookup service,
   it was sometimes possible to find a working email address.

   If a contact worked at a thousand-strong enterprise company, WHOIS data
   would yield contact information for the domain administrator. By
   applying the same principle to a contact's personal website, you could
   occasionally track down the right email address.

   This approach grew less effective over time: Services like WhoisGuard
   can hide a registrant's contact information, and even if you do find an
   email address, there are no requirements for keeping the information up
   to date.

5. Use an Email Permutator

   Back in 2012, Distilled released a free email permutator spreadsheet,
   designed to systematically generate dozens of best guess email
   variations. Aspiring email hunters could add a contact's first name,
   last name, and company name, and watch 50 possible email addresses
   appear.

   Other free tools follow a similar principle, chopping and changing the
   order of inputted information, adding hyphens, underscores, and other
   common types of punctuation to create an exhaustive list of variations.
   Armed with a list of possible addresses, email validators like
   NeverBounce or MailTester could (hopefully) pick out a legitimate
   email.

   Done on any kind of useful scale, this process was expensive and
   time-consuming. Most effective email validators are paid services,
   costing upwards of $0.01 per email checked. If we validated 50 emails
   per contact, and we did this for 10 people at each of 100 target
   companies, we'd rack up costs of $500 ‚Äî without any guarantee of
   finding a valid email address.

6. Use Google's Search Operators

   If manual attempts to search a website bore no fruit, tenacious email
   hunters could enlist the help of Google's advanced search operators.

   While a regular Google search will scour the entire indexed web,
   searches can be fine-tuned using a handful of commands.
   Site:example.com limits searches to pages within the example.com
   domain; adding quotation marks around a search term includes only exact
   matches; and the * symbol functions as a wild card, returning all pages
   that contain variations of a search term.

   Using these functions, it was possible to build out a few search
   strings to help track down elusive email addresses:
     * site:domain.com ‚Äúfirstname lastname‚Äù email OR contact
     * site:domain.com ‚Äúfirstname lastname‚Äù contact
     * ‚Äúfirstname lastname‚Äù email
     * ‚Äúfirstname lastname‚Äù contact
     * firstname ‚Äú*@example.com‚Äù OR ‚Äú@gmail.com‚Äù

   If they were lucky, and their target email was listed somewhere on the
   public web, these searches‚Äîwith enough time and effort behind
   them‚Äîcould help find it.

7. Check Twitter's Advanced Search

   In 2013, Twitter became one of the 10 most visited websites in the
   world, opening the door to another strategy for finding email
   addresses.

   Occasionally (let's be honest‚Äîvery occasionally), people share their
   email address in their social profiles. With a contact's Twitter
   handle, it became easy to sift through their tweets and find mention of
   an email address. Email hunters would log in to Twitter and load up
   their advanced search page.

   They would add a contact's Twitter handle to the field labeled ‚ÄúFrom
   these accounts,‚Äù and add words they'd associate with an email
   address‚Äîemail, contact me, or a website domain‚Äîto the ‚ÄúAny of these
   words‚Äù field. After hitting search, Twitter would return a complete
   list of every tweet that contained one of the chosen words ‚Äî and
   hopefully, an email address.

8. Export Your LinkedIn Connections

   Recent changes to LinkedIn's data privacy policies have given users the
   right to access all of the data they generate on the site. That
   includes a list of all their contacts ‚Äî and their email addresses.

   This feature can be used by signing in to LinkedIn, and heading to this
   URL. Once there, navigating through dozens of privacy options will
   reveal a section titled ‚ÄúHow LinkedIn uses your data.‚Äù Just below the
   header, there are options for downloading contact data.

   The next step is to select ‚ÄúConnections‚Äù from the grid of options, and
   hit Request archive. After reentering login details and waiting roughly
   10 minutes (longer for accounts with lots of contacts), LinkedIn sends
   an email containing a spreadsheet of contacts data.

   One of the columns contains the email address each contact has saved
   within their social media profiles (in the example below, I've blurred
   out all the real email addresses).

   Though this process is great for quickly soliciting email addresses for
   your entire LinkedIn network (without having to rely on Sales Navigator
   ‚Äî formally known as Rapportive), it only works for contacts: If someone
   refuses a connection request (or doesn't use the platform), the method
   won't work.
