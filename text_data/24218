   "Programming with libxml2 is like the thrilling embrace of an exotic
   stranger." Mark Pilgrim

   Libxml2 is the XML C parser and toolkit developed for the Gnome project
   (but usable outside of the Gnome platform), it is free software
   available under the MIT License. XML itself is a metalanguage to design
   markup languages, i.e. text language where semantic and structure are
   added to the content using extra "markup" information enclosed between
   angle brackets. HTML is the most well-known markup language. Though the
   library is written in C a variety of language bindings make it
   available in other environments.

   Libxml2 is known to be very portable, the library should build and work
   without serious troubles on a variety of systems (Linux, Unix, Windows,
   CygWin, MacOS, MacOS X, RISC Os, OS/2, VMS, QNX, MVS, VxWorks, ...)

   Libxml2 implements a number of existing standards related to markup
   languages:
     * the XML standard: http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml
     * Namespaces in XML: http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/
     * XML Base: http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlbase/
     * RFC 2396 : Uniform Resource Identifiers
       http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt
     * XML Path Language (XPath) 1.0: http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath
     * HTML4 parser: http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/
     * XML Pointer Language (XPointer) Version 1.0:
       http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr
     * XML Inclusions (XInclude) Version 1.0:
       http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/
     * ISO-8859-x encodings, as well as rfc2044 [UTF-8] and rfc2781
       [UTF-16] Unicode encodings, and more if using iconv support

     * W3C XML Schemas Part 2: Datatypes REC 02 May 2001
     * W3C xml:id Working Draft 7 April 2004

   In most cases libxml2 tries to implement the specifications in a
   relatively strictly compliant way. As of release 2.4.16, libxml2 passed
   all 1800+ tests from the OASIS XML Tests Suite.

   To some extent libxml2 provides support for the following additional
   specifications but doesn't claim to implement them completely:
     * Document Object Model (DOM) http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/
       the document model, but it doesn't implement the API itself, gdome2
       does this on top of libxml2
     * RFC 959 : libxml2 implements a basic FTP client code
     * RFC 1945 : HTTP/1.0, again a basic HTTP client code
     * SAX: a SAX2 like interface and a minimal SAX1 implementation
       compatible with early expat versions

   A partial implementation of XML Schemas Part 1: Structure is being
   worked on but it would be far too early to make any conformance
   statement about it at the moment.

   Separate documents:
     * the libxslt page providing an implementation of XSLT 1.0 and common
       extensions like EXSLT for libxml2
     * the gdome2 page : a standard DOM2 implementation for libxml2
     * the XMLSec page: an implementation of W3C XML Digital Signature for
       libxml2
     * also check the related links section for more related and active
       projects.
