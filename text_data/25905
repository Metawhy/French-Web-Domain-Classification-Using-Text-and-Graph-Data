A pop of color and more: updates to Android’s brand

   https://www.blog.goo (BUTTON) Copy link

   Android new logo

   Sameer Samat
   VP of Product Management, Android
   Published Aug 22, 2019

   https://www.blog.goo (BUTTON) Copy link
   ×

   Over the last decade, Android's open platform has created a thriving
   community of manufacturers and developers that reach a global audience
   with their devices and apps. This has expanded beyond phones to
   tablets, cars, watches, TVs and more—with more than 2.5 billion active
   devices around the world. As we continue to build Android for everyone
   in the community, our brand should be as inclusive and accessible as
   possible—and we think we can do better in a few ways.

Android Q is Android 10

   Android with map

   First, we’re changing the way we name our releases. Our engineering
   team has always used internal code names for each version, based off of
   tasty treats, or desserts, in alphabetical order. This naming tradition
   has become a fun part of the release each year externally, too. But
   we’ve heard feedback over the years that the names weren’t always
   understood by everyone in the global community.

   For example, L and R are not distinguishable when spoken in some
   languages. So when some people heard us say Android Lollipop out loud,
   it wasn’t intuitively clear that it referred to the version after
   KitKat. It’s even harder for new Android users, who are unfamiliar with
   the naming convention, to understand if their phone is running the
   latest version. We also know that pies are not a dessert in some
   places, and that marshmallows, while delicious, are not a popular treat
   in many parts of the world.

   As a global operating system, it’s important that these names are clear
   and relatable for everyone in the world. So, this next release of
   Android will simply use the version number and be called Android 10. We
   think this change helps make release names simpler and more intuitive
   for our global community. And while there were many tempting “Q”
   desserts out there, we think that at version 10 and 2.5 billion active
   devices, it was time to make this change.

A refreshed look for the brand

   The Android brand has evolved over time. Back in 2014, we updated our
   logo and brand color, and this year, we’re introducing a more modern,
   accessible look.
   Android new logo with robot

   The design of the logo draws inspiration from the most recognizable
   non-human member of the community, the Android robot. The robot belongs
   to everyone in the community, and has long been a symbol of the fun and
   curiosity at the heart of Android. Now, it has a special place in our
   logo.

   We also changed the logo from green to black. It’s a small change, but
   we found the green was hard to read, especially for people with visual
   impairments. The logo is often paired with colors that can make it hard
   to see—so we came up with a new set of color combinations that improve
   contrast.

The next evolution of Android

   We’ll officially start using the updated logo in the coming weeks with
   the final release of Android 10. Thank you to the community for
   supporting Android and inspiring us over the years.

Our hardware sustainability commitments

   https://www.blog.goo (BUTTON) Copy link

   Google Home Mini.jpg

   Anna Meegan
   Head of Sustainability, Consumer Hardware
   Published Aug 5, 2019

   https://www.blog.goo (BUTTON) Copy link
   ×

   Most of us can’t get through the day without a phone, tablet, computer
   or smart speaker. My team at Google understands this well—we’ve been
   making consumer hardware (like Pixel phones and Google Home Minis) for
   just over three years now. But building these devices and getting them
   into the hands of our customers takes a lot of resources, and disposing
   of our old electronics can create significant waste.

   My job is to integrate sustainability into our products, operations and
   communities—making it not just an aspect of how we do business, but the
   centerpiece of it. It’s an ongoing endeavor that involves designing in
   sustainability from the start and embedding it into the entire product
   development process and across our operations, all while creating the
   products our customers want. This is how we will achieve our ambition
   to leave people, the planet, and our communities better than we found
   them.

   To help us get a step closer to reaching our goals, we’re sharing a set
   of hardware and services sustainability commitments:
     * By 2020, 100 percent of all shipments going to or from customers
       will be carbon neutral
     * Starting in 2022, 100 percent of Made by Google products will
       include recycled materials with a drive to maximize recycled
       content wherever possible.
     * And we will make technology that puts people first and expands
       access to the benefits of technology.

   These commitments will build on the foundation and progress we’ve
   already made. In 2018, we began publishing our product environmental
   reports, which help everyone understand exactly what our products are
   made of, how they’re built and how they get shipped to you. And from
   2017 to 2018, our carbon emissions for product shipments decreased by
   40 percent. We’ve also launched our Power Project, which will bring one
   million energy- and money-saving Nest thermostats to families in need
   by 2023, and built much of our Nest product portfolio with
   post-consumer recycled plastic.

   We’re always working to do more, faster. But today we’re laying the
   foundation for what we believe will be a way of doing business that
   commits to building better products better.

More information about our processes to safeguard speech data

   https://www.blog.goo (BUTTON) Copy link

   David Monsees
   Product Manager, Search
   Published Jul 11, 2019

   https://www.blog.goo (BUTTON) Copy link

   We’re focused on building products that work for everyone, and as part
   of this, we invest significant resources to ensure that our speech
   technology works for a wide variety of languages, accents and dialects.
   This enables products like the Google Assistant to understand your
   request, whether you’re speaking English or Hindi.
   As part of our work to develop speech technology for more languages, we
   partner with language experts around the world who understand the
   nuances and accents of a specific language. These language experts
   review and transcribe a small set of queries to help us better
   understand those languages. This is a critical part of the process of
   building speech technology, and is necessary to creating products like
   the Google Assistant.
   We just learned that one of these language reviewers has violated our
   data security policies by leaking confidential Dutch audio data. Our
   Security and Privacy Response teams have been activated on this issue,
   are investigating, and we will take action. We are conducting a full
   review of our safeguards in this space to prevent misconduct like this
   from happening again.
   We apply a wide range of safeguards to protect user privacy throughout
   the entire review process. Language experts only review around 0.2
   percent of all audio snippets. Audio snippets are not associated with
   user accounts as part of the review process, and reviewers are directed
   not to transcribe background conversations or other noises, and only to
   transcribe snippets that are directed to Google.
   The Google Assistant only sends audio to Google after your device
   detects that you’re interacting with the Assistant—for example, by
   saying “Hey Google” or by physically triggering the Google Assistant. A
   clear indicator (such as the flashing dots on top of a Google Home or
   an on-screen indicator on your Android device) will activate any time
   the device is communicating with Google in order to fulfill your
   request. Rarely, devices that have the Google Assistant built in may
   experience what we call a “false accept.” This means that there was
   some noise or words in the background that our software interpreted to
   be the hotword (like “Ok Google”). We have a number of protections in
   place to prevent false accepts from occurring in your home.
   Building products for everyone is a core part of our DNA at Google. We
   hold ourselves to high standards of privacy and security in product
   development, and hold our partners to these same standards. We also
   provide you with tools to manage and control the data stored in your
   account. You can turn off storing audio data to your Google account
   completely, or choose to auto-delete data after every 3 months or 18
   months. We’re always working to improve how we explain our settings and
   privacy practices to people, and will be reviewing opportunities to
   further clarify how data is used to improve speech technology. Visit
   your account to review or change your settings, and view (and, if you
   choose, delete) all the activity that's stored with your account.

Proposed copyright rules: bad for small publishers, European consumers and
online services

   https://www.blog.goo (BUTTON) Copy link
   ×

   richard gingras
   Richard Gingras
   VP, News
   Published Dec 6, 2018

   https://www.blog.goo (BUTTON) Copy link
   ×

   Copyright rules give news publishers rights over how their work is
   used. Europe is updating these rules for this digital age, and that’s a
   move Google supports. But the European Parliament’s version of a new
   copyright directive—specifically Article 11 and its recital 32—will
   have unintended consequences for smaller news publishers, limit
   innovation in journalism and reduce choice for European consumers. We
   urgently call on policymakers to fix this in the final text of the
   directive.

   Let us be clear on one thing: Article 11 seeks to protect journalists
   and their work, and we agree with that goal. We care deeply about
   supporting the broader news industry because journalism is critical to
   the functioning of a free democracy. And we built Google to provide
   everyone with equal access to information.
   However, Article 11 could change that principle and require online
   services to strike commercial deals with publishers to show hyperlinks
   and short snippets of news. This means that search engines, news
   aggregators, apps, and platforms would have to put commercial licences
   in place, and make decisions about which content to include on the
   basis of those licensing agreements and which to leave out.

   Effectively, companies like Google will be put in the position of
   picking winners and losers. Online services, some of which generate no
   revenue (for instance, Google News) would have to make choices about
   which publishers they’d do deals with. Presently, more than 80,000 news
   publishers around the world can show up in Google News, but Article 11
   would sharply reduce that number. And this is not just about Google,
   it’s unlikely any business will be able to license every single news
   publisher in the European Union, especially given the very broad
   definition being proposed.
   This would mostly benefit larger players. One analysis has forecast
   that in Germany, small publishers would receive less than 1 percent of
   the revenue generated by a so-called ancillary copyright—whereas the
   largest publishing group alone would receive 64 percent. Smaller
   newsrooms and overall online news diversity will be impacted as a
   result.
   Because so much of the conversation in Brussels is driven by larger
   publishing organizations, the small publishers who raise this concern
   are not heard. Why are large influential companies constraining how new
   and small publishers operate? Particularly at a time when news business
   models continue to evolve, new, small, and innovative publishers need
   flexibility. The proposed rules will undoubtedly hurt diversity of
   voices, with large publishers setting business models for the whole
   industry. This will not benefit all equally.

   Not only might this harm individual news publishers, it also seriously
   risks reducing consumers’ ability to discover and access a diversity of
   views and opinions. Unlike people in other parts of the world, European
   citizens may no longer find the most relevant news across the web, but
   rather the news that online services have been able to commercially
   license. We believe the information we show should be based on quality,
   not on payment. And we believe it’s not in the interest of European
   citizens to change that.
   Today we drive economic value to publishers by sending people to news
   sites over 10 billion times a month. That free traffic has enabled many
   smaller or emerging publishers to get discovered, grow a business, and
   find success online. A Deloitte study found that each user visit was
   worth on average between €0.04 and €0.08 to publishers. That means real
   business value to European publishers, every year.

   We recognize the news industry is undergoing substantial change as
   publishers around the world transition to digital. We’ve been working
   with EU institutions to develop workable solutions that benefit
   journalists and publishers. We’ve invested in creating tools to help
   publishers increase subscription revenue and enable mobile sites to be
   much faster, so that they can grow their audiences and their revenue.
   Thousands of news publishers use Google advertising services where they
   retain 70 percent and more of the revenue that’s generated.
   There is a way to avoid the unintended consequences of Article 11. The
   copyright directive should give all publishers the right to control
   their own business models and destiny by giving them the choice to
   waive the need for a commercial license for their content. Publishers—
   big and small—should continue to be able to make their own choices
   about how their content can be discovered and how they want to make
   money with that content. The exact language of the new rules is being
   determined in the next few weeks. Now is not the time to stifle
   innovation in news or limit access to quality journalism.
