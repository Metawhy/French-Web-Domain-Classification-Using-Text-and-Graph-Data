   Over the last few months, we have seen increased Exploit Kit activity.
   One example is the Fallout Exploit Kit, which we will describe in depth
   in this article. Since its emergence in August 2018, threat actors have
   intensively used the Fallout Exploit Kit to deliver ransomware
   (GandCrab, Kraken, Maze, Minotaur, Matrix and Stop), Banker Trojans
   (DanaBot) and information stealers (RaccoonStealer, AZORult, Vidar),
   and others.

   Malicious ads have become a standard means for exploit kits to reach
   vulnerable systems. Because of the complex redirection chain provided
   by ad services, malicious ads remain an extremely effective attack
   vector to deliver exploits and, finally, malware.

   Bitdefender researchers Mihai Neagu and Cosmin Carp have taken a closer
   look at the Fallout Exploit kit as used in a campaign that leads to
   Raccoon Stealer. The key findings are available in the paper below.

   malware or writing removal tools, he teaches extreme sports such as
   surfing the web without protection or rodeo with wild Trojan horses. He
   believes that most things in life can be beat with strong heuristics
   and that antimalware research is like working for a secret agency: you
   need to stay focused at all times, but you get all the glory when you
   catch the bad guys.
