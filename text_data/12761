Tallinn by the seasons: a year-round guide to Estonia’s capital

When you’re situated as far north as Estonia’s fairytale capital, each season
has its own distinct personality. Summer days seem to stretch forever, but so
do winter nights. Within their turreted old-town walls, the locals have
learned to cope with nature’s rhythms with season-specific traditions and
tailored festivals to get them through even the coldest of months.

   Why you should visit Tallinn in winter

Winter’s festive spirit

   If you think the frigid gloom of Baltic winter is an unappealing time
   to visit Tallinn, you’ve clearly never seen the snow glistening on the
   old-town roofs, or skated around the Harju Ice Rink under the shadow of
   13th-century St Nicholas’ Church.

   Tallinn

   It was in 1441 that the unfortunately-named Brotherhood of the Black
   Heads (a guild for unmarried merchants) erected the world’s first
   publicly displayed Christmas tree on picturesque Town Hall Square. Each
   year in mid-November a huge tree is installed and decorated at the
   centre of the square, remaining there until nearly the end of January.
   A Christmas market is held at its base, full of stallholders selling
   local crafts, hõõgvein (mulled wine) and roasted sweet almonds. Another
   traditional Christmas treat, verivorst (a blood sausage wrapped in
   pig’s intestine), is more of an acquired taste.

   In Estonia, winter is a time for warming soups, stews, roast meat and
   sauerkraut – but if hearty stodge fails to take the chill off, locals
   indulge in their favourite naked communal pastime: sweating it out in
   the sauna. Many hotels have saunas for their guests, but the luxurious
   private facilities of Club 26, atop the Radisson Blu Hotel Olümpia, can
   be booked by anyone. The Kalev Spa Waterpark is a more egalitarian
   option, or for the traditional Russian banya (bathhouse) experience –
   complete with a birch-branch bashing – head to Kalma Saun.

Spring in full bloom

   It takes a while for Tallinn to shrug off its white mantle, but any
   remaining icicles are bebopped away during the Jazzkaar Festival in mid
   April, showcasing Jazz greats from around the world. Neighbourhoods
   spring to life for community events such as Kalamaja Days, a mid-May
   block party with outdoor concerts and markets. Cafes start to arrange
   tables on the squares and restaurants garland their streetside terraces
   with flower boxes – while still ensuring that there are blankets at
   hand for customers to dispel any lingering chills. Spring produce
   transforms menus with the likes of wild garlic, sorrel, goat’s cheese,
   new-season lamb and rhubarb.

   The best places to see spring blooms are the Tallinn Botanic Garden, by
   the banks of the Pirita River in Kloostrimetsa, and gorgeous Kadriorg
   Park. Kadriorg, meaning ‘Catherine’s Valley’, is the formal garden of a
   tsarist-era palace, built by Peter the Great for his wife Catherine in
   the 18th century.

Summertime activities

   Summer is by far the most popular time to visit Tallinn; the warmer
   weather spawning an influx of cruise-ship passengers crowding the
   streets of Old Town. They’re usually all gone by early evening, so make
   like a local and head to the beach at Pirita or Stroomi during the
   middle of the day. Alternatively, head out on a kayak tour with the
   likes of Reimann Retked to Aegna Island. Return in the evening for al
   fresco dining in the city squares, feasting on the summer harvest of
   fresh vegetables and berries.

   Summer is also the prime festival season, kicking off with the
   medieval-themed Old Town Days in late May. The three Baltic capitals
   (Tallinn, Rīga and Vilnius) take turns to host Baltic Pride; Tallinn’s
   turn next comes up in June 2020.

   Estonia reserves their biggest annual celebration for magical
   Midsummer’s Eve on June 23. Although Midsummer has been given a
   Christian name (Jaanipäev, meaning St John’s Day), there’s more than a
   touch of the pagan to these communal gatherings around the bonfire,
   where you’ll still spot damsels with a garland of flowers or oak leaves
   in their hair. The sun barely sets at all and it’s considered very bad
   luck to go to sleep until the hour or so of twilight passes. While most
   Estonians prefer to escape for the countryside on Midsummer, the best
   place in Tallinn to experience the festivities is the Estonian Open-Air
   Museum in the city’s west. This wonderful expanse of coastal forest has
   been populated with heritage buildings, bringing the countryside to the
   city. Throughout summer, costumed staff demonstrate traditional skills
   amongst the transplanted farm buildings, windmills, taverns and
   churches.

   July’s Medieval Days bring jousting demonstrations and a costumed
   carnival to the edge of the Old Town, while Maritime Days moves the
   action to the city’s marinas and fascinating Seaplane Harbour. Things
   are rather more decorous during the Tallinn Organ Festival and August’s
   Birgitta Festival, a week-long series of classical music, dance and
   theatre performances held within the enigmatic shell of a ruined
   convent.

Autumn’s vibrant colours

   As the weather cools down, head to Kadriorg Park, the Tallinn Botanic
   Garden or the Open-Air Museum to see the leaves changing. Other good
   places include Kalamaja Park, to the west of the Old Town, and Viimsi
   Open Air Museum, a preserved 19th-century farm and seaside village in
   the city’s northeast. It’s also a brilliant time to take a day trip to
   Lahemaa National Park – the ‘Land of Bays’ – a blissful stretch of
   coastal forest 45km east of the city, crisscrossed with hiking and
   biking tracks.

   Autumn is hunting season, so expect game meats to begin appearing on
   menus. It’s also a prime time for foraging for mushrooms, a traditional
   activity which is something of a national obsession.

   As nights lengthen, September’s Wandering Lights festival turns
   Kadriorg Park into a fairyland, with light installations illuminating
   the palace gardens. Performers also brighten spirits on the main stage
   set up on Town Hall Square. Towards the end of the season, locals take
   their minds off the impending winter with the Black Nights Film
   Festival, held in mid November.

How to photograph Yosemite like Ansel Adams

I’m a good photographer, but obviously no Ansel Adams. Adams had a unique
style – a way of photographing landscapes playing with light and shadow,
creating iconic images both stark and beautiful – and on a recent trip to
Yosemite National Park, I learned how to capture some of that magic myself.

   to photograph Yosemite like Ansel Adams

   President Gerald Ford's daughter – is known for his shots of Yosemite ©

Find just the right angle

   Although Adams traveled the world, the place he’s most closely
   identified with is Yosemite – California’s most awe-inspiring location,
   made even more so by his photographs. The photographers who work at the
   nearby Ansel Adams Gallery have studied his techniques, and pass on
   that wisdom to thousands of amateur snapshot-takers and aspiring
   auteurs each year. Nearly every day, the gallery offers low-cost group
   clinics, teaching visitors to take better photographs.

   But I wanted something a little more. So I plunked down $375 for an
   afternoon private tour and lesson with one of the gallery’s pros. Can a
   four-hour one-on-one session with one of these trained tutors transform
   my images from ‘meh’ to magnificent? More importantly, will I see an
   increase in Instagram likes?

   I was on the fence about plunking down that much money until the day
   before, when I struggled to get the exact image I wanted at Vernal
   Falls. I had hiked more than eight miles round-trip, hoping for a big
   photographic payoff – I wanted the rushing water to have a creamy,
   cotton-candy look as it flowed over the edge. But because I was hiking
   mid-day, the slow shutter speed left nearly all my images overexposed,
   blowing out the whites of the water and leaving the rest washed out. I
   was determined not to blow another opportunity while I was in this
   cathedral of nature.

Focus one-third in front of the main subject

   Photographer Kirk Keeler, who has been living near and photographing
   Yosemite for nearly 10 years, took me on my tour and tutoring session.
   Within five minutes, we were at our first location, a few hundred yards
   behind Yosemite Valley Lodge. The stillness of the Merced River
   mirrored El Capitan and the more distant Half Dome, the two most famous
   granite monoliths in Yosemite and perhaps the world.

   Instead of focusing on the center of the frame, Keeler suggested
   focusing about one-third in front of the main subject, which would give
   maximum depth of field to the remaining two-thirds behind it. Shooting
   in aperture-priority mode, Keeler also suggested I use an f-stop
   between F9 and F11, as that is the sweet spot for most lenses.

   Even in locations around the park where we seemingly didn’t need our
   tripods, Keeler urged me to use it. ‘The tripod forces you to consider
   your shot more carefully as you frame it (in the viewfinder),’ he said,
   before adding with a smile, ‘plus, Ansel used one.’ I quickly realized
   Keeler was right about the tripod; it made me slow down and ponder
   exactly what I wanted in my photo.

   famous icons © Robert Annis / Lonely Planet

Let the histogram guide you

   The most important lesson was paying closer attention to the histogram.
   Before, I’d pop off a few shots, take a quick glimpse at the back of
   the camera at what I’d just taken, then rush to take several more
   photos. But by looking at the histogram, I was able to see in real-time
   if a photo would be useable. If the clouds were blown out and flashing,
   I dialed back the exposure until I was able to capture them in all
   their fluffy glory. The rest of the image might be a bit dark, but
   that’s a quick fix during editing.

   For the rest of the afternoon we traveled down the river, trying to
   capture different vantage points of the two mountains and the waterway.
   Ironically, perhaps my favorite shot from the day wasn’t a towering
   mountain but a simple backlit and somewhat bare pine tree reflected in
   the river.

   Planet

Adjust with the light

   With the clock winding down on our session, we headed to the famous
   Tunnel View vista. Even with more than an hour to sunset, prime viewing
   spots were filling up. Luckily, we managed to find two spots along the
   stone barrier to set up our tripods and discuss our plan of attack. As
   the sun dropped lower in the horizon behind us, the light on the
   mountains changed; streaks began to appear on El Capitan, before
   bathing the range in a soft, buttery glow.

   As Keeler pointed out particular areas, I quickly changed lenses on my
   Sony A6500, going from wide-angle to telephoto and back, trying to
   capture specific details on the faraway mountains before the light
   disappeared. Then it did.

Lean on the lessons of a professional

   So was my afternoon photo excursion worth it?

   My only regret was having only a few kinds of shots; most of the photos
   I took had the same mountains and river, just from different angles.
   Keeler had planned to take me further down the river to an
   off-the-beaten path spot with rocks and swirling water, but an accident
   clogged the road, so we retreated to a different spot.

   In the end, that’s only a minor gripe. When you’re in the Yosemite
   Valley, El Capitan and Half Dome are the superstars.

   Nearly 400 bucks is a lot of money to a freelance photographer, but the
   tips Keeler gave me are already starting to pay dividends in my
   photography. Now if only my Instagram likes would pick up.

   spot to shoot the granite monolith © Robert Annis / Lonely Planet

5 iconic spots to photograph Yosemite

   1. Valley View/Tunnel View: When you think of Yosemite, this is
   probably the view you’re envisioning – El Capitan and Half Dome staring
   at one another, with either the Merced River or a grove of pine trees
   in the foreground. Late afternoon and sunset are the best times for
   photographs.

   2. Vernal Falls: Getting to the top of Vernal Falls requires a 3.5-mile
   hike each way. The best vantage points are just off a steep and narrow
   granite path. Luckily there’s enough room in a few places to step off
   the trail and set up a tripod. This is one of the most popular hikes in
   the park, so be prepared to shoot around other tourists.

   3. El Capitan at the Bend in the Merced River: There’s no signage for
   the trail that leads out to this vantage point, so either ask around or
   study a map.

   4. Half Dome from the Glacier Point Viewpoint: Sunrise is the ideal
   time for photographing a gorgeous vantage of Half Dome. The best
   vantage points are on a large paved path, maybe a tenth-of-a-mile from
   the small visitor center.

   5. Sentinel Dome: Because Sentinel Dome has a 360-degree view of the
   area, it’s good for either sunrise or sunset photos. The Dome is an
   easy 1-mile hike from the trailhead. From there, you can continue on to
   Taft Point, which is nearly 3 miles from the Dome.

With the Thomas Cook collapse, what next for the package holiday?

With the collapse of Thomas Cook, is the traditional European
sun-sea-and-sand package holiday doomed? It’s almost unbelievable to imagine
a the world of travel without Thomas Cook, one of the stalwarts of the
package and low-cost tourism industry.

   Crowds of people stand in an airport waiting.

Thousands of holidaymakers stranded after Thomas Cook collapse

   The idea of such a historic company disappearing is a warning that
   others may follow suit during turbulent times for the travel industry,
   with oil volatility, ongoing Brexit uncertainty and – as the result of
   ordered Boeing 737 MAX aircraft being unavailable during its grounding
   – capacity concerns for next summer’s schedules.

   The European package tour has been an iconic option for decades. Seven
   nights with the family in a bucket-and-spade
   destination, lads-or-lasses holiday somewhere more lively or quiet
   pensioners' holidays in the sun to escape the depths of
   winter: northern Europeans have been heading south for sun in droves
   for nearly 70 years. Reform of the way non-scheduled airlines – in
   other words, charter operators like Thomas Cook – were regulated in the
   mid-1950s led to a boom in sunseekers everywhere from Helsinki to
   Hartlepool travelling to sunnier climes.

What has changed for package holidays?

   The wide availability of the Internet starting in the early 2000s drove
   several changes to the fundamental structure of the industry, just as
   the lustre was starting to wear off the popularity of the package
   holiday after the status-symbol-driven 1980s and 1990s.

   For a start, the low-cost carrier boom that had started in the
   mid-1990s went digital. Airlines including Ryanair and easyJet, broke
   the binary: you no longer had to choose between a scheduled airline
   like British Airways or Air France or a package tour operator like
   Britannia or Monarch. They also prompted established carriers to cut
   costs and offer cheaper packages of their own, either directly or
   through subsidiaries like Finnair’s Aurinkomatkat tour operator.

   The digital revolution also enabled companies other than the
   traditional tour operators to thrive – the dotcoms that started to
   dominate (and still do in many areas), started offering package tours
   in conjunction with a low-cost airline. Your author remembers a
   delightful snowy January package booking from London to Venice (via
   Treviso) flying Ryanair and staying at a local pensione
   bed-and-breakfast; this change to the entire way the model works rather
   took the traditional tour operators by surprise.

Are travellers still going on package holidays?

   The package holiday was and is still big business. Touring the airport
   at Gran Canaria earlier this year, airport management told me that
   their working assumption based on the number of tour buses using the
   airport is that some two fifths of travellers using the airport are
   still arriving part of a package holiday to the many resorts around the
   island.

   This is underscored by the fact that priority at pick-up and drop-off
   is given to the many brightly branded coaches collecting up to fifty
   passengers at a time: the parking lane directly next to the terminal is
   for buses, not car drop-off, and an impressive corkscrew brings these
   coaches directly down to the arrivals parking area to pick up the next
   load. Indeed, anyone driving into the tourist centre of Maspalomas on
   Gran Canaria will probably drive along the Avenida Touroperador Tui — a
   sign of both the historic and ongoing importance of these companies to
   the island.

   With a trend towards more specialised, intergenerational and group
   travel, and particularly since the rise of Airbnb and its competitors
   in the last decade, travellers are more used to booking their own
   accommodation and flights separately. But, within the EU and especially
   from the UK with its ATOL booking protection for package holidays, will
   the high-profile collapse of Monarch and now Thomas Cook affect the
   number of passengers booking packages?

   taken on 23 September shows the cancelled flights of the Thomas Cook
   airlines at the Larnaca International Airport © IAKOVOS HATZISTAVROU /

What is the future of package holidays?

   It seems certain that there is still a role for package holidays in the
   travel of the future, but perhaps not as we know them. As much as there
   is a clear trend towards authentic experiences for many travellers,
   there’s a competing trend where sometimes it’s just nice to have
   everything done for you on a trip, especially for those of us who are
   the unofficial family travel agents.

   Moreover, Airbnb has been something of a victim of its own success:
   there is backlash from communities turning into largely unregulated
   tourist hotspots and, anecdotally at least, there seems to be
   an unpleasant trend of late cancellations by hosts, leaving travellers
   in the lurch.

   If I had to look into a crystal ball, though, I’d predict that the
   remaining tour operators will become more nimble and specialised. It
   strikes me that there is little innovation in, say, package tourism
   friendly to the LGBTQIA+ market, Muslim families who require privacy
   for hijab-free holidays, and to the ever-growing
   premium-but-cost-conscious retiree travel market.

   Nor are there many options for larger accommodation suitable for
   intergenerational travel: separate bedrooms for granny and grandpa with
   fully accessible showers, and enough flexibility for extended family to
   be connected via adjoining doors between multiple single units, for
   example.

   they chat next to a wall. Two workers of British travel group Thomas
   Cook speak at Son Sant Joan airport in Palma de Mallorca © JAIME REINA

   So raise a glass to Thomas Cook and its successors, and spare a thought
   for the many thousands of dedicated and hardworking employees who find
   themselves facing uncertainty about their jobs, as well as the
   travellers whose holidays are ending in stress or in jeopardy.

What happens if you don’t put your phone on airplane mode on a flight?

It’s not that long ago that airlines stopped telling passengers to keep their
mobile phones, tablets, e-readers and other devices turned off throughout the
flight. Remember the time in 2011 when Alec Baldwin was kicked off an
American Airlines plane after becoming disruptive when a flight attendant
told him to stop playing Words with Friends? Airlines take this stuff
seriously for a reason.

   Images

Why do we have to put our phones on flight mode?

   We’re asked to turn our devices off or to flight mode because of
   electromagnetic interference from phones, tablets, e-readers,
   electronic headsets, and more. Since some planes were built before
   these became a thing, it took a while for the industry to make sure it
   was entirely safe to use them.

   These days, you’ll even see iPads and other tablets in the flight deck,
   which pilots use to store paperwork instead of lugging around big bags
   with actual paper in. You’ll see flight attendants using tablets and
   big phones too, either instead of or in addition to those reams and
   reams of dot-matrix printed paperwork. All those devices have been
   tested extensively to make sure there’s no interference.

   How to get the most out of your devices while travelling

   But that hasn’t always been the case! In fact, back in 2011, some parts
   within specific models of flight deck screen on certain Boeing 737
   aircraft proved to be susceptible to interference. How’d we find out
   that specific combination of planes and monitors — and fix it? During
   the rigorous testing process to enable airlines to offer inflight
   internet, that’s how. Part of that testing process is creating enough
   electromagnetic interference to represent an entire cabin full of
   devices of a variety of sizes, including some that are malfunctioning.
   Pretty much every airliner-equipment combo operated by a major
   international airline has now been tested.

   airport mode" © Getty Image

What happens if I don't put my phone on airplane mode?

   For years, safety regulators, airlines, aircraft manufacturers and
   everyone else in the industry has known that there are dozens of
   devices left out of airplane mode on every flight. In a way, the fact
   that planes haven’t fallen out of the sky willy-nilly because someone
   left their Kindle on is the best demonstration that, for the most part,
   most devices don’t affect most planes.

   But most isn’t good enough for aviation. Some folks don’t know that
   their Kindle even has 3G, or that the Bluetooth on their
   watch/headphones/other device counts as needing to be in airplane mode.
   Some forget that they’ve packed one of those devices in the overhead
   bin. Some even blatantly ignore the rules, assuming that their vital
   email on that BlackBerry isn’t going to make their plane start to
   plummet. And it probably isn’t.

   Just how fresh is the food served in your airline meal?

   Here’s the thing: aviation doesn’t work on probablys. One of the
   reasons why aviation is safer than getting in your car, crossing the
   street, or even just staying at home (more people are casualties of
   toilet-related incidents than aviation accidents!) is that airlines and
   their regulators work with an abundance of caution.

   interference from phones and tablets © Getty Images

Tallinn by the seasons: a year-round guide to Estonia’s capital

When you’re situated as far north as Estonia’s fairytale capital, each season
has its own distinct personality. Summer days seem to stretch forever, but so
do winter nights. Within their turreted old-town walls, the locals have
learned to cope with nature’s rhythms with season-specific traditions and
tailored festivals to get them through even the coldest of months.

   Why you should visit Tallinn in winter

Winter’s festive spirit

   If you think the frigid gloom of Baltic winter is an unappealing time
   to visit Tallinn, you’ve clearly never seen the snow glistening on the
   old-town roofs, or skated around the Harju Ice Rink under the shadow of
   13th-century St Nicholas’ Church.

   Tallinn

   It was in 1441 that the unfortunately-named Brotherhood of the Black
   Heads (a guild for unmarried merchants) erected the world’s first
   publicly displayed Christmas tree on picturesque Town Hall Square. Each
   year in mid-November a huge tree is installed and decorated at the
   centre of the square, remaining there until nearly the end of January.
   A Christmas market is held at its base, full of stallholders selling
   local crafts, hõõgvein (mulled wine) and roasted sweet almonds. Another
   traditional Christmas treat, verivorst (a blood sausage wrapped in
   pig’s intestine), is more of an acquired taste.

   In Estonia, winter is a time for warming soups, stews, roast meat and
   sauerkraut – but if hearty stodge fails to take the chill off, locals
   indulge in their favourite naked communal pastime: sweating it out in
   the sauna. Many hotels have saunas for their guests, but the luxurious
   private facilities of Club 26, atop the Radisson Blu Hotel Olümpia, can
   be booked by anyone. The Kalev Spa Waterpark is a more egalitarian
   option, or for the traditional Russian banya (bathhouse) experience –
   complete with a birch-branch bashing – head to Kalma Saun.

Spring in full bloom

   It takes a while for Tallinn to shrug off its white mantle, but any
   remaining icicles are bebopped away during the Jazzkaar Festival in mid
   April, showcasing Jazz greats from around the world. Neighbourhoods
   spring to life for community events such as Kalamaja Days, a mid-May
   block party with outdoor concerts and markets. Cafes start to arrange
   tables on the squares and restaurants garland their streetside terraces
   with flower boxes – while still ensuring that there are blankets at
   hand for customers to dispel any lingering chills. Spring produce
   transforms menus with the likes of wild garlic, sorrel, goat’s cheese,
   new-season lamb and rhubarb.

   The best places to see spring blooms are the Tallinn Botanic Garden, by
   the banks of the Pirita River in Kloostrimetsa, and gorgeous Kadriorg
   Park. Kadriorg, meaning ‘Catherine’s Valley’, is the formal garden of a
   tsarist-era palace, built by Peter the Great for his wife Catherine in
   the 18th century.

Summertime activities

   Summer is by far the most popular time to visit Tallinn; the warmer
   weather spawning an influx of cruise-ship passengers crowding the
   streets of Old Town. They’re usually all gone by early evening, so make
   like a local and head to the beach at Pirita or Stroomi during the
   middle of the day. Alternatively, head out on a kayak tour with the
   likes of Reimann Retked to Aegna Island. Return in the evening for al
   fresco dining in the city squares, feasting on the summer harvest of
   fresh vegetables and berries.

   Summer is also the prime festival season, kicking off with the
   medieval-themed Old Town Days in late May. The three Baltic capitals
   (Tallinn, Rīga and Vilnius) take turns to host Baltic Pride; Tallinn’s
   turn next comes up in June 2020.

   Estonia reserves their biggest annual celebration for magical
   Midsummer’s Eve on June 23. Although Midsummer has been given a
   Christian name (Jaanipäev, meaning St John’s Day), there’s more than a
   touch of the pagan to these communal gatherings around the bonfire,
   where you’ll still spot damsels with a garland of flowers or oak leaves
   in their hair. The sun barely sets at all and it’s considered very bad
   luck to go to sleep until the hour or so of twilight passes. While most
   Estonians prefer to escape for the countryside on Midsummer, the best
   place in Tallinn to experience the festivities is the Estonian Open-Air
   Museum in the city’s west. This wonderful expanse of coastal forest has
   been populated with heritage buildings, bringing the countryside to the
   city. Throughout summer, costumed staff demonstrate traditional skills
   amongst the transplanted farm buildings, windmills, taverns and
   churches.

   July’s Medieval Days bring jousting demonstrations and a costumed
   carnival to the edge of the Old Town, while Maritime Days moves the
   action to the city’s marinas and fascinating Seaplane Harbour. Things
   are rather more decorous during the Tallinn Organ Festival and August’s
   Birgitta Festival, a week-long series of classical music, dance and
   theatre performances held within the enigmatic shell of a ruined
   convent.

Autumn’s vibrant colours

   As the weather cools down, head to Kadriorg Park, the Tallinn Botanic
   Garden or the Open-Air Museum to see the leaves changing. Other good
   places include Kalamaja Park, to the west of the Old Town, and Viimsi
   Open Air Museum, a preserved 19th-century farm and seaside village in
   the city’s northeast. It’s also a brilliant time to take a day trip to
   Lahemaa National Park – the ‘Land of Bays’ – a blissful stretch of
   coastal forest 45km east of the city, crisscrossed with hiking and
   biking tracks.

   Autumn is hunting season, so expect game meats to begin appearing on
   menus. It’s also a prime time for foraging for mushrooms, a traditional
   activity which is something of a national obsession.

   As nights lengthen, September’s Wandering Lights festival turns
   Kadriorg Park into a fairyland, with light installations illuminating
   the palace gardens. Performers also brighten spirits on the main stage
   set up on Town Hall Square. Towards the end of the season, locals take
   their minds off the impending winter with the Black Nights Film
   Festival, held in mid November.

How to photograph Yosemite like Ansel Adams

I’m a good photographer, but obviously no Ansel Adams. Adams had a unique
style – a way of photographing landscapes playing with light and shadow,
creating iconic images both stark and beautiful – and on a recent trip to
Yosemite National Park, I learned how to capture some of that magic myself.

   President Gerald Ford's daughter – is known for his shots of Yosemite ©

Find just the right angle

   Although Adams traveled the world, the place he’s most closely
   identified with is Yosemite – California’s most awe-inspiring location,
   made even more so by his photographs. The photographers who work at the
   nearby Ansel Adams Gallery have studied his techniques, and pass on
   that wisdom to thousands of amateur snapshot-takers and aspiring
   auteurs each year. Nearly every day, the gallery offers low-cost group
   clinics, teaching visitors to take better photographs.

   But I wanted something a little more. So I plunked down $375 for an
   afternoon private tour and lesson with one of the gallery’s pros. Can a
   four-hour one-on-one session with one of these trained tutors transform
   my images from ‘meh’ to magnificent? More importantly, will I see an
   increase in Instagram likes?

   I was on the fence about plunking down that much money until the day
   before, when I struggled to get the exact image I wanted at Vernal
   Falls. I had hiked more than eight miles round-trip, hoping for a big
   photographic payoff – I wanted the rushing water to have a creamy,
   cotton-candy look as it flowed over the edge. But because I was hiking
   mid-day, the slow shutter speed left nearly all my images overexposed,
   blowing out the whites of the water and leaving the rest washed out. I
   was determined not to blow another opportunity while I was in this
   cathedral of nature.

Focus one-third in front of the main subject

   Photographer Kirk Keeler, who has been living near and photographing
   Yosemite for nearly 10 years, took me on my tour and tutoring session.
   Within five minutes, we were at our first location, a few hundred yards
   behind Yosemite Valley Lodge. The stillness of the Merced River
   mirrored El Capitan and the more distant Half Dome, the two most famous
   granite monoliths in Yosemite and perhaps the world.

   Instead of focusing on the center of the frame, Keeler suggested
   focusing about one-third in front of the main subject, which would give
   maximum depth of field to the remaining two-thirds behind it. Shooting
   in aperture-priority mode, Keeler also suggested I use an f-stop
   between F9 and F11, as that is the sweet spot for most lenses.

   Even in locations around the park where we seemingly didn’t need our
   tripods, Keeler urged me to use it. ‘The tripod forces you to consider
   your shot more carefully as you frame it (in the viewfinder),’ he said,
   before adding with a smile, ‘plus, Ansel used one.’ I quickly realized
   Keeler was right about the tripod; it made me slow down and ponder
   exactly what I wanted in my photo.

   famous icons © Robert Annis / Lonely Planet

Let the histogram guide you

   The most important lesson was paying closer attention to the histogram.
   Before, I’d pop off a few shots, take a quick glimpse at the back of
   the camera at what I’d just taken, then rush to take several more
   photos. But by looking at the histogram, I was able to see in real-time
   if a photo would be useable. If the clouds were blown out and flashing,
   I dialed back the exposure until I was able to capture them in all
   their fluffy glory. The rest of the image might be a bit dark, but
   that’s a quick fix during editing.

   For the rest of the afternoon we traveled down the river, trying to
   capture different vantage points of the two mountains and the waterway.
   Ironically, perhaps my favorite shot from the day wasn’t a towering
   mountain but a simple backlit and somewhat bare pine tree reflected in
   the river.

   Planet

Adjust with the light

   With the clock winding down on our session, we headed to the famous
   Tunnel View vista. Even with more than an hour to sunset, prime viewing
   spots were filling up. Luckily, we managed to find two spots along the
   stone barrier to set up our tripods and discuss our plan of attack. As
   the sun dropped lower in the horizon behind us, the light on the
   mountains changed; streaks began to appear on El Capitan, before
   bathing the range in a soft, buttery glow.

   As Keeler pointed out particular areas, I quickly changed lenses on my
   Sony A6500, going from wide-angle to telephoto and back, trying to
   capture specific details on the faraway mountains before the light
   disappeared. Then it did.

Lean on the lessons of a professional

   So was my afternoon photo excursion worth it?

   My only regret was having only a few kinds of shots; most of the photos
   I took had the same mountains and river, just from different angles.
   Keeler had planned to take me further down the river to an
   off-the-beaten path spot with rocks and swirling water, but an accident
   clogged the road, so we retreated to a different spot.

   In the end, that’s only a minor gripe. When you’re in the Yosemite
   Valley, El Capitan and Half Dome are the superstars.

   Nearly 400 bucks is a lot of money to a freelance photographer, but the
   tips Keeler gave me are already starting to pay dividends in my
   photography. Now if only my Instagram likes would pick up.

5 iconic spots to photograph Yosemite

   1. Valley View/Tunnel View: When you think of Yosemite, this is
   probably the view you’re envisioning – El Capitan and Half Dome staring
   at one another, with either the Merced River or a grove of pine trees
   in the foreground. Late afternoon and sunset are the best times for
   photographs.

   2. Vernal Falls: Getting to the top of Vernal Falls requires a 3.5-mile
   hike each way. The best vantage points are just off a steep and narrow
   granite path. Luckily there’s enough room in a few places to step off
   the trail and set up a tripod. This is one of the most popular hikes in
   the park, so be prepared to shoot around other tourists.

   3. El Capitan at the Bend in the Merced River: There’s no signage for
   the trail that leads out to this vantage point, so either ask around or
   study a map.

   4. Half Dome from the Glacier Point Viewpoint: Sunrise is the ideal
   time for photographing a gorgeous vantage of Half Dome. The best
   vantage points are on a large paved path, maybe a tenth-of-a-mile from
   the small visitor center.

   5. Sentinel Dome: Because Sentinel Dome has a 360-degree view of the
   area, it’s good for either sunrise or sunset photos. The Dome is an
   easy 1-mile hike from the trailhead. From there, you can continue on to
   Taft Point, which is nearly 3 miles from the Dome.

With the Thomas Cook collapse, what next for the package holiday?

With the collapse of Thomas Cook, is the traditional European
sun-sea-and-sand package holiday doomed? It’s almost unbelievable to imagine
a the world of travel without Thomas Cook, one of the stalwarts of the
package and low-cost tourism industry.

   Crowds of people stand in an airport waiting.

Thousands of holidaymakers stranded after Thomas Cook collapse

   The idea of such a historic company disappearing is a warning that
   others may follow suit during turbulent times for the travel industry,
   with oil volatility, ongoing Brexit uncertainty and – as the result of
   ordered Boeing 737 MAX aircraft being unavailable during its grounding
   – capacity concerns for next summer’s schedules.

   The European package tour has been an iconic option for decades. Seven
   nights with the family in a bucket-and-spade
   destination, lads-or-lasses holiday somewhere more lively or quiet
   pensioners' holidays in the sun to escape the depths of
   winter: northern Europeans have been heading south for sun in droves
   for nearly 70 years. Reform of the way non-scheduled airlines – in
   other words, charter operators like Thomas Cook – were regulated in the
   mid-1950s led to a boom in sunseekers everywhere from Helsinki to
   Hartlepool travelling to sunnier climes.

What has changed for package holidays?

   The wide availability of the Internet starting in the early 2000s drove
   several changes to the fundamental structure of the industry, just as
   the lustre was starting to wear off the popularity of the package
   holiday after the status-symbol-driven 1980s and 1990s.

   For a start, the low-cost carrier boom that had started in the
   mid-1990s went digital. Airlines including Ryanair and easyJet, broke
   the binary: you no longer had to choose between a scheduled airline
   like British Airways or Air France or a package tour operator like
   Britannia or Monarch. They also prompted established carriers to cut
   costs and offer cheaper packages of their own, either directly or
   through subsidiaries like Finnair’s Aurinkomatkat tour operator.

   The digital revolution also enabled companies other than the
   traditional tour operators to thrive – the dotcoms that started to
   dominate (and still do in many areas), started offering package tours
   in conjunction with a low-cost airline. Your author remembers a
   delightful snowy January package booking from London to Venice (via
   Treviso) flying Ryanair and staying at a local pensione
   bed-and-breakfast; this change to the entire way the model works rather
   took the traditional tour operators by surprise.

Are travellers still going on package holidays?

   The package holiday was and is still big business. Touring the airport
   at Gran Canaria earlier this year, airport management told me that
   their working assumption based on the number of tour buses using the
   airport is that some two fifths of travellers using the airport are
   still arriving part of a package holiday to the many resorts around the
   island.

   This is underscored by the fact that priority at pick-up and drop-off
   is given to the many brightly branded coaches collecting up to fifty
   passengers at a time: the parking lane directly next to the terminal is
   for buses, not car drop-off, and an impressive corkscrew brings these
   coaches directly down to the arrivals parking area to pick up the next
   load. Indeed, anyone driving into the tourist centre of Maspalomas on
   Gran Canaria will probably drive along the Avenida Touroperador Tui — a
   sign of both the historic and ongoing importance of these companies to
   the island.

   With a trend towards more specialised, intergenerational and group
   travel, and particularly since the rise of Airbnb and its competitors
   in the last decade, travellers are more used to booking their own
   accommodation and flights separately. But, within the EU and especially
   from the UK with its ATOL booking protection for package holidays, will
   the high-profile collapse of Monarch and now Thomas Cook affect the
   number of passengers booking packages?

   taken on 23 September shows the cancelled flights of the Thomas Cook
   airlines at the Larnaca International Airport © IAKOVOS HATZISTAVROU /

What is the future of package holidays?

   It seems certain that there is still a role for package holidays in the
   travel of the future, but perhaps not as we know them. As much as there
   is a clear trend towards authentic experiences for many travellers,
   there’s a competing trend where sometimes it’s just nice to have
   everything done for you on a trip, especially for those of us who are
   the unofficial family travel agents.

   Moreover, Airbnb has been something of a victim of its own success:
   there is backlash from communities turning into largely unregulated
   tourist hotspots and, anecdotally at least, there seems to be
   an unpleasant trend of late cancellations by hosts, leaving travellers
   in the lurch.

   If I had to look into a crystal ball, though, I’d predict that the
   remaining tour operators will become more nimble and specialised. It
   strikes me that there is little innovation in, say, package tourism
   friendly to the LGBTQIA+ market, Muslim families who require privacy
   for hijab-free holidays, and to the ever-growing
   premium-but-cost-conscious retiree travel market.

   Nor are there many options for larger accommodation suitable for
   intergenerational travel: separate bedrooms for granny and grandpa with
   fully accessible showers, and enough flexibility for extended family to
   be connected via adjoining doors between multiple single units, for
   example.

   they chat next to a wall. Two workers of British travel group Thomas
   Cook speak at Son Sant Joan airport in Palma de Mallorca © JAIME REINA

   So raise a glass to Thomas Cook and its successors, and spare a thought
   for the many thousands of dedicated and hardworking employees who find
   themselves facing uncertainty about their jobs, as well as the
   travellers whose holidays are ending in stress or in jeopardy.

What happens if you don’t put your phone on airplane mode on a flight?

It’s not that long ago that airlines stopped telling passengers to keep their
mobile phones, tablets, e-readers and other devices turned off throughout the
flight. Remember the time in 2011 when Alec Baldwin was kicked off an
American Airlines plane after becoming disruptive when a flight attendant
told him to stop playing Words with Friends? Airlines take this stuff
seriously for a reason.

   Images

Why do we have to put our phones on flight mode?

   We’re asked to turn our devices off or to flight mode because of
   electromagnetic interference from phones, tablets, e-readers,
   electronic headsets, and more. Since some planes were built before
   these became a thing, it took a while for the industry to make sure it
   was entirely safe to use them.

   These days, you’ll even see iPads and other tablets in the flight deck,
   which pilots use to store paperwork instead of lugging around big bags
   with actual paper in. You’ll see flight attendants using tablets and
   big phones too, either instead of or in addition to those reams and
   reams of dot-matrix printed paperwork. All those devices have been
   tested extensively to make sure there’s no interference.

   How to get the most out of your devices while travelling

   But that hasn’t always been the case! In fact, back in 2011, some parts
   within specific models of flight deck screen on certain Boeing 737
   aircraft proved to be susceptible to interference. How’d we find out
   that specific combination of planes and monitors — and fix it? During
   the rigorous testing process to enable airlines to offer inflight
   internet, that’s how. Part of that testing process is creating enough
   electromagnetic interference to represent an entire cabin full of
   devices of a variety of sizes, including some that are malfunctioning.
   Pretty much every airliner-equipment combo operated by a major
   international airline has now been tested.

   airport mode" © Getty Image

What happens if I don't put my phone on airplane mode?

   For years, safety regulators, airlines, aircraft manufacturers and
   everyone else in the industry has known that there are dozens of
   devices left out of airplane mode on every flight. In a way, the fact
   that planes haven’t fallen out of the sky willy-nilly because someone
   left their Kindle on is the best demonstration that, for the most part,
   most devices don’t affect most planes.

   But most isn’t good enough for aviation. Some folks don’t know that
   their Kindle even has 3G, or that the Bluetooth on their
   watch/headphones/other device counts as needing to be in airplane mode.
   Some forget that they’ve packed one of those devices in the overhead
   bin. Some even blatantly ignore the rules, assuming that their vital
   email on that BlackBerry isn’t going to make their plane start to
   plummet. And it probably isn’t.

   Just how fresh is the food served in your airline meal?

   Here’s the thing: aviation doesn’t work on probablys. One of the
   reasons why aviation is safer than getting in your car, crossing the
   street, or even just staying at home (more people are casualties of
   toilet-related incidents than aviation accidents!) is that airlines and
   their regulators work with an abundance of caution.

   interference from phones and tablets © Getty Images
