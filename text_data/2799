lyrics

   You make me happy
   Happier than I’ve ever known
   To be next to you
   You feel like home
   When you’re smiling at me
   My heart skips a beat
   ‘Cause you’re so sweet
   While you hold my hand
   That way you’re looking at me
   You melt my heart
   Sweep me off my feet
   You make me happy
   So happy
   Lying in your arms
   I feel safe and warm
   What a dream come true
   To be here with you

       haliniak)”
       This is one of the best shoegaze albums I have heard this year, it
       kind've coincided with DEAFCULT's release of Auras, so I don't want
       it to be eclipsed. I want this on vinyl! If there is any physical
       format to this amazing LP, I need to find it! Thank you for this
       musical gift! Charlie Mayer
