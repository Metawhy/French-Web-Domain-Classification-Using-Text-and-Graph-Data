     * A night to remember! ✨🥂 . Over the weekend, we attended our first
       @dinerenblanchon. A night filled with ambrosial food, classy
       champagne, and awesome people all around! There were a plethora of
       eye-catching picnic setups, entertainment, and everyone having a
       grand time during a torrential downpour + flash flood warning. Rain
       or shine, it’s up to you to make the best of it and everyone did
       just that! It was amazing to see people of all ages embrace the
       present moment with delight and drunken happiness. 😆 . Le Dîner en
       Blanc is a worldwide annual event which began in Paris in 1988 and
       has grown over the years to six continents and over 70 cities. The
       location is kept secret until the day of the gathering. Everyone
       must wear all white from head to toe and bring all white chairs,
       table, decor, utensils, napkins, food, drinks, and everything else
       you bring to an outdoor (upscale) BYOD picnic! After buses drop you
       off at the location, you set everything up and dine under the stars
       while watching the entertainment. After dinner, the dance floor
       opens up for everyone to dance the night away! . Mahalo to Crystal
       and Chantel @crystalclearhi for inviting us and @alohilaniresort
       team for the amazing company all night! . Haircut and color by the
       hair goddess @hairbyjuju @jvsalon 💇‍♀️🖤 #jvhairangels . #debhnl
