     NEW E2B FEATURES!

     UEFI-multiboot - Add a second FAT32 partition containing WinPE for
     UEFI-only systems (see here for details).
     E2B now does not require a WinHelper USB flash drive to be added
     when booting most Windows Install ISOs from an E2B USB Hard Disk and
     you can boot Windows Install 7/8/10 ISOs from any menu folder.

     Extension override suffix and file sort order prefix supported (e.g.
     _039_Ubuntu v13.1 x64._iso64.iso) so you can arrange the menu items
     in any order without needing to create a .txt file for each .ISO
     file.

     Use the .imgPTNX4 file extension to replace partition 4 with a WinPE
     partition image file (see here for details).

   Latest Beta versions (with bugfixes, new features, etc.) are on
   the Alternate Download sites and check my blog for the latest news.

   Free help! - A Live Help pop-up icon is often available on this site to
   start a live chat session with the developer for any problems that you
   cannot solve by using the Site Map (you must enable pop-ups in your
   browser to see the Live Help pop-up if using FireFox).

     Note: eBook #1 includes instructions on how to remove the ASCII-text
     blue and white banner startup screen.

Want to boot almost ANYTHING from just one USB drive?

   Then why not use what the 'Techies' use?
     * The Easy2Boot Menu system uses grub4dos+scripts. Licensed and free
       s/w is included in the download.
     * Easy to maintain - just copy over your ISO files/.imgPTN
       files/other files (or delete them from the USB drive) - a new menu
       is automatically created each time you boot from the E2B USB drive.
     * No need to reformat your E2B USB drive ever again, even if you want
       to update it with the latest version of E2B.
     * Directly MBR-boot from the USB drive to unmodified files: .ISO,
       .IMA, .IMG, .VHD, .VHDX, .WIM, WinBuilder WinPE ISOs, Windows
       Install ISOs, Linux ISOs, FreeDOS, Hirens ISOs, MemTest86,
       diagnostics, repair software, Anti-Virus cleaners, etc. etc. etc.
       The file extension determines how E2B will boot from it. E2B
       recognises many additional 'special' file extensions.
     * Adding new payloads is fast! Copying one large ISO file to a USB
       drive is much quicker than extracting hundreds of smaller files
       from the ISO. Also it is much easier to backup and delete one file
       when you no longer want it.
     * The E2B download is a Windows self-extracting .exe executable (a
       .zip file is provided for linux users) which allows you to make an
       NTFS multiboot USB drive with just a few mouse clicks. You can
       also Make an E2B USB drive using linux using a bash shell script
       (provided in download).
     * You can add your own files, applications, portable apps, etc.
     * UEFI-booting (incl. Secure Boot) is made possible by converting
       UEFI-bootable payloads (ISOs, disk images, flash drives, etc.)
       into .imgPTN files (partition images). Use the MPI Tool Pack to
       make .imgPTN files for MBR+UEFI booting (supports Secure Boot).
       Adding a second FAT32 partition will allow you to Secure UEFI-boot
       to UEFI images without needing to MBR-boot (see here).
     * Over 340 different types of ISOs and payload files supported.
     * USB Flash drives (and USB HDD\SSD drives with some workarounds) are
       supported (NTFS is recommended).
     * E2B is designed to work on a wide variety of different PCs and
       Notebooks, even those with buggy/quirky BIOSes.
     * Generic - unlike other solutions, there is no need to update E2B
       when a new linux distro is released
     * Multiple linux ISOs+Persistence possible (via .mnu menu files) -
       persistence files larger than 4GB are supported.
     * Add images of other single- or dual-partition bootable USB drives
       (e.g. add partition images of Rufus, WinsetupFromUSB, YUMI, XBOOT,
       DOS USB, etc.).
     * 15+ languages for the E2B menu system. Press F1 in the E2B Menu for
       help.
     * Use E2B for unattended Windows installs (drivers+apps+updates using
       an unmodified Microsoft Windows Install ISO file) by using
       the SDI_CHOCO feature - when a new version of Windows is released,
       simply copy on the new Windows ISO!
     * Fully configurable - it is easy to change the menu text, menu
       order, menu defaults, timeouts, background wallpaper, add your own
       grub4dos menu files, add your own sub-menus, configure the menu
       with the E2B_Editor GUI Windows app., load different themes\skins
       and much more...
     * YouTube videos, free live help and support + eBooks.

Are you new to Easy2Boot?

   A new USB multiboot solution (Legacy+UEFI). Just copy the ISO files to
   the USB drive and boot.
   For UEFI-booting you must convert ISOs to .imgPTN files first.

   Each time you boot, the E2B scripts automatically find all the payload
   files (.ISO, .IMA, .BIN, .IMG, etc.) on the USB drive and dynamically
   generate the menus. Each file is run depending on its file extension.
     * Watch the v ideos, then use the Tabs at the side of this website.
     * E2B eBooks with Exercises to follow here.
     * Start with the 'Make a USB drive' page, then go to the 'Add Payload
       Files' page.
     * Always use the Site Map to find what you want.
     * 'Create Multi Windows USB Installer' YouTube video by
       Britec here (old method).
     * E2B demo preview YouTube video by Alvaro (includes UEFI demo here).
     * You can find a list of Easy2Boot Tutorials on my blog page

Easy to maintain, delete or update

   How to add all your ISO (and other) files:
    1. Copy each bootable ISO/payload file into a suitable menu folder on
       the E2B USB drive (e.g. \_ISO\WINDOWS\WIN10 or \_ISO\LINUX) - no
       extra applications required.
    2. Make all files contiguous (if required), e.g. double-click on
       \Make_This_Drive_Contiguous.cmd on the USB drive (or run the
       linux defragfs or udefrag command from \_ISO\docs\linux_utils
       folder). Not all files need to be contiguous so try it anyway - it
       may still work! See here for more info.
    3. Boot to the E2B menu and pick your ISO or payload file from the
       appropriate menu.
    4. To remove an ISO file, just delete it from the E2B drive.

   To make a copy of your E2B drive onto another USB drive, run
   \MAKE_E2B_USB_DRIVE (run as admin).cmd from the USB drive that you want
   to copy from.

Real comments from real users

     * E2B is incredibly easy to setup and has worked with literally no
       issues. **Possibly the best free product I have ever used in
       IT. (reddit)
     * I haven't looked at YUMI in a few years, but the difference in
       features/compatibility was like night and day once I started using
       Easy2Boot (reddit).
     * Easy2Boot is black magic and I don't think I could use another
       mul tiple iso boot solution after getting used to how easy it is
       (reddit)
     * Have you tried "easy2boot?" One drive is all you need to boot any
       OS or ISO file directly. It's almost magick (reddit)
     * Easy2Boot is indeed a master piece. I have tried them all but none
       is close enough to Easy2boot. (see comments)
     * Easy2Boot has become my go to multi-boot tool of choice and the
       first tool I pack in with my geek goodies, hopefully it can suit
       your needs too (Arrogant Geek article)
     * 'Easy2Boot is one of those incredibly useful tools that once you
       use it, you can’t imagine living without it.' - Gary Danton's E2B
       installation guide.
     * 'I have tried YUMI, Sardu and others, this one just does it
       all.' (see comments)
     * 'In short, Easy2Boot is by-far the best USB drive creation
       tool/utility out there'
     * 'This is one tool that every techie should have!'
     * 'Really, seriously, and truly, just use Easy2Boot.'
     * 'I wish I had this utility years ago. RMPrepUSB and Easy2Boot have
       changed the way I do my job. Other solutions gave me problems.
       Easy2Boot is the first fully-working solution !
     * 'E2B wins hands down no question. Can't find anything else that can
       handle that many ISO's'
     * Went to YouTube and started with Steve's latest tutorials. Wow, I
       was soon cooking just after the first one, but the latest three
       tutorials have shown me virtually everything I need for my
       purposes. Fantastic app., really love the QEMU emulator which lets
       me test without rebooting. Also like the diagnostics and
       backup/restore functions. No offense to the apps. I deleted (Sardu,
       Yumi, XBoot); but for me, RMPrepusb/Easy2Boot is the answer to my
       needs.

     * You can make a E2B drive using a Windows or linux system (not Mac).
     * Easy2Boot is a collection of grub4dos scripts which you copy to a
       grub4dos-bootable USB drive - open-source code (grub4dos, etc.) +
       plain text scripts.
     * Easy2Boot uses Open Source grub4dos utilities and plain-text
       scripts (E2B IS NOT A WINDOWS UTILITY)
     * Easy2Boot (E2B) supports both USB Flash and USB HDD drives (FAT32,
       NTFS, exFAT, ext2/3/4)
     * Because Easy2Boot is not a 'utility', you can prepare an Easy2Boot
       drive under Windows or linux. Once prepared, just copy over (or
       delete) any ISOs you like, at any time in the future.
     * Extensive list of 100's of tested ISOs and payloads here - 99% of
       all linux ISOs will 'just work' by copying over the ISO file!
     * To remove a payload, just delete the payload file!
     * No limit to the number of different Linux, Windows Install, WinPE,
       etc. ISOs or other payload files
     * Easy to update to the latest version - just overwrite the E2B files
       on your USB drive with the latest version.
     * You will need a Windows system to make .imgPTN files (for
       UEFI-booting and other purposes).
     * Just add Windows (NT6) .VHD, .VHDX and .WIM files and boot! No BCD
       needed.
     * Multiple UEFI multi-booting of linux, Windows Installers, KonBoot,
       etc. from partition images (see YouTube video)
     * Boot  Windows, WinBuilder PE, MSDaRT, linux and many others
       directly from ISO files (in MBR/BIOS mode)
     * Add images of all your other bootable USB Flash drives to E2B (e.g.
       add images of USB drives made with Rufus, XBOOT, SARDU, YUMI, Live
       USB drives, etc.). The .imgPTN image file is only as large as the
       files on the drive that you are imaging.
     * Boot multiple versions of the Hirens Boot CDs with all
       features working (DOS, linux, MiniWindows)  + multiple HP Utilities
       and many others.
     * Boot to 32-bit and 64-bit UEFI mode directly from MBR mode using
       Clover (YouTube video)
     * UEFI Secure Boot supported
     * Boot multiple WindowsToGo and fully-installed linux OSs all from
       one partition
     * Compatible with Zalman/IODD USB-HDD CD emulator (boot ISOs from the
       Zalman or boot to E2B menu)
     * English, Chinese, Dutch, Swedish, Spanish, French, Italian, Polish,
       Portuguese, Romanian, Russian and German language options (so
       far...)
     * Design your own menu theme using the free E2B_Editor.exe Windows
       GUI
     * Automate Windows installs direct from an unaltered Windows ISO file
       with drivers, Windows updates and applications (SDI_Choco)
     * No need to re-partition or re-format your existing grub4dos USB
       drive (though I recommend you do for maximum compatibility with
       different systems).
     * For most ISOs just 'Drag-and-Drop' - copy your ISO file directly
       onto your E2B USB drive (MBR\CSM booting only) and boot!
     * UEFI+CSM booting of Windows Installers and Linux LiveCD payloads
       via a partition image (and most other UEFI-enabled payloads too,
       such as KonBoot).
     * Can use a USB Hard disk with one or more partitions and still UEFI
       boot (even if they are all NTFS partitions) - no complex GPT
       partitions needed.
     * Boot almost ANY type of linux 'LiveCD' ISO - just copy it over!
       Unlike XBOOT or YUMI, you don't have to wait for Easy2Boot to be
       updated to support a new linux ISO distro - Easy2Boot is generic.
       See 'How it works'.
     * Boot to any UEFI (Intel CPU) payload directly from the grub4dos
       menu without needing to reboot the system (via Clover).
     * UEFI boot to an NTFS partition (via Clover + first FAT32 ptn).
     * Supports Partition Image booting - make image files of any
       existing, bootable single-partition FAT32 or NTFS USB stick and add
       the files to E2B (e.g. add images of USB Flash drives made with
       YUMI, XBOOT, SARDU, WinSetupFromUSB, LiveUSB Creator, Rufus, USB
       Universal Installer, MSDaRT, Windows AIO installers, HP Utilities,
       etc.). Also supports dual partition images - e.g. FAT32 + NTFS.
     * Install Windows XP to a system from UNMODIFIED 32-bit XP install
       ISOs (any number of different ISOs) to a IDE\SATA\AHCI\RAID\SCSI
       system - no need to integrate special mass-storage or F6 drivers!
       Also works with Server 2003 ISOs (can be automated using answer
       file).
     * Install directly from any number of different Windows
       Vista/7/8/SVR2008R2/SVR2012/Win10 install ISO files (can be fully
       automated using an XML answer file).
     * Boot directly from linux LiveCD ISOs with persistence - you can
       have all  these (and more) on one Easy2Boot drive and boot them
       all with persistence - YLMF, Ubuntu, Fedora, StartOS, Porteus,
       pclinuxos, Backtrack5, kali-linux, Mint ISOs and more. e.g. you can
       even boot from the same linux ISO but have 2 or more persistence
       files for the same ISO, one for each different user. Persistence
       files can be larger than 4GB (if you format the E2B drive as NTFS).
     * User configurable and fully documented - you can change the
       background wallpaper, headings and text colours, move the menu
       position, make your own sub-menus, make it beep when the menu
       loads, add your own GFXBoot menu, change menu font, use UTF-8
       non-ASCII characters in the menus, define your own hotkeys, add
       your own language versions, etc. etc.
     * Variety of example 'skins'/themes included.
     * Compatible with FlashBoot (for booting old systems that have
       trouble booting from USB due to non-standard USB BIOS boot
