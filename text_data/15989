EraseRestart, 19th issue:
Eating Disorders

   Sieh dir diesen Beitrag auf Instagram an

   EraseRestart, 19th issue: Eating Disorders 💜 . I never quite felt
   comfortable with my weight and what I saw in the mirror. When I was 19
   years old, I became obsessed with weighing myself and trying to “score”
   lower. For me, it started after a back injury I had at the drama
   school. I thought that the thinner I became, the easier the doctor
   would access my vertebrae during therapy, the faster I’d get out of
   bed. But even after my back got better, I kept up with my new,
   unhealthy eating habits. There would be days I wouldn’t even drink
   water. I reached 38 kgs. Luckily – and with the help of my family, I
   managed to get out of that spiral… but then the hormonal issues kicked
   in, leading to weight gain, mostly due to fluid retention… I would
   starve myself all day but would still gain grams, kilos. Going from the
   “you should eat something” to the “you’re not so light anymore huh?
   You’ve gained so much weight” – having people almost constantly
   commenting on my weight, both at the drama school and in my band
   surrounding, I felt ugly and useless. Even though my hormone levels
   balanced out within a year or so – whether I was on the thinner or the
   fuller end, I never truly managed to embrace myself. So this issue is
   personal – yet filled with valuable (and hopefully helpful)
   information. If you’re struggling with an eating disorder, please do
   seek out for help. I know first hand that it never truly goes away, but
   it can get better – that I can promise. Thank you for stopping by – SP
   💜💜 PS. What helped me get better and re-develop a healthy relationship
   with food was cooking. I would find the most complex, the most
   difficult recipes – those that required hard-to-find ingredients and
   took ages to prepare. Through enjoying the process, I would slowly
   start enjoying tasting my creations, too. It took a long time, but
   that’s what worked out for me – shout-out to Nigel Slater for having
   some of the most creative and delicate recipes. – S. x . . .

EraseRestart, 18th issue:
Self Care

   Sieh dir diesen Beitrag auf Instagram an

   EraseRestart, 18th issue: Self Care 🌸 . Hi everyone! EraseRestart is
   back with an issue dedicated to self care. It took me many years to
   accept that practicing self care doesn’t mean being selfish. While I’d
   go around and preach to the people around me “take some time off,
   respect your limits”, I would constantly cross mine, oftentimes,
   leaving me completely floored. I wouldn’t say I’ve now mastered the art
   of self care, but I’ve most certainly become better at it. Self care is
   an ancient concept that’s somehow misunderstood, in today’s world. It
   isn’t a luxury, but a necessity. It’s absolutely VITAL to practice self
   care, in order to maintain good health. I encourage you all to
   consciously take a break, think of your needs and make a plan to
   fulfill them. Happy scrolling and happy relaxing. SP 🌝💕✨ . PS: This is
   the issue I published last month and then deleted it because it barely
   showed to people. I’ve had some troubles with IG and its algorithm –
   apparently it doesn’t ~love~ the EraseRestart format. But as I’m
   looking for alternative platforms (already working on an event here in
   Athens ✨✨), I decided to re-upload this issue because truly, simply –
   self care matters and also we can’t let those bits & bytes mess with
   our projects and passions. A HUGE THANK YOU to all those people sending
   me sweet and encouraging notes last month about EraseRestart. Lots of
   love to you all 💕💕💕✨✨

EraseRestart, 17th issue:
Bipolar Disorder

   Sieh dir diesen Beitrag auf Instagram an

   EraseRestart, 17th issue: Bipolar Disorder 🎭 . [REPOSTING BC SOME OF
   THE PAGES TURNED BLANK 😬🖤] . Hi there! This month’s issue will be
   looking into bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder is one of the most
   stigmatised mental illnesses. Perhaps, that’s because of the
   unrealistic portrayal of bipolar disorder in arts and culture – those
   struggling with it are often presented as mad criminals,
   (self-)destructive people who can’t separate reason from emotion.
   Unfortunately, stigma spreads fast, leading to people living with
   bipolar disorder left without a support system and/or ways to handle
   and treat their illness. EraseRestart means education and that’s what
   this and all issues are about. For this issue in particular, I decided
   to make it less visual and more factual – something that may not agree
   with Instagram’s algorithm. Regardless, I’d like to start a
   conversation about what we can do to make it better for those
   struggling. How can we improve our understanding of (in this case)
   bipolar disorder and help those around us? I was recently told by a
   friend that it’s probably about time to change the cover and the style
   of EraseRestart – but EraseRestart is hardly about aesthetics. It’s
   about learning more about mental health, educating ourselves (myself
   included, of course). It’s about erasing stigma and restarting with
   more understanding and kindness for those struggling. There’s nothing
   glamorous and/or aesthetically pleasing about mental health. There’s
   nothing mystifying about it and frankly, for a generation that claims
   to break the stereotypes (and does so well, so often), we still have a
   long way to go in understanding that achieving good mental health means
   facing mental illness. For real, though. I hope you’ll find this issue
   informative and helpful. Until next month – thank you for stopping by,
   SP 🌝✨✨ . . . . #bipolardisorder #bipolardisorderawareness

EraseRestart, 16th issue:
Awareness

   Sieh dir diesen Beitrag auf Instagram an

   EraseRestart 16th issue: Awareness 👁👁 . Hi everyone! The 16th issue of
   EraseRestart is here to look into awareness. Everyone is raising
   awareness about something these days, but why? What is a mental health
   advocate? Since 1949, Mental Health America has established Mental
   Health (Awareness) Month, observed every year in May all across the
   United States (and beyond, thanks to new technologies). We have
   definitely moved forward since the late 40s/early 50s, when this action
   was first initiated. We’re definitely more aware and sensitive about
   social issues that tantalise our communities. People are keen on
   talking more and louder about mental health these days. We speak about
   it, but do we listen? Part of raising awareness is educating ourselves.
   What is mental illness? What are the mental health disorders? How can
   we achieve productive advocacy and help destigmatise mental illness?
   Starting from somewhere, we can take cues from Mental Health America
   and be inspired by their commitment and resilience. Mental health is
   part of the bigger conversation about public health – something that
   should matter to all. We must keep listening, learning, talking about
   it and taking action. For a more inclusive world. Thank you for
   stopping by, SP 🌝💚

EraseRestart, 15th issue:
Depression

   Sieh dir diesen Beitrag auf Instagram an

   EraseRestart 15th issue: Depression 🥀 . Hi everyone! This issue will be
   looking into depression – one of the most common illnesses. According
   to World Health Organization, 300 million people around the world have
   depression which makes it the leading cause of disability worldwide. It
   can affect anyone; that’s why it’s important to educate ourselves on
   what it is, what could the symptoms and the risk factors be and how to
   treat it. In regards to the cure of depression, although we have the
   tools, unfortunately, many patients remain untreated. That may be due
   to the lack of resources (reduced funds, too few trained mental health
   professionals, too few mental health care facilities), limited to no
   accessibility to receive treatment (high costs, not many options for
   remote communities/rural areas), the social stigma that
   (unnecessarily)surrounds mental health… The message EraseRestart wants
   to send with this issue is that no matter the case and the
   circumstances, if you need help, please reach out to your closest ones
   and/or your national/local crisis lines. Depression is a serious
   illness and needs to/can be treated. Always remember, we’re together in
   this – talking about mental health. Thank you for stopping by, SP 🌝 ✨

   you know, today we celebrate International Women’s Day. Inspired by
   this year’s #balanceforbetter campaign, this EraseRestart is dedicated
   to the women who came before us and worked hard to break the stigma
   that surrounds mental health, the women who are achieving great things
   the now and the children of the future as then, hopefully, gender won’t
   be used to discriminate, indicate “superiority” and/or keep one away
   from reaching their full potential. Happy International Women’s Day and

   EraseRestart, 13th issue: 1 Year of Talking About It 💚 . Hi friends!
   This EraseRestart issue is rather celebratory. A year ago, I decided to
   start publishing EraseRestart and commence a conversation on here
   around mental health. Every month, I dedicated time to educate myself
   on mental health and learn about the latest studies and their findings.
   Through this platform, I was given the chance to connect with lots of
   activists, people who want to follow a similar path or simply felt
   connected to the topic of breaking the stigma that surrounds mental
   health. I’m eternally grateful to all the people who stopped by and
   scrolled through EraseRestart. I’m oh-so-thankful to those who listened
   and became more mindful in their everyday lives. EraseRestart is here
   and will keep being published, in the hope of building bridges within
   our societies. For more understanding and kindness, as I always like to
   say. Thank you all for your time and for showing love to this project.
   Sky is the limit, so here we come! Happy scrolling and happy first year
   anniversary to EraseRestart! SP 🌝✨

EraseRestart, 12th issue:
In Literature

   Sieh dir diesen Beitrag auf Instagram an

   EraseRestart, 12th issue: In Literature 📚 . Hi everyone! The 12th issue
   of EraseRestart is about classic books that touch on mental illness. In
   Mrs Dalloway, Virginia Woolf’s character Septimus Warren Smith, a WWI
   veteran, struggles with post-traumatic stress and depression. Virginia
   Woolf possibly drew inspiration from her struggles with her own mental
   health; the character is written in a truthful, representational
   manner. In Hamlet, William Shakespeare explores madness, depression and
   suicide with great sensitivity. Especially Ophelia’s character is
   written in a very humane and respectful way. In The Bell Jar, Esther
   Greenwood is an almost autobiographical character for Sylvia Plath – a
   young woman who’s struggling with clinical depression and suicide
   ideation, experiencing life at a mental institution in the 50s. Lastly,
   in The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger, Holden Caulfield – the
   protagonist of the book, may not necessarily struggle with mental
   illness – the character’s mental state has been debated over the years.
   That said, Holden is surely suffering by Weltschmerz and is tormented
   by existentialism. In your opinion, which book depicts mental illness
   in a genuine way? Which book has brought you closer to understanding
   own or your loved ones’ struggles? Feel free to let me know in the
   comments or through DMs. Happy scrolling and thank you for stopping by,
   SP 🌝✨

   EraseRestart, 11th issue: Through Songs 💛 . Hi all! Do you have a song
   that you put on when you’re feeling blue? Do you have a song that lifts
   you up? Music is powerful! Not only it’s got a biological effect on us
   (can help reduce heart rate, can help increase serotonin levels etc),
   but it’s also helping us connect with each other and become more
   social. It’s been reported that music therapy was used for healing
   purposes in Ancient Egypt & Ancient Greece. It’s proven by studies that
   music therapy improves the lives of those struggling with
   schizophrenia. Music has also been helping individuals cope with their
   depression and anxiety. I’d like to hear from you – your favorite
   songs, lyrics that helped you through tough times. I’d also like to
   invite you to care for yourselves this weekend and take it slow. I
   compiled a Spotify playlist titled “Self-Care/EraseRestart” with some
   super sweet tunes released in 2018 – candy for your ears! Happy
   scrolling and happy listening 🎧, SP 🌝✨

   EraseRestart, 10th issue: On Screen ? . Hi all! The 10th issue of
   EraseRestart is a bit different. It comes with film and series
   recommendations – films and series that shed some light into dealing
   with mental illness, whether yourself, or through a loved one. On our
   way to breaking the stigma, we should acknowledge creators who went
   against the mainstream, offensive (on screen) depiction of mental
   illness and showed us that struggling with a mental health issue
   doesn’t make a person less human or less in need for friendship and
   love. I’ve put together some of my own favorites but I’d love to hear
   yours – you can either leave me a comment or DM me films and series
   that lift you up after a tough day or that you found them honest and
   realistic in representing mental illness. Happy scrolling and happy
   screening ?, SP ?✨

Youth

   EraseRestart, 9th issue: Youth ? . Hi all! Today is
   #worldmentalhealthday and I think it’s most appropriate that the theme
   of this issue is the mental health of the youth. The numbers of poor
   mental health among children, adolescents and young adults are doubling
   from year to year. In the UK only recent studies proved that the
   average time for a child to be treated for a mental health problem is
   ten years, with the parents reporting deterioration of their child’s
   health within that time. But what happens to countries with even less
   funds (or no funds at all) to spend for the treatment of children and
   young people’s mental health? What happens to children traumatized by
   war and a painful journey to seek refuge in another country? We’re
   responsible for the youth and the generations to come – it’s about time
   that we realize that and we start taking actions. Erasing the stigma
   that surrounds mental health is one good, first step towards a
   healthier society. Then we can restart/reset/reboot. It shouldn’t be
   that hard; we didn’t do it for us – we HAVE TO do it for our children.
   We must empower and provide them with the right tools for the difficult
   years to come! Thank you for reading & happy (mindful) scrolling! More
   power to the youth ? . . #theworldneeds to empower its children

Women

   EraseRestart, 8th issue: Women ? . Hi all! The 8th issue of
   EraseRestart is dedicated to all women warriors out there who are
   battling mental illness like champions. Realizing that you’re facing a
   mental health challenge and fighting for it, being brave to talk about
   it and seek out for help – taking action. That’s so admirable! It’s
   proven that women are more likely to talk about their mental health,
   despite the stigma. For years, we’ve put up with the “mentally
   unstable” stereotype “due to hormones”, the “oh, it’s that time of the
   month” sexist comments… It’s time to erase the stigma/hypocrisy/gender
   bias from the talks about mental health. It’s time to restart the
   conversation on new grounds, teach the younger generations and the men
   in our lives the magic of lifting each other up. Fun fact: sisterhood –
   the major force that it is, is helping you heal. According to the
   @mentalhealthfoundation, “good social support can play a part in
   preventing ill mental health and can help people recover from mental
   health problems”. Food for thought and a good reason to be thankful
   today (and every day). Thank you for stopping by and for joining forces
   with me to break the stigma surrounding mental health??✨

EraseRestart, 7th issue:
Men

   EraseRestart, 7th issue: Men ? . Hi all! The 7th issue of EraseRestart
   is about men’s mental health. Men are less likely to talk about their
   mental health struggles and seek out for help. Due to the toxic
   stereotype of the man being seen as the provider in our societies, a
   mental illness is often seen and perceived as weakness both by the one
   struggling and his peers. LGBT+ men, as well as men who belong in
   racial/ethnic minorities appear to struggle the most because society is
   making it even harder for them from very early on in their lives. The
   high rates of male suicide worldwide prove that stigma and internalised
   pain are leading nowhere. If you need emotional support and/or are
   struggling with thoughts of suicide, seek out for help at your national
   suicide prevention line. Be healthy and thank you for stopping by, SP

EraseRestart, 6th issue:
Creative Industries

   EraseRestart, 6th issue: Creative Industries ? . Hi all! The 6th issue
   of EraseRestart is about mental health in the creative industries – and
   it’s a bit different, if you may! It’s meant to debunk the myth of the
   creative genius. That being said, a recent study in Northern Ireland
   found out that people working in the creative industries are three
   times more likely to suffer from mental health problems than the
   general public. From what I’ve seen in the places I’ve been, it’d be
   safe to say that this is not a problem that only people in Northern
   Ireland are facing. Insane deadlines, lots of competition, a derailing
   economy all over the world that requires creativity to survive, lack of
   security… the list is long! Not to mention that working in the creative
   industries means no day off and in many cases, even no sleep. I made
   this zine today to shed a light on the lives of many people that you
   might have in your surrounding. Let’s stop telling them that they
   should stress out less or that they should find a “real job”. Instead,
   we should lend them an ear and find out more about their vision and the
   exciting projects they’ve been working on! Thank you for reading and I
   hope you’ll enjoy this issue, SP ?✨

In Music

   EraseRestart, 5th issue: In Music ?? . Dear music fan, dear fellow
   artist, Music artists all over the world are being exploited on a daily
   basis. That leaves them with poor mental & physical health, debts and
   no hope for the future. It’s up to you and me to change that. We should
   all come together, united by our love for music. • Stop supporting
   management companies & labels who cash in on the backs of exhausted
   artists. • Boycott labels & publishers who promote quantity over
   quality. • Boycott events where performers are criminally underpaid –
   invited to play for “exposure”. • Lastly, turn your backs to clickbait
   publications and unethical journalists who see a story in someone
   else’s tragedy. We can bring a change, but only if we stick together.
   Power to the artists! ✊? Yours faithfully, Sarah P.

EraseRestart, 4th issue:
Talking About It With A Partner

   EraseRestart, 4th issue: Talking about it with a partner ? . Hi
   everyone! The fourth issue of @eraserestart is here, recommending
   playing with open cards when in a relationship. Similarly to the third
   issue (“Talking about it with friends & family”), it’d be safe to state
   that a romantic partner can play a positive role in the life of someone
   who’s struggling with their mental health. That being said, an
   unhealthy relationship can have the exact opposite effect and impact
   the lives and mental wellbeing of both people involved. Everyone comes
   with their own baggage, that’s why communication and understanding are
   essential when in a relationship. Due to the instability of our times
   and what we’ve been taught by older generations, we tend to always be
   in the lookout for something better – a better house, job, better
   friends, better partners. This attitude leads to a fear of commitment
   inextricably linked to the fear of missing out. Even when in a
   relationship, we might find ourselves questioning our choices – a
   frustration that we might project to our partner by sending them mixed
   signals of what we want. Being open about our anxieties and other
   struggles can only help to build relationships that are long-lasting
   and meaningful. What if we’re missing out on something important,
   exactly by striving for the perfect life? In all cases, perhaps we need
   to relearn how to talk to each other and redefine our idea of
   “trouble”. Perhaps, we all need to walk the line between knowing our
   limits and not being selfish when someone’s calling for help. Thank you
   for reading and I hope you’ll enjoy scrolling through this issue, SP ?✨

   loved one. Friends and family can play a positive role in the life of
   someone who’s struggling. That being said, one should know their limits

EraseRestart, 2nd issue:
At Work

   EraseRestart, 2nd issue: At work / There’s no shame in asking for help
   . Hi everyone! This is the second issue of EraseRestart. With my
   Instazine, I invite you all to erase the stigma around mental health &
   restart in our communities with more understanding and respect towards
   those affected by mental illness. As I wrote before, EraseRestart is
   made with love and is the result of personal struggles and history.
   This issue is focusing on work. A workplace doesn’t necessarily give us
   the chance to show who we really are. The high pressure of our times
   has led to people “burning out”, which is a not-so-terrifying word for
   depression. Yet, according to @statista, the “percentage of adults who
   would turn to a counseling center for help in case of burnout as of
   2017” is just 17%. This zine focuses on solutions rather than on
   problems – whether we’re talking about quick “mood pick-me-ups” or
   changes we should actively incorporate in our lives in order to be more
   inclusive and understanding towards the rest of the world. We all have
   a lot to learn so I encourage you to swipe through EraseRestart & start
   a conversation – talk with your friends & family, with your colleagues
   & managers. And remember – there’s no shame in asking for help! In
   fact, it’s the most courageous thing. It will all be ok, as long as we
   have each other’s back. Thank you for your time & wishing y’all a nice
   weekend. SP ?

   EraseRestart, 1st issue: When at home & when in worry ? . Hi all, as I
   mentioned previously, this marks the beginning of a series of actions
   that aim to raise awareness around mental health. Mental illness is a
   topic that’s been covered broadly in the recent years, but there’s a
   long way to go when it comes to breaking the stigma. This instazine is
   meant to focus on solutions. It’s made with love and is the result of
   personal struggles and history. Together with you, I want to erase the
   societal stigma and restart on new grounds, with profound understanding
   for all those affected by mental illness whether directly or
   indirectly. It would mean the world to me if you spent 1 minute swiping
   through EraseRestart. Ultimately grateful for your time, SP ?✨
