When performance evaluation and training tasks become easier

     * 1

Data Augmentation
       Add bleed-through, ink degradation, adaptive blur, holes and other
       defects on your document images and use them for performance
       evaluation or retraining
     * 2

Synthetic document images
       Create virtually unlimited amounts of different ground-truthed
       synthetic document images based on a small number of real images.
     * 3

Easy generation system
       Use the user interface or create your own C++ code to create
       synthetic data.

Data Augmentation

   Physical degradation due to ageing, storage conditions or poor quality
   of printing materials may be present on documents. DocCreator currently
   proposes seven degradation models : bleed-through, ink degradation,
   adaptive blur, holes, paper deformation, ...

Synthetic document images

   With DocCreator create synthetic documents and corresponding XML ground
   truth that mimic real ones. Images created with DocCreator have already
   been used in many DIAR contexts: text/background/image pixel
   classification; staff removal; and handwritten character recognition.
   See the list of scientific publications where DocCreactor has been
   used.
