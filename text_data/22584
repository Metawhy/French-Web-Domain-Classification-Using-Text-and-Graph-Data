Welcome to Glottolog 4.0

   Comprehensive reference information for the world's languages,
   especially the lesser known languages.

   Information about the different languages, dialects, and families of
   the world ('languoids') is available in the Languages and Families
   sections. The References section contains bibliographical information.
   You can query the bibliographical database by filtering the table view
   or using a complex query involving genealogical affiliation, document
   type, and macro-area.

Catalogue of languages and families

   Glottolog provides a comprehensive catalogue of the world's languages,
   language families and dialects. It assigns a unique and stable
   identifier (the Glottocode) to (in principle) all languoids, i.e. all
   families, languages, and dialects. Any variety that a linguist works on
   should eventually get its own entry. The languoids are organized via a
   genealogical classification (the Glottolog tree) that is based on
   available historical-comparative research (see also the Languoids
   information section).

Bibliography

   The References section ('langdoc') provides a comprehensive collection
   of bibliographical data for the world's lesser known languages. It
   provides access to more than 180,000 references of descriptive works
   such as grammars, dictionaries, word lists, texts etc. Search criteria
   include author, year, title, country, and genealogical affiliation.
   References can be downloaded as txt, bib, html, or with the Zotero
   Firefox plugin.

   Glottolog will be continuously expanded and improved with the help of
   their users. The input of expert linguists is crucial.
