   “Totally Romantic! We decided to spend our 40th Anniversary at the ”
   Elk Cove Inn & Spa “, in Elk CA. It was a tropical paradise ! The
   flowers all around were so beautiful, you could hear the crashing waves
   from your room. We had a ocean view room and the sunsets were Awesome.
   To top that off everything you ever wanted or needed was in your room:
   ice box, microwave, Keurig coffee maker, coffee pods, silverware,
   glasses, can opener, salt & pepper. There was a special goodie basket
   waiting for us on our bed with grapes, cookies, microwave popcorn and
   wine, There was an electric fireplace in the room and a smaller one
   also,the bathroom was huge, with a shower and jetted tub … The
   breakfast buffet was to die for, so delicious. In the evening they had
   crackers, celery, spread and different wines.There is so much more…. We
   cant wait to come back!!” – TT, Granite Bay, Trip Advisor

Welcome to Elk Cove Inn … since 1968

   It’s all yours. One of the most spectacular views on the Mendocino
   coast. Nestled in peaceful seclusion atop a bluff overlooking a mile of
   dramatic beachfront, the Elk Cove Inn’s Craftsman-style Mansion was
   built in 1883 by the L.E. White Lumber Co. as the Mill Superintendent’s
   home. It became one of the first bed & breakfast inns on the Mendocino
   Coast in 1968. The inn is set back from the road, surrounded by native
   trees, a creek and the ocean, with private stairs to the
   driftwood-strewn beach below.

   Watch migrating whales and otters at play just steps from your room or
   from the inn’s signature gazebo. Or descend the inn’s private stairs to
   stroll on the beach. Relax in the hands of the North Coast’s finest,
   professional therapists at our European-style Day Spa. Day or night,
   there is simply no better spot to relax and reconnect. Local shops and
   restaurants are within easy walking distance. Historic Mendocino
   village, fabulous Anderson Valley wineries, lighthouses and dramatic
   redwood forests are just a short drive away.

   THE ELK COAST is comprised of four coastal hamlets: North Greenwood,
   Elk and Manchester. Adding to its splendor is the Stornetta Lands
   National Monument, 25 minutes south of Elk Cove Inn.
