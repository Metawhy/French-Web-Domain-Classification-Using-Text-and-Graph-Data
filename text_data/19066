Bachelors degree

   A bachelors degree is an academic degree usually awarded after
   completing coursework in a specific field of study. It usually takes
   between 3 and 5 years to earn a bachelors degree. Bachelors degree
   candidates are required to have high school or high school equivalent
   education and are awarded a Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts
   degree.

BA

   A Bachelor of Arts degree is awarded after completion of undergraduate
   study of a field in liberal arts, such as humanities, philosophy,
   social sciences and sometimes fine arts. Also abbreviated B.A., a
   Bachelor of Arts degree usually takes three to four years to complete.
   A BA opens professional doors to a wide variety of career paths, and is
   a pre-requisite for continued higher education.

BSc

   A Bachelor of Science, also known as a BSc or B.S., is an ideal
   undergraduate degree option for individuals interested in natural
   science, engineering, computer science, social science, mathematics and
   various other fields. A Bachelor of Science degree is a requirement for
   many career paths. Laying the groundwork for continued higher education
   or a career in a science- or engineering-related field, a BSc degree is
   a valuable investment.

BBA

   Bachelor of Business Administration is a four-year undergraduate degree
   that covers a number of fields within business administration and
   commerce. Also abbreviated BBA, this program then allows students to
   choose one or more areas of concentration, from Accounting to Strategic
   Management and more. BBA programs offer not only an ideal bedrock for a
   rewarding career in business administration, but also the core
   pre-requisites for continued business higher education.

Online Bachelor

   Online bachelor programs are designed for people who cannot become
   full-time students, whether it is due to family, work, or other
   commitments. With an online bachelor, students have the flexibility to
   create their own schedule. Online bachelor students can still work
   closely with professors to obtain the best education possible.

Health

   A Bachelor in Health Studies provides undergraduate medical students
   with the necessary academic foundation and practical skills for
   pursuing a career in the health field and is a highly popular study
   path worldwide. Undergraduate Health programs are offered in a broad
   range of specializations and typically take three or four years to
   complete.
