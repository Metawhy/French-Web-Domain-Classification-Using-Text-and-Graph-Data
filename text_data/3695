   Really amazing !

   Minha experiência de estagio no Institut Européen de Français me
   possibilitou uma imersão na língua e na cultura francesa, além de ter –
   me permitido fazer belíssimos encontros. O ambiente na escola é
   extremamente agradável e caloroso. O contato com os alunos, com os
   professores e toda a equipe de L’IEF foi ao mesmo tempo amigável e
   profissional. Além do trabalho pude participar de diversos ateliês
   lingüísticos, colaborando dessa maneira para o aperfeiçoamento do

   application de la langue française. Vu que je suis belge, de la coté
   Flandre, la langue française est essentiel pour travailler à notre
   capitale, Bruxelles. Grâce à l’IEF et en particulier grâce à Magaly,
   j’ai trouvé une place de stage extraordinaire. Chez Duo Display, j’ai
   eu le temps de ma vie, travaillant au sein de l’équipe marketing et
