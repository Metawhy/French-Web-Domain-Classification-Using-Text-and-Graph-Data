Little strides

   Monday, March 16, 2015
   I'm continuing with the slow process of putting together my inventory
   of damaged and destroyed items from my water damage. It is a dreaded,
   but necessary process.
    The beautiful sunshine and warm breezes are making it so much more
   bearable.  Being able to open the doors and windows is almost like
   medicine for my soul. So are the little reminders that I continue to
   uncover in the mess.
    And just in case you were ever curious what a 3 week hotel bill looks
   like...

   {crazy, right??}
    I sketched this just before the pipes burst. This part of my
   chalkboard wall didn't get cut out or damaged.  A nice reminder of how
   everything can change and yet some things always remain constant!
    I hope your week is great and remember to count your blessings!

   Wednesday, March 04, 2015

   It's been so long since I have visited with you. I have missed you!

    I have always been the type that needs a lot of time to process the
   big stuff. Maybe that's no different than anyone else, but for me, I
   know I have to sit with big events and decisions and really let them
   marinate in my heart before I can clearly figure out how to navigate
   through them...around them...above them.

   I was sick for the better part of February. It seemed as if nothing
   could lower the fever and leaving the bed was barely possible. After 3
   weeks of feeling bad, I finally felt like leaving the house on Friday,
   the 27th. It was 0 degrees when I left the house that morning,
   record-breaking cold. When I opened the garage door to pull the car in
   that night, water poured under neath the door and a 14" piece of duct
   work hung out of my wet, collapsed ceiling. Water was everywhere. I'm
   not sure how long I just sat there trying to process what I was seeing.
   I had 2 friends with me as I was going to cook us dinner, and I just
   remember them jumping from their car and into the house.

   It felt like a sauna. It was so hot and the water was pouring from the
   ceilings, down the stairs, onto my furniture, and down the walls. The
   floors were full of things floating, chunks of the ceiling, pillows
   from the sofas, It was incredibly dark and so loud and it smelled
   horrible. My animals were terrified. They were surrounded and stuck in
   this mess the entire day - probably 10 hours.

   My brain wouldn't work. As I went up to the middle floor, it too was
   underwater. Water was even pouring out of, with force, the siding on
   the back of the house. Where was this coming from????? I ran room to
   room and ceilings were wet everywhere. Every bit of my clothing and
   shoes in my closet were dripping.

   We finally got to the water valve to turn off the indoor waterfalls. My
   friends grabbed towels and tried sopping up the soaking hardwood floors
   which were already starting to curl. Thank goodness they were with me
   as this part of the day seems so blurry and confusing. They got me to
   call my insurance company which then triggered a series of calls from a
   restoration company, a company to find me a hotel, a company to collect
   my wet clothes....

   The frozen pipes burst in the floor of the 3rd level. Pressure built up
   which caused additional breaks.

   {Living Room}

   All of my clothes, shoes, drapes, and rugs are in SC with an emergency
   textile cleaning company. They won't be returned for another week. I'm
   thankful for a very nice hotel room that I have been living in for 11
   days. But, I miss my house, my bed, my shoes, having my animals with
   me...

   {Where the pretty stuff got made}

   5 days with 40 fans and the house is now deemed dry. All of the
   ceilings and floors have been removed, as well as some walls. The
   insurance company says it should take 3 months to put the house back
   together.

   I am now starting the process of documenting every damaged item. It is
   unbelievably depressing and the amount of time involved is, well
   unreal.

   I keep reminding myself that it's just stuff. That this too shall
   pass.


    As I cling to the comfort and grace that I know is
   undeservedly extended to me, I realize that there are many lessons to
   be learned here and a much simpler life is in the making...

I love What We Do

   Wednesday, January 28, 2015
   I am loving the beautiful artwork created by the design duo of
   WhatWeDo. This Copenhagen architect/designer couple have been creating
   their artwork since 2008 and sell their wares in their etsy store.
   Their newest creations are called Faunascapes which are beautiful
   landscapes and animals printed on plywood. I would love to do a
   collection of these in a nursery!
   They also offer the collection in prints.
   simple, soft and dreamy.....

Well, hello Dolly! A tween room redo

   Monday, January 19, 2015
   I finally have pics to share with you of the recently finished fun
   bedroom that was completed for a sweet 10 year old. It's a great old
   farmhouse with beadboard walls and ceilings and dark wood floors. When
   we started, it was aaaaallllllllllllll pink.
   BEFORE
    I didn't realize it, but even the walls were a soft pink {I thought it
   was simply all of the pink reflecting on white walls!} Everything was
   moved out and the walls got coated in white.
   When discussing with Miss Client what her dream room would look like,
   her reply was 'everything aqua chevron and no pink'..... hhhmmmm.....I
   know that we have all seen a whole lot of chevron over the last few
   years, but she was very persistent in what she wanted. Her dream was to
   have them painted on all the walls, but with old beadboard walls, that
   was not an option that would turn out well. So, we comprised and
   created a large headboard that was mounted to the wall and painted with
   oversized chevrons.
   AFTER
   The fun bedding is the Novogravtz line at Wal-Mart {!} I love all of
   the bold patterns and colors and they are super affordable.
   I added a painted chartreuse yellow band to the lampshade. And the
   little canvas is covered in a piece of scrapbook paper and vinyl stick
   on letters. super easy.
   The vanity was found in another bedroom. I painted it aqua. I made the
   chalkboard out of a piece of masonite and added some trim that was
   painted orange. Little LED wired lights were wrapped around the edge.
   I made the string art from a piece of scrap wood that I stained.
   She is BIG into nail art, so a little lucite polish holder was attached
   to the side of the vanity.
   She is also a huge owl lover. I love these little owl knobs that look
   hand carved that I found on etsy.
   The gold chair is also from the 9 by Novogratz collection and is a
   steal for only $149!!. I made the pillow by painting the black stripes
   on white fabric, fusing the aqua fabric and adding the words with a
   paint pen.
   I made some pom-pons out of purple yarn and added them to the corners.
   The ball garland was made using 2 different sized styrofoam balls. I
   bought lots of complimentary colors of embroidery floss and wrapped
   each ball until it was completely covered. Using a ginormous needle, I
   threaded them onto twine.
   I made tissue paper tassels and clipped them onto a strand of lighted
   clips along with favorite photos. This looks so pretty lit up at
   night!
   The curtains were made from Premier Prints jojo fabric. I kept them
   super casual by attaching them to a wooden rod using rings and clips.
   And my favorite part of the room -- the painting of Ms. Parton!! Miss
   Client loooooves Dolly, so I painted a large canvas using the same
   aqua, orange and chartreuse paints used in other parts of the room.
   We reused 2 of the original pink bookshelves and painted them orange.
   They were then hung behind the door. This provides plenty of great
   storage.
   The striped rug is an 8x11 indoor/outdoor Capel rug. I bought the
   pleated white bedskirt and added a little aqua band to the bottom.  The
   chest, at the end of the bed, was the homeowners. It was given a coat
   of orange paint and offers more storage.
   A happy, fun, Dolly inspired room that suits Miss Client perfectly!!
