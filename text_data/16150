   Canyoning

A Canyoning Q&A With “Extreme Dominica” Guide Jeffrey Charles

   When it comes to witnessing the transformative, natural depths of
   Dominica, canyoning reigns supreme. Amongst the Nature Island’s most
   popular sports, canyoning allows you to descend into the island’s
   canyons, discover the lush rainforest and waterfalls within and, above
   all, walk away with the most memorable and exhilarating life
   experience. We chose to sat down with canyoning guide Jeffrey of
   Extreme Dominica to get an inside look into the incredible sport and
   why Dominica is amongst the best places in the world to do it.

   Tell us about how you got into canyoning.
   I have been a tour guide for the past 22 years and wanted to add
   another exciting adventure into my life. After much thought and
   exploration, I decided to go beyond Titou Gorge to find what was there;
   and, to my surprise, I found several waterfalls and pools, and said
   this is exactly what I’m looking for—a majestic canyon to offer
   visitors and locals.

   What about Dominica makes canyoning so special for you?
   Dominica is very mountainous and the deep canyon valleys have channeled
   the crystal clear water for thousands of years, carving through
   ignimbrite rocks to create this spectacular site.

   Canyoning

   How did you begin introducing tourists to the sport?
   I began working for Extreme Dominica in 2007, when it was founded, but
   I had already been exploring the canyons since 2004. Extreme Dominica
   finally made the sport a reality for tourists and financed it all.

   What about canyoning made you want to introduce it to tourists?
   Canyoning is different from any other tour as you can only access
   hidden waterfalls and pools by way of our specialize equipment. The
   sites have been designed by natural forces and are constantly changing,
   so canyoning is the only way to view them.

   What are the greatest challenges of canyoning? And the greatest
   rewards?
   The greatest challenge is the rain, as I can’t go canyoning myself or
   take other people with me. But, the greatest reward is meeting people
   of different nationalities; it’s an amazing experience beyond compare.
   Throughout the years, many tourists have returned to canyon and we’ve
   always kept in contact.

   Canyoning

   We understand you have a 12 year old son who loves canyoning, too. Do
   you often recommend the sport to kids? What ages?
   I strongly recommend canyoning for children six years and older. The
   youngest I had was three years old, but was carried by his father.

   What should one expect from their canyoning experience?
   Rejuvenation, excitement, love and a sort of baptism of nature and
   peace. And let’s not forget the Cocoa tea and fruits at the end of the
   canyon tour!

   What’s your favorite site in Dominica?
   My favorite site is the boiling lake because it has several varying and
   incredible features: rainforest, elfin forest, rivers, hot bubbling mud
   pools, valley of desolation and so much more.
