About Bnei Baruch

Bnei Baruch is a group of Kabbalists in Israel, sharing the wisdom of
Kabbalah with the entire world. Study materials in over 20 languages are
based on authentic Kabbalah texts that were passed down from generation to
generation.

History and Origin

   Rav Michael Laitman, Professor of ontology and theory of knowledge and
   MSc in medical bio-cybernetics, established Bnei Baruch in 1991,
   following the passing of his teacher, Rabbi Baruch Shalom HaLevi Ashlag
   (The Rabash). Rav Laitman named his group Bnei Baruch (sons of Baruch)
   to commemorate the memory of his mentor, whose side he never left in
   the final 12 years of his life, from 1979 to 1991. Rav Laitman was
   Ashlag’s prime student, personal assistant, and is recognized as the
   successor of Rabash’s teaching method.

   The Rabash is the firstborn son and successor of the greatest Kabbalist
   of the 20th century, Rabbi Yehuda Leib HaLevi Ashlag. Rabbi Yehuda
   Ashlag is author of the most authoritative and comprehensive commentary
   on The Book of Zohar, The Sulam Commentary (The Ladder Commentary), the
   first to reveal the complete method for spiritual ascent. This is also
   the reason for Ashlag’s epithet, Baal HaSulam (Owner of the Ladder).

   Bnei Baruch bases its entire study method on the path paved by these
   great spiritual leaders.

The Study Method

   The unique study method developed by Baal HaSulam and his son the
   Rabash, is taught and applied on a daily basis by Bnei Baruch. This
   method relies on authentic Kabbalah sources such as The Book of Zohar
   (Rabbi Shimon Bar-Yochai), the writings of the Ari, Talmud Eser Sefirot
   (The Study of the Ten Sefirot), as well as other books written by Baal
   HaSulam.

   While the study relies on authentic Kabbalah sources, it is carried out
   in simple language, and with a scientific and contemporary approach.
   Developing this approach has made Bnei Baruch an internationally
   recognized organization in education and highly respected throughout
   Israel.

   The unique combination of an academic study method alongside personal
   experiences broadens the students’ perspective and awards them a new
   perception of the reality they live in. The study method equips those
   on the spiritual path with emotional tools that enable them to research
   themselves and their surrounding reality.

The Message

   Bnei Baruch is a diverse movement of many thousands of students
   worldwide. Each student chooses his or her own path and intensity,
   according to one’s personal conditions and abilities.

   In recent years, the group has grown into a movement engaged in
   voluntary educational projects, presenting genuine Kabbalah sources in
   contemporary language. The essence of the message disseminated by Bnei
   Baruch is unity of the people, unity of nations and love of man.

   For millennia, Kabbalists have been teaching that love of man is the
   foundation of a nation. This love prevailed in the days of Abraham,
   Moses, and the group of Kabbalists that they established. Love of man
   was the fuel propelling the people of Israel to wondrous achievements.
   In times when love of man shifted to unfounded hatred, the nation
   declined into harsh torments.

   If we make room for these old-but-new values, we will discover that we
   possess the power to put aside our differences and unite.

   The wisdom of Kabbalah, hidden for millennia, is now stepping out. It
   has been waiting for the time when we would be sufficiently developed
   and prepared to implement its message. Hence, today it is emerging as a
   message and a solution that can unite the factions in and between the
   nations and bring us all, as individuals and as a society, to a far
   better position.

Bnei Baruch Activities

   Bnei Baruch has been established on the premise that “only by expansion
   of the wisdom of Kabbalah in the general public we will be awarded
   complete redemption” (Baal HaSulam).

   Therefore, Bnei Baruch offers a variety of means for people to explore
   and discover the purpose of their lives, providing careful guidance for
   both beginners and advanced alike.

Kabbalah Newspaper

   The Kabbalah newspaper, Kabbalah Laam (Kabbalah for the People), is
   produced and disseminated by Bnei Baruch on a by-weekly basis. It is
   apolitical, non-commercial, and written in a clear and contemporary
   style. Its purpose is to expose the vast body of knowledge hidden in
   the wisdom of Kabbalah at no cost and in the clearest possible manner.

   The paper is distributed for free throughout Israel. It can also be
   downloaded from the Internet at
   http://www.kab.co.il/bheb/content/view/full/440. Additionally, the
   paper is sent to subscribed readers in Israel at delivery cost only. To
   subscribe, call 1-700-209-509.

   The Hebrew beginners site, www.kab.co.il presents the authentic wisdom
   of Kabbalah using a variety of short video clips and articles.
   Materials for this site were carefully selected and divided into eight
   topics that combine into a clear and coherent picture, suitable for a
   visitor’s first encounter with the wisdom. Also available on the site
   are books for free download and an array of courses in the section
   “Kabbalah Campus.”

   The Bnei Baruch site for advanced students, www.kab.co.il/heb, presents
   the authentic wisdom of Kabbalah using essays, books and original
   texts. The site contains an extensive and unique library for a thorough
   exploration of the wisdom, as well as a media archive,
   www.kabbalahmedia.info, with more than 5,000 media items, downloadable
   books, and a vast reservoir of texts, video and audio files in many
   languages. All material is available for free download.

Kabbalah Television

   Bnei Baruch established a production company, ARI Films
   (www.arifilms.tv) specializing in production of educational TV programs
   throughout the world and in many languages.

   In Israel, Bnei Baruch broadcasts are aired live on channels 25 (cable)
   and 98 (satellite) Sunday through Friday. All broadcasts on these
   channels are free of charge. The programs on these channels are
   especially adapted for beginners and do not require prior knowledge.
   This convenient learning process is complemented by programs featuring
   Rav Laitman’s meetings with publicly known figures in Israel and
   throughout the world.

   Additionally, ARI Films produces educational series on DVDs,
   documentaries and other visual teaching aids.

Kabbalah Lectures

   Bnei Baruch recently opened a new study center in Israel called, Beit
   Kabbalah Laam (Kabbalah for the People House). The venue comprises two
   halls: a large hall for public lectures and a small hall for various
   Kabbalah lessons in smaller groups. Lessons and lectures take place in
   the mornings and evenings, and introduce various topics, explained
   according to authentic Kabbalah sources in a manner suitable for both
   beginners and advanced.

Kabbalah Books

   Rav Laitman writes his books in a clear and up-to-date language, based
   on the key concepts of Baal HaSulam. Today, these books serve as a
   vital “link” between readers and the original texts. Rav Laitman’s
   books in Hebrew are essentially divided into two series: Kabbalah and
   the Wisdom of Life, and Kabbalah in Practice. All of Laitman’s books
   are available for free download at
   http://www.kab.co.il/bheb/content/view/full/297, and can be purchased
   at www.kabbalahbooks.co.il.

Kabbalah Lessons

   As Kabbalists have been doing for centuries, Rav Laitman gives a daily
   lesson at the Bnei Baruch center in Israel between 3:15-6:00AM Israel
   time. The lessons are simultaneously translated into six languages:
   English, Russian, Spanish, German, Italian, and Turkish. In the near
   future, broadcasts will be translated into French, Greek, Polish, and
   Portuguese, as well. As with everything else, the live broadcast is
   provided free for thousands of students worldwide.

   For more details call 1-700-209-509.

Funding

   Bnei Baruch is a non-profit organization for teaching and sharing the
   wisdom of Kabbalah. To maintain its independence and purity of
   intentions, Bnei Baruch is not supported, funded or otherwise tied to
   any government or political organization. Since the bulk of its
   activity is provided free of charge, the prime source of funding for
   the group’s activities is tithing, contributed by students on a
   voluntary basis. Additional sources of income are Rav Laitman’s books
   that are sold at cost, and donations.
