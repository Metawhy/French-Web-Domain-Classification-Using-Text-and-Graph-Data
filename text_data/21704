Welcome to Pinboard!

   Social Bookmarking for Introverts
     * Pinboard is a fast, no-nonsense bookmarking site for people who
       value privacy and speed.
     * There are no ads and no third-party tracking. You pay a few bucks a
       year, and that's it.
     * Pinboard lets you bookmark from any browser, connect up to three
       Twitter accounts (and favorites), and sync with popular services
       like Instapaper or Pocket.
     * For a few more bucks a year, Pinboard offers an archiving service
       which saves a copy of everything you bookmark, gives you full-text
       search, and automatically checks your account for dead links.
     * Take a quick tour of the site to see the kinds of things it can do.

Time

   “A one-man operation can compete against million dollar corporations
   and thrive.”

The Guardian

   “Pinboard is a very effective service… Sometimes, you don't need glitz;
   you need plumbing.”

Wired

   “A clever bookmarking service that lets you organize links […] and even
   cache copies of entire web pages.”

The Economist

   “One dude in his underpants somewhere who has five windows open to
   terminal servers.”
