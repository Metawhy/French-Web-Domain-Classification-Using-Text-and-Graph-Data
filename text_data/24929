   Not a big history fan of the East Indies and colonization era. But
   visiting the Archives of the Indies in Secille was very interesting to
   see how it’s linked to my country's history. Did you know Christopher
   Columbus is actually Italian, and not Spanish like my country taught
   me? 🤯🤯 I found out a few years ago when I went to Genoa. I was lied to
   my entire life. Every time I share this with people from South America,
   I get the same reaction 🤯🤯🤯 where you lied to in school too? Not a big

   Setenil De Las Bodegas, one of the white towns in Andalucía, is famous
   for its houses built under a rock. When I was passing by, a few of the
   houses were getting remodeled, and I got to see inside. The “house
   construction” is the front wall you see, the back “wall” is the rock!

   Road tripping in Spain was such a nice surprise. The roads are filled
   with sunflower fields, rolling hills, and medieval castles 😍 I really
   enjoyed visiting the white towns as many feel very authentic with mom &
   pop’s restaurants and locals greeting you. Road tripping in Spain was
