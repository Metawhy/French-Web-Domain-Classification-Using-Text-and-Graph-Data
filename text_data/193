Anxiety and Depression and Associated Stressors among Health Science Students
in the Middle East

   By Sridevi Adivi

   Independent Public Health Consultant, ISECN Eastern Mediterranean
   Regional Editor

   Anxiety and depression are good indicators for mental health
   assessment.  Students of health sciences universities are no exception
   to the growing global phenomenon of stress causing anxiety and
   depression. Medical education is dynamic with expanding knowledge and
   evolving therapies. The objective is to acquire knowledge, gain
   proficiency and become competent. (1) Studies have been conducted
   worldwide while the region of the Middle East is understudied and the
   few studies conducted report high level of anxiety and depression.
   First year students are a unique population with a transition to a
   complex environment followed by dynamic academic stressors. (2) An
   exclusive feature of the region is a diverse student population from
   multiethnic backgrounds and from different languages of instruction in
   high schools.  Diversity is prominent as children of expatriates and
   students of neighboring countries secure admission and a primary reason
   for studies in the region focusing on the first year students. Stress
   in the first year is attributed to emotional and academic components,
   and in the ensuing years, to physical factors and patient care.
   Academic evaluations, lack of leisure time and peer support, living
   away from families and financial issues, all stimulate fear, lack of
   ability and anger causing anxiety and depression. (3)

   This paper is a compendium of the studies conducted in Arab Countries
   namely United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain and Egypt. The
   cross-sectional surveys studied the prevalence of anxiety and
   depression among medical, pharmaceutical and nursing students.
   Participation in the surveys was voluntary, anonymous and students were
   administered questionnaires. Influence of demography, psychosocial,
   behavioral, health and academic factors on the mental health of student
   population was evaluated. Majority of the participants constituted of
   first year students except in two studies that had first, sixth year,
   pre-clinical and clinical stages to assess difference in prevalence.

   In Egypt, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, participants belonged
   to first year of medicine, pharmaceutical, nursing and dental. The
   volunteers answered a self-administered questionnaire for the analysis
   of stressors. The nursing students were of two categories; direct
   admission from high school and after graduation. Data analyzed showed
   uniformity and no distinction among the categories. Analysis
   demonstrated academics as the highest stressor followed by
   environmental and interpersonal factors for anxiety and depression.
   Incidence of depression worsened from beginning of the year to the end.
   (2) The first survey in Egypt was conducted with a two part
   questionnaire completed by 379 first year medical students.

   The first part was a data collection instrument identified the
   demographic and risk factors of psychological health. Second part was
   an Arab version of Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS). Major
   percentages of participants were living with families and perceived
   moderate socio-economic standard. Only 8.7% suffered from single
   psychological illness. Alarmingly, 34.6% and 46.9% suffered from triple
   concomitant and double concomitant psychological illnesses**. Men were
   prone to depression and women were prone to anxiety and stress.
   Behavioral and existing medical conditions were considered for
   associated psychological illnesses. Depression was associated with
   insomnia, physical illness and frequent consumption of coffee and tea.
   Education in English was an associated stress factor. (1)

   In Egypt, Equal number of subjects from the first year of two streams;
   medical and pharmaceutical, showed that anxiety and depression were
   significant in both streams. Arabic version of Beck’s Anxiety Index and
   Beck’s Depression Inventory acted as tools of measurement with 21
   multiple choice answers. Predominant levels of anxiety and depression
   exhibited in medical stream compared to pharma stream. This was
   attributed to medical students passing through several examinations,
   being critical about self and socially isolated when compared to the
   pharmaceutical students.  Gender differences were noted showing that
   symptoms are more visible among women. Women voice out their stress due
   to high load curriculum, physical and psychological distress and less
   job opportunities in comparison to men. (2)

   In Bahrain, comparative analysis of first and sixth year students was
   conducted utilizing the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Gender
   played no significant role among the first and sixth year students.
   Based on HADS scoring the subjects were segregated into three groups-
   normal, mild and severe. Figures from the ANOVA test demonstrated
   prevalence of anxiety and depression was higher among participants from
   the sixth year than the first year.  Lesser number of students
   classified as normal in comparison to the first year.  It also suggests
   that medical students experience more stressors in addition to everyday
   life. (5) The cross sectional study from Oman had voluntary
   participation of pre-clinical and clinical graduate students. Majority
   of the subjects were women and urban residents. Stress factors varied
   such as mild stress when discussing personal problems with patients,
   abuse as secondary and severe stress for lack of family time. Students
   were stressed by poor marks, large burden of study material,
   assessments and time constraints. Coping strategies varied from
   planning things ahead and religion. (4)

   In United Arab Emirates, all students of the first year from
   professional courses were contacted for the survey.  Student population
   consisted of 35 nationalities and many were in the Emirates for the
   first time. The first two parts of the questionnaire obtained
   demographic details and general health using the validated GHQ-12
   (General Health Questionnaire with 12 questions). The third part for
   sources of stress was validated and tested prior to application. The
   stressors were classified into academic, psychological and health.
   Frequency of assessments, overload of work and managing time are the
   academic components. Worry about future, high expectations by parents
   and interactions with members of opposite sex were the psychosocial
   components. Health related components were lack of physical activity
   and lack of healthy diet combined with irregular eating habits are the
   associated stressors. Psychosocial morbidity was higher among students
   with other languages of instruction in high school. Coping with English
   is a stressor irrespective of the demographic group. The GHQ-12
   revealed that one in 3 students exhibited psychological morbidity.
   Psychosocial components precede other factors though no significant
   differences were found among the genders or the students of different
   faculties. (6)

   Conclusion

   Anxiety and depression have negative effects on the physical and mental
   health of the students, which in turn, impacts their education. (2) The
   cross-sectional studies show that medical students are burdened by
   anxiety and stress owing to different stressors. Academic stressors
   rank first, psychosocial rank second and demography impacts minimally.
   Subsequently, the disability to perform in class and impairment to
   technical procedures can cause harm to patients, relationship with
   peers, faculty and family. The stress and deteriorating performance can
   prolong into their internship and clinical practice. (4) Early
   detection and treatment can shorten the duration the episodes of
   depression and reduces the impact. (1)  Physical activity, meditation,
   planned time outs and other coping methods aid in stress management.
   Counselling and teaching stress management from first year is
   imperative to enhance the standards of healthcare in the region.

   Limitations to these surveys are smaller populations and larger number
   of female students to express significant differences among gender or
   year of study. These countries have produced little research in the
   area of medical education and stress. Sensitivity of the student
   population to traditional and cultural beliefs is an important
   influencer to be considered in future research. Improved research with
   the inclusion of criteria like tobacco use, internet and social media
   addiction are suggested for complete assessment of information.

   ** Percentage quoted due to presence of more than one psychological
   illness.
