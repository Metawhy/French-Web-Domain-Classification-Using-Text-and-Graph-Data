Plasticité cérébrale et surdité chez l'adulte

   Calendar
   Le but de nos travaux est de progresser dans la compréhension des
   processus de récupération des fonctions auditives et langagières après
   implantation cochléaire ou prothèse auditive. La surdité profonde est à
   ce jour le seul handicap sensoriel qui

Pupillometry to index visual perception and its inter-individual differences

   Calendar
   The pupil is primarily regulated by prevailing light levels, but is
   also modulated by perceptual and attentional factors.

CANCELLED - Tuning the Auditory System for Vocal Communication

   Calendar
   Abstract: Auditory-vocal communication requires the coordinated
   development of sensory and motor circuits around sounds that convey
   social information. When communication sounds are learned, the brain
   must use experience to build auditory and vocal motor circuits that

Feedback processing in monkey visual cortex

   Calendar
   Our perception is an inherently active process. We dynamically select
   information that is behaviorally relevant for us at given moments in
   time, enabling us to interact effectively with the world around us.

Sensory processing: how the past affects the present

   Calendar
   Paris, 21 and 22 November 2013Organized by Alain de Cheveigné, Daniel
   Pressnitzer, Israel Nelken, and Claire Chambers.

"Women in Science" Panel Discussion

   Calendar
   Where is it harder for women, across career stages? How do implicit
   biases shape our attitudes towards our colleagues? How can we reduce
   inequalities? What organisations and support are available for women?

Neural mechanisms for short-term shifts of interocular balance

   Calendar
   Abstract: Recent studies in adult humans have shown that short-term
   deprivation of one eye (1-3hrs) dramatically shifts the balance in
   favor of this eye for over an hour afterwards.

Computational Neuroimaging of Human Auditory Cortex

   Calendar
   Just by listening, humans can determine who is talking to them, whether
   a window in their house is open or shut, or what their child dropped on
   the floor in the next room.

   How do children learn to read? How do deficits in various components of
   the reading network affect learning outcomes? How does remediating one
   or several components change reading performance?

Invariant and hierarchical computation in human auditory cortex

   Calendar
   Just by listening, humans infer a host of useful information about
   events in the world. Much is known about peripheral auditory
   processing, but auditory cortex remains poorly understood, particularly
   in computational terms.

Using technology to improve assessment and treatment of vision in children

   Calendar
   Measuring vision is important in a range of clinical settings, from
   monitoring the effectiveness of gene therapies for blinding eye
   conditions through to early detection of age-related eye diseases like
   glaucoma.  My lab uses technologies such as infrared eye tracking and
   virtual reality to measu
