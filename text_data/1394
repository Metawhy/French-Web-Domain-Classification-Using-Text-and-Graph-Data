Answers to 10 most common job interview questions

Here are the most commonly asked interview questions you can expect to be
asked in your interview and advice on how you can craft effective responses.


    Carole Martin, Monster contributor

   Answers to 10 most common job interview questions

   Be ready to answer these frequently asked interview questions.

   Too many job seekers stumble through interviews as if the questions
   asked are coming out of left field. But many interview questions are to
   be expected. Study this list of popular and frequently asked interview
   questions and answers ahead of time so you'll be ready to answer them
   with confidence.

1. What are your weaknesses?

   "What are your weaknesses" is one of the most popular questions
   interviewers ask. It is also the most dreaded question of all. Handle
   it by minimizing your weakness and emphasizing your strengths. Stay
   away from personal qualities and concentrate on professional traits: "I
   am always working on improving my communication skills to be a more
   effective presenter. I recently joined Toastmasters, which I find very
   helpful."

2. Why should we hire you?

   Answer "Why should we hire you?" by summarizing your experiences: "With
   five years' experience working in the financial industry and my proven
   record of saving the company money, I could make a big difference in
   your company. I'm confident I would be a great addition to your team."

3. Why do you want to work here?

   By asking you, "Why do you want to work here?" the interviewer is
   listening for an answer that indicates you've given this some thought
   and are not sending out resumes just because there is an opening. For
   example, "I've selected key companies whose mission statements are in
   line with my values, where I know I could be excited about what the
   company does, and this company is very high on my list of desirable
   choices."

4. What are your goals?

   When you're asked, "What are your goals?" sometimes it's best to talk
   about short-term and intermediate goals rather than locking yourself
   into the distant future. For example, "My immediate goal is to get a
   job in a growth-oriented company. My long-term goal will depend on
   where the company goes. I hope to eventually grow into a position of
   responsibility."

5. Why did you leave (or why are you leaving) your job?

   If an interviewer asks, "Why did you leave (or why are you leaving)
   your job?" and you're unemployed, state your reason for leaving in a
   positive context: "I managed to survive two rounds of corporate
   downsizing, but the third round was a 20% reduction in the workforce,
   which included me."

   If you are employed, focus on what you want in your next job: "After
   two years, I made the decision to look for a company that is
   team-focused, where I can add my experience."

6. When were you most satisfied in your job?

   The interviewer who asks, "When were you most satisfied in your
   job?" wants to know what motivates you. If you can relate an example of
   a job or project when you were excited, the interviewer will get an
   idea of your preferences. "I was very satisfied in my last job, because
   I worked directly with the customers and their problems; that is an
   important part of the job for me."

7. What can you do for us that other candidates can't?

   Emphasize what makes you unique when you're asked, "What can you do for
   us that other candidates can't?". This will take an assessment of your
   experiences, skills and traits. Summarize concisely: "I have a unique
   combination of strong technical skills, and the ability to build strong
   customer relationships. This allows me to use my knowledge and break
   down information to be more user-friendly."

8. What are three positive things your last boss would say about you?

   It's time to pull out your old performance appraisals and boss's quotes
   to answer the question, "What are three positive things your last boss
   would say about you?". This is a great way to brag about yourself
   through someone else's words: "My boss has told me that I am the best
   designer he has ever had. He knows he can rely on me, and he likes my
   sense of humor."

9. What salary are you seeking?

   When you're asked, "What salary are you seeking?" it is to your
   advantage if the employer tells you the range first. Prepare by knowing
   the going rate in your area, and your bottom line or walk-away point.
   One possible answer would be: "I am sure when the time comes, we can
   agree on a reasonable amount. In what range do you typically pay
   someone with my background?"

10. If you were an animal, which one would you want to be?

   Don't be alarmed if you're asked, "If you were an animal, which one
   would you want to be?" Interviewers use this type of psychological
   question to see if you can think quickly. If you answer "a bunny," you
   will make a soft, passive impression. If you answer "a lion," you will
   be seen as aggressive. What type of personality would it take to get
   the job done? What impression do you want to make?

   One last question for you: Are you looking for more ways to stand apart
   from the competition? Of course you are. Join Monster today. As a
   member, you'll get career advice and useful tips sent directly to your
   inbox. It's a quick and easy way to stay one step ahead.

Answers to 10 most common job interview questions

Here are the most commonly asked interview questions you can expect to be
asked in your interview and advice on how you can craft effective responses.


    Carole Martin, Monster contributor

   Answers to 10 most common job interview questions

   Be ready to answer these frequently asked interview questions.

   Too many job seekers stumble through interviews as if the questions
   asked are coming out of left field. But many interview questions are to
   be expected. Study this list of popular and frequently asked interview
   questions and answers ahead of time so you'll be ready to answer them
   with confidence.

1. What are your weaknesses?

   "What are your weaknesses" is one of the most popular questions
   interviewers ask. It is also the most dreaded question of all. Handle
   it by minimizing your weakness and emphasizing your strengths. Stay
   away from personal qualities and concentrate on professional traits: "I
   am always working on improving my communication skills to be a more
   effective presenter. I recently joined Toastmasters, which I find very
   helpful."

2. Why should we hire you?

   Answer "Why should we hire you?" by summarizing your experiences: "With
   five years' experience working in the financial industry and my proven
   record of saving the company money, I could make a big difference in
   your company. I'm confident I would be a great addition to your team."

3. Why do you want to work here?

   By asking you, "Why do you want to work here?" the interviewer is
   listening for an answer that indicates you've given this some thought
   and are not sending out resumes just because there is an opening. For
   example, "I've selected key companies whose mission statements are in
   line with my values, where I know I could be excited about what the
   company does, and this company is very high on my list of desirable
   choices."

4. What are your goals?

   When you're asked, "What are your goals?" sometimes it's best to talk
   about short-term and intermediate goals rather than locking yourself
   into the distant future. For example, "My immediate goal is to get a
   job in a growth-oriented company. My long-term goal will depend on
   where the company goes. I hope to eventually grow into a position of
   responsibility."

5. Why did you leave (or why are you leaving) your job?

   If an interviewer asks, "Why did you leave (or why are you leaving)
   your job?" and you're unemployed, state your reason for leaving in a
   positive context: "I managed to survive two rounds of corporate
   downsizing, but the third round was a 20% reduction in the workforce,
   which included me."

   If you are employed, focus on what you want in your next job: "After
   two years, I made the decision to look for a company that is
   team-focused, where I can add my experience."

6. When were you most satisfied in your job?

   The interviewer who asks, "When were you most satisfied in your
   job?" wants to know what motivates you. If you can relate an example of
   a job or project when you were excited, the interviewer will get an
   idea of your preferences. "I was very satisfied in my last job, because
   I worked directly with the customers and their problems; that is an
   important part of the job for me."

7. What can you do for us that other candidates can't?

   Emphasize what makes you unique when you're asked, "What can you do for
   us that other candidates can't?". This will take an assessment of your
   experiences, skills and traits. Summarize concisely: "I have a unique
   combination of strong technical skills, and the ability to build strong
   customer relationships. This allows me to use my knowledge and break
   down information to be more user-friendly."

8. What are three positive things your last boss would say about you?

   It's time to pull out your old performance appraisals and boss's quotes
   to answer the question, "What are three positive things your last boss
   would say about you?". This is a great way to brag about yourself
   through someone else's words: "My boss has told me that I am the best
   designer he has ever had. He knows he can rely on me, and he likes my
   sense of humor."

9. What salary are you seeking?

   When you're asked, "What salary are you seeking?" it is to your
   advantage if the employer tells you the range first. Prepare by knowing
   the going rate in your area, and your bottom line or walk-away point.
   One possible answer would be: "I am sure when the time comes, we can
   agree on a reasonable amount. In what range do you typically pay
   someone with my background?"

10. If you were an animal, which one would you want to be?

   Don't be alarmed if you're asked, "If you were an animal, which one
   would you want to be?" Interviewers use this type of psychological
   question to see if you can think quickly. If you answer "a bunny," you
   will make a soft, passive impression. If you answer "a lion," you will
   be seen as aggressive. What type of personality would it take to get
   the job done? What impression do you want to make?

   One last question for you: Are you looking for more ways to stand apart
   from the competition? Of course you are. Join Monster today. As a
   member, you'll get career advice and useful tips sent directly to your
   inbox. It's a quick and easy way to stay one step ahead.
