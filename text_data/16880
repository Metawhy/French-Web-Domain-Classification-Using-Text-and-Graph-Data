   Trinity Church
   Broadway at Wall Street
   7:00 am - 6:00 pm

   Trinity Church, the third church building on this site, was consecrated
   in 1846. It is the home of an active, growing congregation with worship
   services in the Chapel of All Saints every weekday and Sunday mornings.
   The chapel is open to visitors every day, but the main sanctuary is
   currently closed for a two-year rejuvenation project. The churchyard is
   also open to visitors who wish to visit Alexander Hamilton’s grave and
   other historic memorials or enjoy a moment of quiet.
