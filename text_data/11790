Hot off the press

   An old saying tells us that silence is golden. At the 31st Annual EAIE
   Conference and Exhibition in Helsinki, however, silence is the last
   thing we’re looking for as we come together to actively consider what
   ‘encompassing all voices’ can, should and does mean in our field today.
   The Conference Conversation Starter provides a unique starting point
   for this discussion.

   ‘Money matters’ leverages practitioner perspectives to investigate the
   role of funding for internationalisation in Europe. Please join me for
   the launch session at #EAIE2019 for a dive into the data, and some
   stimulating discussion!
   Laura Rumbley - 18 September

   The “Macron initiative” still divides opinions. Are European
   Universities destined to become a European Champions League of Higher
   Education Institutions? Is it a threat to smaller Higher Education
   Institutions?
   #EAIE2019 has chosen the session “The "Macron" initiative - the right
   step towards a European Champions League?” to become the EAIE debate.
   Be part of this disrupting discussion on Thursday 26 September.
