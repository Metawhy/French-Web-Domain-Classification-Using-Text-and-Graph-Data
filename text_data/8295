   Shapinsky</p></div> <hr /> <p>Twenty New York blocks gets you a mile.
   Back in &#8220;our time,&#8221; a motley crew of urban youth crossed
   the Manhattan landscape with that formula in our heads. We understood
   distance. We got time. We lived the algebraic formula of Time x Speed =
   Distance.†If we started peddling our bikes at the top of the hill on
   Lexington just above 34th, we would coast all the way to 23rd street,
   shaving minutes, reserving energy, and feeling wind on our faces all
   the way to Gramercy Park. In the New York summer that was special, like
   soft ice cream, a public swimming pool, and playing in an open fire
   hydrant.</p> <p>Some days we ran through the subway. But riding a bike
   kept dollars in your pocket, something that mattered to me. With two
   impoverished artists as my parents, I never wanted money for moneyôs
   sake;†but freedom, yeah. I started searching for that feeling of freedom
   on bike rides more than thirty years ago and I am still searching now.
   Longing for the same rush, the peace, and the joy.</p> <p>We flew from
   the Lower East Side to the Cloisters. We glided down to Chinatown and
   back through Little Italy. On a Saturday or Sunday, we might ride from
   Washington Square to Central Park and back down to Wall Street. And
   wherever we went, we counted up miles at the end and marveled at our
   odometer. 100 blocks? By our soft math: Five miles. Up and back? Ten
   miles. We boogied. We inflated. We rose and fell through side streets
   and avenues, scraping up against cabs, barely avoiding pedestrians, and
   chasing all that we did not have.</p> <p>Like children everywhere,
   <i>we weren&#8217;t</i> and yet <i>we were</i> special. Kids in pursuit
   of adventure.†Looking for fun. Building our own realities.<span
   class="Apple-converted-space">†</span></p> <p>Beneath it all, however,
   something bled us. We tried to avoid the fires around us by moving
   rapidly through the alleys and parks and streets. When blind turns
   came, we kept moving. Was it enough? Not even close, but we were the
   lucky ones.</p> <p>Cut a corner in Little Italy, riding up from South
   Street on a Saturday or Sunday; suddenly, there were white
   &#8220;Italian&#8221; boys on our tails chasing us and throwing bottles
   from their bikes. We had crossed a line. Wrong place? Wrong Time? Was
   it the way we looked or talked or dressed? Because we were a polyglot
   group, a stew of race,†religion, and class? Were we feared and hated for
   what we were or appeared to be?</p> <p>During those years, there was
   freedom, but there was also fear. That feelingîthe cold sweating terror
   that eats away at you day after day after day and turns you inside out.
   Powerlessness creates an inner rage. Some of my friends fell prey to
   that rage, becoming enamored of guns. That was one way to live and die.
   <span class="Apple-converted-space">†</span></p> <p>Most of us simply
   learned that a random moment could change your life or someone
   else&#8217;s life, snuff it out, or put your body and soul in a
   blender.<span class="Apple-converted-space">†</span></p> <p>Certain days
   are embedded in my memory. I see my best friend, a tall and powerful
   African American teen who looked like a man years older, struggling on
   the ropes, unable to avoid a round of &#8220;who you looking at&#8221;
   with a crew of older boys.<span class="Apple-converted-space">† </span>A
   muscled teen banged my friend with his fists over and over, continuing
   the cycle of violence as I and other friends watched, helpless and
   ashamed, stuck behind a wall of boys. We felt weak. In our minds, we
   were weak. Sometimes we even thought we deserved to be called úfaggotsù
   by our tormenters. At a time when homophobia was celebrated, gay and
   straight could sometimes be victims together because of the blind
   hatred surrounding all of us. But perpetrators and victims also shared
   something: self-loathing.</p> <p>By the standards of our East Village
   neighborhood, my crew of friends lived well but not easily. We were the
   children of intellectuals and artists, people who settled their
   families in or near Alphabet City, a neighborhood of new and old
   immigrants and working poor. Looking back, our parents might today be
   called urban pioneers. But back then, other people just thought them
   crazy. What parent would subject their children to poor public schools
   and crime? Prostitutes walked just a couple of blocks away. Homeless
   men often lay on the sidewalk; I stepped around them on the way to
   school.</p> <p>My elementary school, P.S. 63, was mostly Puerto Rican,
   which opened my eyes to many things. I still feel a connection to that
   Caribbean island and its flag, having colored it so many times at
   school. But I wasnôt Puerto Rican. Nor was I Black or Chinese. I was
   skinny a kid with blond hair. Sometimes I stuck out. Other times I
   crossed over.<span class="Apple-converted-space">† </span>Luckily, one
   summer I played baseball with an entirely Puerto Rican team except for
   myself. I was embraced. <span class="Apple-converted-space">†</span></p>
   <p>It was all Russian Roulette. One day could change it all. How was I
   to know what a zip gun looked like when I was surrounded at my
   elementary school one winter morning by some boys. They pressed it to
   my gut. I stayed calm. I simply did not know the danger. And that
   probably saved me from a hospital. In that same school yard, sitting on
   a bench waiting to get into a basketball game, an older boy, maybe 15,
   showed me two large knives. All he said to me was: &#8220;I wonder what
   it would be like to stick these in someone&#8217;s neck.&#8221; In that
   moment, he held power over me but I just said úyeah.ù Because I had
   already learned to pretend that I didnôt feel anything.</p> <p>One of
   the worst days came when my best friend, the same one who had endured a
   terrible beating for nothing, spent a good chunk of his 5th grade
   recess†being chased through the schoolyard by about a dozen older boys.
   None of the teachers moved. Maybe they didn&#8217;t understand the
   danger? I asked these adults to help my friend. They did nothing. And
   that was a powerful lesson. The only thing that saved my friend was an
   African-American stranger, a man we didnôt know stepping out of nowhere
   and with one punch, sending the horde fleeing. It seemed impossible.
   Like God had reached down and answered our prayers.</p> <p>That was
   life for our little gang, the children of bohemians, whose parents had
   embraced a neighborhood they could afford. We were forever changed by
   living on a tightrope of wonder and fear. Our parents taught us ideals
   and talked about ideas. They were painters, writers, dancers, actors,
   musicians, and teachers. They believed in their art and had artistic
   egos.</p> <p>They could see suffering around them. The Vietnam War
   raged. Our parents marched. Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were
   assassinated in the same year. But did our parents know that as
   eight-year olds, we played úChicago Riotsù on the playground. Did they
   know how close the chaos and violence were to them through us?<span
   class="Apple-converted-space">†</span></p> <p>We never told them. But
   looking back on those years after I had my own children, I made one
   simple promise to myself and my sons. It was that they should never
   know such thingsîthe hatred, the raw violence, and the early loss of
   innocence too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">†</span></p> <p>Still,
   all my friends paid a price. Most of us survived. Some danced at the
   edges of a violent world. Others fell to drugs and saw their lives
   spinning out of control. Some died. I escaped by moving thousands of
   miles away to California. We all took refuge; but inside, it has taken
   decades for me to find peace.<span
   class="Apple-converted-space">†</span></p> <p>Before finding any kind of
   peace, I learned that my many childhood nightmares about people
   breaking in to my familyôs apartment were a metaphor for how vulnerable
   I felt and how fragile my life really was.†On one level, as I got older,
   things were going great. When I was twenty years old, I fell in love
   with a beautiful and brilliant woman.†On†a summer night on a dark stoop
   in the East Village we kissed. I left her in the early morning to go to
   Europe for a college semester abroad, in Rome, one of the most romantic
   cities in the world.<span class="Apple-converted-space">†</span></p>
   <p>Then, months later, when the romantic semester was over, I learned
   my parents had given up their rent-control apartment and decided to
   flee New York with no money and hardly a plan. They had sold all their
   furniture or put it in storage. My childhood belongings might have
   existed somewhere, but they were essentially torched. I never found
   them again. The chaos that had always been lurking under my life had
   bubbled up. Friends taught me the value of love and friendship, keeping
   me above water. I stayed in college even as I had to figure out how to
   get myself through it all financially and emotionally.</p> <p>The
   following summer, my parents had found a small sublet. My father had
   lost 60 pounds. He looked frail and barely went outside. My parents
   thought he was sick, suffering from MS or perhaps some other disease. I
   found a job and slept in a tiny dining room next to the bathroom. My
   optimism held, but I could feel it slipping.</p> <p>And then one night
   that summer a sound woke me up. I stood. The bathroom door was open. My
   father lay in the tub. His wrists slit. I woke my mother and called the
   police and ambulance. We took him to the hospital. His own sticky
   reality had brought him to this place. Feelings of failure. Being told
   by his mother that she tried to abort him. Having to drop out of school
   to support his family. Knowing that he was a failure in his
   family&#8217;s eyes for being a painter rather than something useful.
   He heard voices and saw people who werenôt there. His fears became his
   entire life. Now I knew the fear came from inside my home as much as
   outside it.</p> <p>Whatever innocence I still had was gone. My father
   survived, but it would take another ten years for me to get back the
   hope and feelings of adventure that went with those early bike rides
   through the canyons of the City. It would take me even longer to
   discover my own path. But the lesson I took from it all is not that any
   of us are victims or failures: We all struggle to become more than we
   are while breaking free of legacies of our past. There is nothing more
   heroic than thatîor harder to achieve.</p> <p>May we all succeed and
   help others along the way.<span

   <p>I was eleven when I got my first paper route. You had to be
   thirteen.</p> <p>úIf the route manager approves it, Iôll give it to you,ù
   Freddy Bullwinkle said. Kids called him Bullwinkle because he had big
   ears. A few days later it was mine. <em>The Long Island Star
   Journal.</em></p> <p>úRemember, John, the most important part of the job
   is collecting.ù He winked.† úIf you get any new customers, you get cash or
   prizes.ù</p> <p>I did great. I liked people and people liked me, and
   most important it got me out of the house.</p> <p>A couple of months
   later, I picked up the papers at the delivery spot at the 32nd Avenue
   underpass to the BQE. As I cut the twine away, I noticed the headline.
   Martin Luther King Jr. Killed.</p> <p>They shot him.†I sat on the paper
   stack and tried to read what happened. I sucked at reading. It said he
   was dead. I shuffled the papers into my cart and thought, whoôs going to
   be their leader now? My Aunt Loretta who lived in a black section of
   the Bronx had said he was going to be killed next. She was right. They
   killed Malcolm X, and now him.</p> <p>After I finished delivering I
   went home. I was working on a bowl of cereal at the kitchen table and
   looking through my route book. It was Friday. I needed to do some
   collecting. My mutt Charcoal barked wildly, and next thing I knew Dad
   was in the kitchen doorway.</p> <p>úWhereôs your mother?ù He had the look
   and sound of booze in his eyes and voice.</p> <p>úI donôt know, I just
   got in.ù I wanted to say, what do I look like, a freaking crystal ball?
   But I didnôt. I wasnôt that stupid. Even if I did have an escape route
   behind me. I could jump out of any window of this second-floor house
   and get away from this crazy father of mine before he got one step
   closer.</p> <p>úWhere ya been?ù he growled.</p> <p>úDelivered the papers.ù
   I held one out to him. úHereôs an extra.ù</p> <p>He looked at the
   headline. úFuckin CIA did it again! First Kennedy, now this poor prick.
   Thereôs going to be plenty of riots.ù He threw the paper back at me.
   úYouôre too young to be delivering that shit.ù</p> <p>úI just turned 12 two
   days ago. You werenôt even home.ù</p> <p>úDonôt bullshit me. I watched you
   delivering for months now.ù†He glared at me. The window again became an
   option. úWhat does everyone say about that mop of hair on your head,
   Reidy?ù</p> <p>úNo one says nothing.ù</p> <p>He lit a cigarette from the
   gas jet on the stove. I thought he would burn his eyebrows, he was that
   close.† I settled back into the bowl of Rice Krispies and heard the
   crunching of the cereal in my ears.</p> <p>Thatôs when I first noticed a
   few cockroaches in the bowl. Legs up.†My God, I thought, pregnant ones.
   The eggs on their bodies looked like the Rice Krispies. I had†definitely
   eaten a few. I pushed the bowl away.</p> <p>úI think I just ate roach
   eggs.ù</p> <p>Dad made a úwho caresù face.† úDonôt worry, itôs protein. It
   wonôt kill you.ù He had all the answers. And that made it easy.</p> <p>I
   thought about it, pulled the bowl back and finished it off. I put it in
   the sink.</p> <p>úWash that bowl and bring it over here,ù he said. Dad
   pulled a quart of Rheingold beer out of a brown paper bag and guzzled
   some. úCome on, Reidy, clean that bowl off nice. Iôll be right back.ù He
   left the kitchen.</p> <p>I rinsed the bowl with water, then shook it
   off and dried it with my undershirt.</p> <p>He came strolling back in
   with a smile. úGimme that bowl and sit on the table.ù</p> <p>I did what
   he told me.</p> <p>úIf your Momôs too busy to get you a haircut, I guess
   Iôll have to do it myself.ù He placed the bowl on my head. It felt kind
   of like an army helmet, and thatôs all Dad talked about anyway.†I didnôt
   mind. It took me away from the thought of a million baby cockroaches
   hatching in my stomach. He pulled a large pair of scissors from his
   back pocket and started to cut my hair.</p> <p>He cut and snipped while
   I searched my route book for customers who owed more than one week. I
   paid him no mind. He took another swig of beer, then pulled the bowl
   off.</p> <p>He did a few quick snips on the top of my head then said,
   úOkay, youôre done.ù</p> <p>úThanks, Dad.ù I jumped off the table. He was
   happy and so was I.</p> <p>I ran out the door to Mrs. Kahnôs house. It
   was right down the block.†Timmy, her son, was in my older sister Carolôs
   class. Timôs dad was a cop. Heôd been shot in the belly by a bad guy and
   still had the bullet in him. He was back at work. I figured, you get
   shot you can retire. Not him.</p> <p>Dad said, úThe reason heôs working
   is the risk of being shot again is better than being home all day with
   his ball-bustinô wife.ù</p> <p>Timmy was a big comic collector. His house
   was filled with them. Every Batman, Superman, Daredevil, he had them
   all. He never played outside ever. When Mrs. Kahn opened the door, I
   could see piles of them.</p> <p>úWow! Timôs got a big collection.ù</p>
   <p>úYes, John. His dad brings them home every night.ù</p> <p>úThatôs neat,ù
   I said. úI wish my dad did that.ù</p> <p>úOh God, John! What happened to
   your hair? Who cut it?ù</p> <p>úMy Dad did.ù I must have looked puzzled.† I
   felt self-conscious. How come sheôs making a big deal about this? I just
   saved seventy-five cents.</p> <p>úCome in, I want you to see it. Did you
   see it?ù</p> <p>I didnôt need to. My Dad did it. I was right there. This
   lady is nuts, I thought. No wonder her husband went back to work.</p>
   <p>She stood me in front of the mirror, holding my shoulders as if I
   was going to faint or something. I noticed a clip of hair on my lip. I
   tongued it into my mouth. It tasted like roach spray.</p> <p>úLook at
   yourself.ù</p> <p>I didnôt look that bad. Sure, it was a little crooked,
   but when I tilted my head, which I did, it looked fine. Yes, there were
   a few unusual deep cuts out of the top, not too bad.</p> <p>She handed
   me a cap and said, úPut this on, no one will notice. Itôs a shame he did
   that to you. Was he drunk?ù</p> <p>I shook my head. úMy Dad donôt drink,ù I
   lied. But the truth was, he was what my friends called úshitfaced.ù</p>
   <p>She gave me a double tip. I guess she felt sorry for me. As I ran
   down the block I thought I should have looked at my own mirror in my
   house, but most of them were broken.</p> <p>It took an hour to get the
   five blocks done. I got home and ran in. Off came the hat.</p> <p>Mom
   saw me. úJesus Christ, what the hell happened to you?ù</p> <p>úNothing, I
   just went collecting.ù</p> <p>úWho did that to you?ù I couldnôt believe she
   had to ask me, with all my hair under her shoes and on the table and
   chair behind her.</p> <p>Mom got up and walked into Dadôs room. There
   was a lot of screaming and yelling. Then she came into the kitchen. She
   handed me a dollar. úGo get it fixed.ù</p> <p>úWhere do I go?ù</p> <p>úGo to
   the Mirrors.ù</p> <p>The Mirrors was the neighborhood barber shop. It
   was near the projects where the blacks lived.</p> <p>As I walked out, I
   thought about how if I ran into any black guys down there I should
   apologize to them about how their leader got killed. I figured they
   would be sad like we were when Kennedy got killed by the
   government.</p> <p>I was in front of the candy store. There were no
   blacks. I was around the block from the barbershop when an older kid I
   knew stopped me. His name was Tommy Thomas. He had been caught for
   purse snatching. It was written up in the papers I delivered. He was
   tall with greasy stringy blond hair. Tommy wore a tee shirt and had
   needle marks on his arms with ripped jeans and sneakers. He had those
   sky blue junkie eyes that were always half closed.</p> <p>He saw me and
   called me over. úI need a favor. You gotta go in the candy store and get
   me a model airplane. Pick any one you want. Keep the plane, but you
   gotta give me the glue.ù</p> <p>úSure, no problem.ù He wanted to sniff it.
   I had sniffed glue before, but never bought it.</p> <p>He gave me two
   bucks. úThe fifty cent change is for you. Donôt forget the glue, he wonôt
   sell it to me.ù</p> <p>I walked in and looked up on the counter. The
   store smelled like a candy factory, sweet. It ate me up. I stared into
   the bright ceiling light. It was like a movie set.</p> <p>The guy
   behind the cash register stared. úCan I help you?ù</p> <p>úSure, Iôd like a
   model airplane.ù</p> <p>He studied me like a cop. úOh yeah? How long you
   been building them?ù</p> <p>I didnôt know what to say, so I pulled off my
   hat. He saw my head and was distracted. He shook his head at me,
   looking sorry.</p> <p>úGive me that one,ù I pointed. úAnd donôt forget the
   glue.ù</p> <p>His head whipped back at me like it was spring loaded. He
   looked around the store and barked, úWhoôs this for?ù</p> <p>I smiled. úMe.
   My Dad got drunk and messed my hair up. He wants to make up for it.
   Okay? Or do you want him to come in here and give you a haircut? Heôs in
   the bar on the corner. Want me to get him?ù</p> <p>I walked out of the
   store and followed Tommy to the back alley across from the barbershop.
   I gave him the glue and held the plane. He squirted it into a small
   bag, brought it to his mouth and nose and started sniffing. After a
   minute, he held the bag out to me. I smelled it and pushed it back. I
   pulled off my hat.</p> <p>úI got enough problems,ù I said.</p> <p>úHoly
   shit,ù he laughed, úA fuckinô butcher job you got.ù</p> <p>I wanted to take
   a sniff to feel better, but didnôt want to turn out like him. I put my
   hat back on as he melted down the wall, his back against it. He started
   to take a few more huffs.</p> <p>úSee ya later,ù I said.</p> <p>I walked
   across the street with my glue-less model air plane under my arm. When
   I opened the door to the barbershop, the bells chimed. The smell of
   hair tonic was in the air. There were a few people ahead of me. I
   picked up a Sports Illustrated and next to it I noticed a Playboy
   Magazine. I quickly grabbed it and laid it inside and opened it. It
   said úHoliday Issue.ù There were plenty of naked women inside.</p> <p>The
   barber yanked it out of my hand. In a thick Italian accent he said, úYou
   no eighteen.ù</p> <p>úSo?ù I said. úWhy do you have them here if I canôt
   look?ù</p> <p>He shoved the sports magazine back at me. † He went back to
   the kid whose hair he was cutting. Every time I looked over, he was
   giving me the evil eye.† I was getting nervous. Even when I looked up
   above me, I could see him staring. The place was covered in mirrors.
   Finally it was my turn.</p> <p>úOkay kid, youôra next.ù</p> <p>I put the
   model airplane down and sat in the barber seat. I pulled off my cap and
   he stepped back.</p> <p>úYou, geta outa my chair,ù he said.</p> <p>I got
   up. I thought there was a fire or something. úWhatôs wrong?ù</p> <p>úI donôt
   wanna geta sued.ù</p> <p>úI need a haircut, or my Momôs going to be mad. I
   canôt go back home without it fixed. Iôm going to be in trouble.ù</p>
   <p>He came over to me and pointed. úIôm not touching that head with a ten
   foot pole.ù</p> <p>I looked at him, knowing that if I went home now my
   Dad would be pissed cause my mother would be bitching at him.</p>
   <p>úYou bringa back your momma or papa,ù he said.</p> <p>So I left. When
   I got back to the house, Mom looked at me. úWhat happened to your
   haircut?ù</p> <p>úHe wouldnôt do it, he said he was going to get sued or
   something.ù</p> <p>Mom looked at my older sister Mary. úYou take him back
   and get him his haircut now.ù</p> <p>I walked back into the barbershop
   with Mary. She acted like my mom.† He stopped us at the door.</p> <p>úIôma
   not a cutting his hair, heôs going getta me in a trouble.ù</p> <p>úWell,
   if you donôt cut my hair, my Dad is going to come in here and beat you
   up. Heôs in the corner bar.ù I said.</p> <p>Mary said, úPlease cut his
   hair.ù</p> <p>Finally the other barber pulled me into his chair.† I sat
   down.</p> <p>úThere is only one way to fix this,ù he said.</p> <p>I
   watched as he grabbed a big electric razor and started to buzz me. A
   shiver went up my spine from the vibration of the razor on my neck. I
   was getting a crew cut without my permission.</p> <p>I pulled away.
   úHey, what the hell!ù</p> <p>úIt will grow back, kid.ù</p> <p>Mary was
   smiling. I was so pissed. A crew cut. I hated him. I wanted to burn the
   store down. He made me look how I usually felt. Ugly.</p> <p>úYouôre a
   dick,ù I said as I walked out.</p> <p>When I got home, Dad was standing
   there. úNow thatôs what I call a GI haircut. You finally look human.ù</p>
   <p>My sister Sara started to laugh. Carol grabbed me and rubbed my head
   for good luck. I took the hat Mrs. Kahn gave me and ran down the street
   to put it in her mailbox.</p> <p>Later that night I went back to the
   barbershop with a mason brick in my hand. I was scared because I had to
   walk past the creepy old cemetery. I thought ghosts lived there.† I
   looked around and as I ran by, I fast pitched it underhand through the
   barbershop window.</p> <p>The smash was tremendous. Like an explosion.
   I ran my ass off.</p> <p>As I turned the corner, I saw Tommy Thomas
   leaning against a building on the nod.</p> <p>I stopped. úHey, Tommy.ù He
   looked up. úYou better get moving. Theyôre rioting on the corner. The
   fuzz are coming.ù</p> <p>I kept running. At least I had warned him. When
   the cops came by they wouldnôt grab him.</p> <p>I never went to the
   Mirrors again. But I kept delivering papers.</p> <p>***</p>

   /><br /> My dad reached inside the closet for his new jacket, single
   breasted, two button, and straight off the rack. It was pencil gray
   with flecks of black in it and may have had those professorial looking
   patches on the sleeves, but Iôm not sure. He didnôt care much about
   clothes and the jacket was nothing special. úSee this baby?ù he said,
   holding it by its hanger. úThis is the coat Iôll be buried in.ù He gave it
   a quick once-over before putting it back. úA little tight in the chest
   though.ù</p> <p>I told him not to worry. Once he was in the ground he
   was bound to drop a few pounds. úPretty soon, itôll be hanging off your
   shoulders.ù We had a good laugh. The man was only two decades older than
   me. He wasnôt going anywhere. But still, he didnôt like getting older and
   was referencing his mortality way too often. úYour momôs ninety-four,ù I
   assured him. úYouôll cruise straight through your eighties.ù Heôd smile
   back and shake his head.</p> <p>In my classroom I keep a calendar that
   my students use to track time, field trips, vacations, and birthdays,
   marking off the days until something special arrives. For the past
   three months Iôve been doing it, too, counting up while they counted
   down, penciling in a number at the top of every box. On January 2nd, Iôd
   rushed from my classroom in Jamaica, Queens to Brookdale Hospital. When
   I returned, the calendar and blackboard still read January 2nd, as if
   my classroom had frozen until I returned. As of right now, my fatherôs
   been dead for ninety days.</p> <p>Thereôs no reason to mark time when
   the final number is forever, but I do it anyway, a tiny stab of pain
   every time the pencil touches paper. My dad suffered an unexpected,
   massive heart attack at work. Iôve heard people call this the
   widow-maker and thatôs exactly what it did.</p> <p>My father had looked
   good at his wake, his casket flanked by flowered wreaths. A tight band
   of matriarchs, aunts, cousins, and godmothers, had come forward to make
   sure that every detail was perfect. He was laid out in his new sports
   jacket, black tie, and the crisp, white oxford shirt Iôd purchased at a
   nearby mall. The beard heôd worn since he left the military was neatly
   trimmed, a set of rosary beads draped across his hands.</p> <p>There
   was one other detail that stood out, something that set off a wave of
   magical thinking thatôs often needed at times like these. Somehow the
   right side of my fatherôs sealed lips had been curved into a smile,
   something one might find on a sly, cartoon fox or rascally rabbit, a
   guy who was pleased with things, a man who knew that everything would
   be alright. I watched loved ones approach his casket, gesture to his
   face, and smile back. There was no smile, of course, just some happy
   accident that brought us comfort or perhaps the latest fad in mortuary
   science. Maybe some hotshot embalmer was leaving wry grins as a
   trademark to show off his skills. It made my mother happy, though, so
   weôll call it a smile.</p> <p>Weôd always been affectionate, but had
   never really touched. Those barriers fell away the moment heôd died. In
   the hospital Iôd peppered his forehead with kisses, wiped some blood
   from his lips, and cried into his already pale face. I continued
   touching him throughout his wake, stroking his beard and rubbing his
   chest.</p> <p>Conversation swirled about the room as I tended to the
   casket. Oddly enough, the surreal, cocktail party atmosphere of a
   traditional Catholic wake can be comforting. The place had a good buzz,
   family and friends catching up, making sure my mother was never alone.
   Amidst the scattered assemblies stood a large, older man with powerful
   looking shoulders and a stoic face I recalled from the eighties. We
   tend to forget how young these athletes are when they retire from their
   sport. This guy couldôve cleared the room with a raised eyebrow. I didnôt
   know him, but he looked intelligent and kind, placid as he stood just a
   few feet away.</p> <p>No one in my immediate family had ever met Marty
   Lyons, former New York Jets great and noted humanitarian. He was a
   friend of my auntôs family and was here to pay his respects to them.
   Lyons was a key member of the New York Jets Sack Exchange, along with
   Abdul Salaam, Mark Gastineau, and Joe Klecko, a defensive line so
   fierce it caused the NFL to start counting quarterback sacks as a
   statistic. As I stole glances his way, I realized he was the only
   member Iôd never met. His presence at the wake flooded me again with
   boyhood memories of sports and my dad.</p> <p>An eighties childhood on
   Long Island was idyllic, although somewhat limiting for kids not yet
   old enough to drive. Iôd often come home from team practice just to play
   more sports until dark. We kept hearing about some idiocy called
   fireball, a demented version of dodgeball where every player was
   already a loser, and was compelled to try it. Simply dip some tennis
   balls in gas, light them on fire, and let the fun begin. During the
   hysteria of swatting and kicking explosives at my best pals, a ball
   stuck to the top of my right sneaker, singeing quickly through its mesh
   and leaving a gaping hole. I got so panicked I ended up burying it in
   the backyard without a second pair. The next day at Little League, all
   eyes were on the kid digging into the mound in a pair of brown
   loafers.</p> <p>My father arrived from work to see his son pitching in
   church shoes. When irritated, the Long Island accent would get thicker.
   úBryan, what-da-hell-iz-is? Whereôs da sneakas we jusô ga-choo..?ù</p>
   <p>My father rooted for me to succeed until the moment his heart
   stopped beating. I am the proverbial fortunate son.</p> <p>I eventually
   went over to Marty Lyons and introduced myself. We shook hands and I
   thanked him for coming. He left having no clue what an important family
   circle heôd helped me complete. All it took was one retired, defensive
   lineman to kick start a wave of emotions I hadnôt considered in years. I
   was very pleased that heôd been here. Later, I smoothed the lapels of my
   fatherôs suit and spoke to him for the last time. úYou see that? A Jet
   was here. Ninety-three from the Sack Exchange¶ù My dad smiled.</p> <p>He
   continued to smile as the lid of his casket was closed and then
   transported to Calverton National Cemetery, where my mother was
   presented with the American flag. Then my fatherôs body would be placed
   into the Long Island soil, wearing his new sports jacket forever.</p>

   important to him that we maintain a good reputation. Heôd take me ice
   skating so we could take nice photos, the kinds that people who love
   each other take. I hated ice skating, but Iôd pose for him anyway.
   Later, Iôd edit all the photos on a nondescript app from China,
   methodically blurring out his blackheads and enlarging my chest until
   we looked perfect.<span class="Apple-converted-space">†</span></p> <p>I
   met Gabe in 2014 a month before he fucked his neighbor. I was standing
   in a crowded backyard with the rest of the ninth grade as we took shots
   from someoneôs dadôs liquor stash to celebrate the end of the school
   year. Gabe was drunk before sunset and his personality was mainly
   comprised of him casually mentioning his six-pack abs, but he was a boy
   and was taller than me. He asked me to úget some airù with him, so I
   went.</p> <p>I studied him as he stood beside me. I wasnôt particularly
   attracted to him. He had an acne problem, and his lips were wide and
   flat in the way that a toadôs would be if toads had lips. But he played
   floor hockey and he told me that he liked my eyeliner. Actually, he
   said my eyeliner was <i>hot</i>. Iôd never been called hot before.</p>
   <p>I wondered if I liked him. His spelling was atrocious, his breath
   always smelled of pizza, and we didnôt share many interests î honestly, I
   didnôt know what his interests were. But I wasnôt much of a catch either,
   and he liked me. He called me pretty, and put his arm around me in
   public. I was fat and annoying and bit my nails. He settled for me, so
   I settled for him. Relationships are about sacrifice.</p> <p>I didnôt
   tell Gabe that Iôd overheard him. Telling him would have meant that we
   would break up, and I didnôt want to break up. Iôd never been called hot
   before, especially by someone with a six-pack. I swallowed the
   humiliation. Relationships are about sacrifice.</p> <p>Four days after
   we met, Gabe said he had to ask me a question. We went to the only
   place in town that sold something resembling good ice cream. He had a
   milkshake and I had nothing, insisting I had újust eatenù and úno, really,
   Iôm fine.ù I waited for him to insist on buying me something and to tell
   me that I was so skinny that I needed to eat, but he didnôt. When he
   asked me to be his girlfriend, he put his enormous hands on the small
   of my back and held me. I felt an unfamiliar tugging in my chest and
   thought it might be love.</p> <p>I left for summer camp in the
   Catskills the next week, just like I did every year. There was a strict
   ban on electronics, but I was greeted each morning at breakfast with a
   letter from my parents. I waited for one from Gabe, but he didnôt send
   any. I told myself he was busy; I told my bunkmates he missed me.</p>
   <p>Gabe was back home, working as a lifeguard at a day camp in the
   Rockaways. When weôd first spoken, heôd told me he was worried about
   making friends there. I knew someone else working there î Hannah, from
   my geometry class. I didnôt know her last name at the time. Iôd
   introduced them. Her house was just around the corner from his.</p>
   <p>My fifteenth birthday was on the twenty-third, and his was
   twenty-three days later. I took this as a sign î of what, Iôm not
   entirely sure. I wanted to make some sort of grand gesture for his
   birthday, something to show how much I loved him. I decided Iôd steal my
   counselorôs phone and call him. I plotted for a week. My bunkmates
   waited with excited anticipation.</p> <p>July 16th came, and I was
   ready. After dinner, we returned to the bunk for evening clean-up. I
   folded the same sweater for minutes on end while keeping a close eye on
   the counselor. Finally, she went to the bathroom, abandoning the phone
   on her bed. I shoved it into my back pocket and bolted.</p> <p>I dashed
   through the woods, mud from the previous dayôs thunderstorm slipping
   into my flip-flops. Finally, the phone buzzed. I had a signal. Digging
   out the wrinkled Post-It Note that Iôd written his number on, I
   dialed.</p> <p>He didnôt pick up. A robot informed me that his voicemail
   box had not been set up yet.</p> <p>Maybe he was still at work? No, it
   was almost 8:00 pm. I figured he didnôt know Iôd be calling. So I dialed
   again. He didnôt answer. Shit.</p> <p>I was running out of time. Iôd try
   one more time, and then if that didnôt work, Iôd text him, maybe. Itôd be
   better than nothing.</p> <p>I dialed again. It rang. It rang again. And
   then clicked. Yes.</p> <p>úGabey!ù I exhaled. úItôs me, itôs Abbyîù</p>
   <p>There was noise coming from his end, but it was muffled,
   staticky.</p> <p>úGabey, I canôt hear youîù</p> <p>It was clearer now. He
   was sitting on his phone, I think. He was in some sort of position that
   had allowed him to accidentally answer a phone call. He was talking to
   somebody, maybe? I couldnôt tell. Someone else was there. .</p> <p>Then
   I heard her.</p> <p>She was moaning. She was moaning, and then he was,
   too, he was saying, úGod, Hannah, youôre so fucking hot,ù and then she was
   saying his name, and I was listening to him fuck her from two hundred
   miles away. My toes curled into the mud and I held a hand over my mouth
   so I wouldnôt scream and clutched the phone to my ear like it was the
   last thing I had left and I waited for them to finish, and I waited for
   them to finish, and I waited for them to finish because he had never,
   not once, done to me what he was doing to her. He had never fucked me
   because I had never let him, no matter how much he begged or pushed or
   threatened. So o<i>f course </i>he was fucking her. She had given him
   what I wouldnôt. I waited for them to finish.</p> <p>It took a few
   minutes. He grunted, then sighed, then grunted again. I hung up and
   walked silently back to the bunkhouse. I wondered if he loved her. I
   wondered if he loved me.</p> <p>I never told Gabe that Iôd heard
   him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">† </span>I didnôt want us to
   fight. I was afraid of him. Heôd once told me that a friend of his î I
   think his name was Jeremy î had sent around an ex-girlfriendôs nude
   photos after theyôd broken up. úYouôre lucky I love you so much,ù Gabe had
   told me. úI would never do that to you.ù I remembered Jeremy telling his
   girlfriend that heôd loved her too.</p> <p>I arrived at the bunkhouse.
   The counselor had been looking for her phone. I threw it back. Sorry, I
   said. It was a prank.</p> <p>My bunkmates clustered around my bed,
   eager to hear how my scheme had fared.</p> <p>It went well, I told
   them. He misses me.</p> <p>One month, two weeks, and four days later, I
   called him. Iôd been home from camp for three days, but we hadnôt spoken
   in two. I wasnôt sure why. We hadnôt been fighting. We hadnôt fought
   before. Until now, I guess.</p> <p>I had never told Gabe that Iôd
   overheard him fucking his neighbor. Telling him meant that we would
   break up, and I didnôt want to break up î I wanted to have a boyfriend.
   So I swallowed the information, hoping it would somehow dissolve in the
   acid in the lining of my stomach. But it never dissolved. Instead it
   slowly bubbled its way back up through my esophagus, grungy and
   distorted, manifested as úI think we should see other peopleù and úthis is
   really for the best.ù<span class="Apple-converted-space">†</span></p>
   <p>When I finally puked out the lines Iôd been practicing, he seemed
   unfazed. úOkay.ù</p> <p>úDonôt you want to know why?ù Iôd prepared a whole
   speech.</p> <p>úI mean, sure, I guess.ù</p> <p>My mood dampened. Iôd
   wanted him to fight for me. úYou donôt treat me well,ù I declared, loosely
   regathering some of the confidence Iôd spent a month, two weeks, and
   four days finding. úYouôre a bad boyfriend, and youôre not nice to me.ù</p>
   <p>úOkay.ù</p> <p>Huh. úOkay.ù</p> <p>I hung up.</p> <p><b>***</b></p>

   sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p> <p>One way or another,
   everybody needs to get on the A train.</p> <p>I&#8217;m leaning against
   the back wall of the car, in that tiny corner beside the conductorôs
   compartment, still managing to read despite all the other people
   crammed inside. Itôs the afternoon rush hour and you donôt need a watch
   to tell. The doors open and a horde of humanity forces its way inside.
   Acting as a unified mass of flesh, bags, and overcoats, they push,
   squeezing out every bit of space and oxygen left inside. We are packed
   in tight. Women in skirt suits with sneakers on their feet and high
   heels in their bags; teenagers wearing earbuds, struggling to text with
   their arms against their chests and their phones an inch from their
   faces; businessmen in slacks and sports coats, gripping their
   briefcases as they reach up to the ceiling for balance; an old lady
   with a half empty churro cart, so short her eye line is level with most
   everyone elseôs chest; a busker in skinny jeans and a hoodie, his guitar
   thankfully tucked away in its case; our own little melting pot,
   suffocatingly close and riding the A together on our way uptown.</p>
   <p>Normally I stand sideways by the door, leaning against the partition
   between me and the three-seater behind me, my book bag on the floor
   tucked between my legs. I try to take up as little space as possible,
   but sometimes I get dirty looks anyway. It&#8217;s worth it, though.
   Iôve got a long ride up to 175th Street. Over time Iôve worked out all
   the A train hacks to make the commute bearable. I always run to the
   second car, go through the second set of doors, and take my spot on the
   side that opens at Fulton Street, where I get on. After 34th Street,
   those doors don&#8217;t open again until 168th, giving me a perfect,
   undisturbed reading spot while everyone else is trying to defy the laws
   of physics on the other side of the car. When the doors by me open
   again at 175th Street, I&#8217;m right in front of the stairs nearest
   to the station exit, allowing me to make a run for it before the rest
   of the crowd has decompressed enough to move. Every now and then,
   though, someone else gets the same idea, leaving me to scramble for the
   back corner of the car instead. That&#8217;s how I ended up here. Itôs
   not so bad. Iôll be stuck in the current of the exiting crowd later on,
   but at least I have just enough space to comfortably read.</p> <p>Then,
   I&#8217;m interrupted by a loud noise.</p> <p>BRIIIIIING BRIIIIING
   BRIIIIING! BRIIIING BRIIIING BRIIIING!</p> <p>Startled, I pick my head
   up and dart my eyes around the train car to find it. The sound is
   metallic, piercingly loud, and repeating incessantly.</p> <p>BRIIIIIING
   BRIIIIING BRIIIIING! BRIIIING BRIIIING BRIIIING!</p> <p>Through small
   gaps in the crowd, I manage to spot him. A middle-aged man in a red
   baseball cap and matching sneakers is leaning forward in his middle
   seat, grinning wide and chuckling to himself, completely absorbed in
   the cell phone game he is playing. Whenever he swipes to make his
   character jump to collect coins, the sound returns.</p> <p>BRIIIIIING
   BRIIIIING BRIIIIING! BRIIIING BRIIIING BRIIIING!</p> <p>I sigh and
   shake my head in disapproval. Annoying subway commuters are inevitable:
   the refrigerator-sized dudes who block an entire door and refuse to
   move over, forcing everyone to funnel in through a half-sized opening;
   people who keep wearing their back packs despite the crowd, effectively
   doubling their size and bumping into others whenever they move; and, of
   course, the overstressed, impatient, and possibly insane people who
   pick fights with strangers over minor infractions. But few things are
   more irritating than somebody blasting obnoxious noise from their
   phones with no apparent regard for anyone around them. I try to ignore
   it and keep reading, but find myself going back over the same paragraph
   again and again, unable to register the words, because that fucking
   noise keeps coming back.</p> <p>BRIIIIIING BRIIIIING BRIIIIING!
   BRIIIING BRIIIING BRIIIING!</p> <p>I look up again and see other people
   glaring at the man. No one says a word, but every time the sound blares
   out from his phone again they stare daggers at him, growing more and
   more visibly agitated with every repetition. Their breathing gets
   heavier, they shift uncomfortably in their places, and begin to
   exchange úCan you believe this guy?ù looks with one another. From my
   vantage point at the back of the car, I sense a growing hostility
   thickening an already smothered air between us all, and the beginnings
   of that distinct, powder-keg vibe that seeps into a subway car just
   before a fight breaks out. Meanwhile, the man gleefully swipes on his
   phone, unaware of whatôs going on around him. Iôm too far away to
   contribute any meaningful scorn, so I just watch, bemused at the
   man&#8217;s obliviousness.</p> <p>Finally, he seems to get the hint. I
   watch as he pops his head back to sit straight up, looks around at the
   crowd around him and fidgets with his phone to turn the sound off.
   After a beat he leans forward again, swiping as before, but this time
   with no sound. Slowly, the moment passes, the tension dissipates, and I
   return to my book.</p> <p>Two stops later, itôs back.</p> <p>BRIIIIIING
   BRIIIIING BRIIIIING! BRIIIING BRIIIING BRIIIING!</p> <p>úYouôre shitting
   me¶ù I begin to say as I look up from my book again.</p> <p>Someone else
   had gotten on the train and was playing the exact same cell phone game
   at full volume, swiping up to collect coins and bringing that horrible
   sound back into the car. úJesus, really?ù I mutter, and shake my head in
   disapproval, as does everyone else around meîincluding the man who had
   originally been annoying everyone. My irritated frown slowly morphs
   into an incredulous grin as I watch the man in the red ball cap
   silently condemn the newcomer, with a furious gaze of sanctimony and
   self-righteousness that I canôt help but find hilarious. But heôs not
   joking. Not only is the man annoyed, heôs pulling out all the stops with
   his reaction. With his phone now innocuously tucked inside his pocket,
   he glares at the new guy, breathing heavily, shifting in his seat, and
   exchanging úCan you believe this guy?ù looks with a few baffled people
   standing near him<span class="s1">îforgetting, or pretending to forget,
   that he <i>was</i> that guy, just an eye-blink ago.</span></p> <p>In
   that moment something clicks in my head, and I have to laugh at this
   metaphor in motion. I take another deep breath and, with a smirk, go
   back to my reading.†<span class="s1">It&#8217;s all finally beginning to
   sink in.</span></p> <p>***</p> <p><em><b>Angel Eduardo </b>is a writer,

   Hopper once said that he identified all the places heôd known according
   to their architecture.† I used to be the same way.† I noticed people as
   backdrops to overblown dramas in light and shade.† I looked past them
   toward ogee roof and filigreed transom; I marveled at the heady volumes
   of imagination-translated cubes and cones; I stopped in awe as a
   streetscape spread out from a plaza and faded off into the distance, in
   a smoky haze.</p> <p>A stowaway from the horizontally-captivated South,
   I wandered Manhattanôs grid. It was 1972. I felt the power-laden
   atmosphere from the ground up ì though, walking along Third Avenue, I
   would get homesick for the prairie-like expanses of my suburban milieu
   and feel my tears welling up alongside of a cab stand or manhole cover.
   The density of the place was, by turns, oppressive and exhilarating.† If
   it soared vertically in the third dimension, it didnôt stay that way
   inside of the claustrophobic fibers of the soul.</p> <p>The South I
   knew clustered at the bank of a river, but rivers are not reliable
   things.† They bully, they cut, they meander.† Theyôre tantrum-oriented
   too. Every old-timer has a flood story.† Even if you never have to run
   up to the attic as the water rises, your imagination is haunted by that
   possibility. But the South can offer protection as well. You can still
   hide out in the woods. The act of fleeing somebody down a canyon of
   brick and stone seems riskier ì as it always is in film noir. You find
   an alley ì or go straight to the top. Your options? Death by
   claustrophobia or a miscalculated jump.</p> <p>To return to Hopper: he
   and a friend were downtown and happened to notice a cluster of
   skyscrapers framed by shipping-age remnants that were likely to be
   toppled at any moment. When his friend started to rhapsodize about the
   skyscrapers, Hopper shrugged his shoulders and said he preferred the
   dinkier buildings that clustered at its base &#8211; the human scale
   exemplified by row-house and tenement.† Having worked my way down
   Manhattan from the great, early 20th-century towers to the tin cornices
   and tarpaper roofs of the Ashcan era, I understand what he meant. I
   watched whole blocks of tenements come down all over Midtown ì great
   parcels of two-story buildings that had served generations of
   store-keepers and restaurateurs.† I walked the old Tenderloin, where the
   demi-monde of the Weber and Fields era posed unwittingly for William
   Glackens and John Sloan.† I stood outside of the tacky, new Penn Station
   and tried to imagine the old one there ì an American version of a Roman
   bathhouse disgorging and receiving miniature humans.† George Bellows had
   painted it as a yawning gorge; innumerable observers after him tried to
   make sense of its heroic scale and heart-breaking presence.†
   Photo-diaries of its destruction became my personal library. Iôd go to
   my small room at the Y and pore over these photographs, trying to
   conceive of a civic intelligence that would condemn and replace it. I
   was not accustomed to considering the utility of an object.† If it
   served a higher (read: aesthetic) function, that was enough; this
   quality justified its continuing existence. These days, I think the
   opposite; any building that sits on property that is potentially more
   valuable has, for better or worse, a shelf-life, a sell-by date. The
   economic system that creates it will ultimately determine how long it
   manages to stick around. Brendan Gill said that his efforts as a
   preservationist went unnoticed because whatever is saved is ústill
   there.ù It must be a thankless job, to save something that shouldnôt, in
   a better world, need saving. You hit the home run nobody ever sees.</p>
   <p>In my search for the usable past, I went as far up as the GW Bridge
   and sat underneath it on jutting rocks spattered with the silver paint
   that made it look like steel from a distance.† I toured Gramercy Park
   &#8211; that almost-gated community sandwiched between Lexington Avenue
   and Irving Place. Here two warring centuries had laid down their arms
   and walked together, admiring what man could do with chunks of
   brownstone, marble and wrought iron. There was the fine old hotel where
   S. J. Perelman stayed when he wasnôt in Rangoon; obsolete clubhouses
   frequented by hyphenated men of the theatre; and art-filled mansions
   Hollywood might care to use for The House of Mirth. On the east side of
   the park were a few New Orleans-style townhouses that had been grafted ì
   strange party animals at a black-tie dinner &#8211; onto a more stately
   progression of aldermanic úproperty.ù† I was struck by their out-of-place
   frivolity, their light-hearted tampering with a well-established form.†
   This was something New Orleans (as I would later find) was good at.† New
   York, even at its genteel best, was too starchy, and too, by New
   Orleansô standards, puritanical.</p> <p>I took the A-train up to The
   Cloisters, conscious of making a pilgrimage that wouldnôt ultimately
   thrill me. I felt the way a potential donor must: obliged.† Paying
   homage is a spontaneous sort of thing and shouldnôt be hitched to the
   notion of having to.† I never have, and probably never will, like such
   places. They are essentially mausoleums, tended by architectural
   guardians who let respectful observers in and out, but are otherwise
   intolerant of human dereliction, human noise. The Met I did like. There
   you felt small, but you mattered; its grandeur rubbed off on you, made
   you larger somehow. You walked underneath its vaulted spaces and
   developed a religious connection to the art of the past. You came to
   appreciate its far-sighted protectors, who had built such a monument to
   house it all. You went there all the time, if only to be part of the
   best civilization had to offer.† And if you didnôt want to pay anything,
   you bloody well didnôt.† You got your little color-coded pin and were set
   for the whole day if thatôs how long you wanted to stick around.</p>
   <p>There was a German neighborhood east of the museum, from Lexington
   down to York Avenue. There you could buy exquisite little pastries
   served ì if you were lucky ì by perfect little Aryan goddesses.† It was
   inside of a spun-sugar storefront on East 81st that I fell victim to a
   coup de foudre of gigantic, pre-adult proportions. There she was, in a
   poufy blouse tied at the waist, exuding her carefully made,
   almond-scented world: a world of caramel-colored woodwork and
   confectionary frills. When she straightened up, she assumed a ramrod
   posture that seemed totally natural. It was the way she presented
   herself to customers.† How captivating! I thought, as she went toward
   another customer with a gauzy little serving-tray. I couldnôt say
   anything except to order úthat.ù† úThatù was all I could say to her. úThis?ù
   she asked me in a supple voice.† úYes, this,ù I said, thrilled to be
   repeating a word sheôd said.† úThis is it, then,ù she told me, reaching for
   the thing I wanted. I left with a stolen glimpse of her turning around
   toward a sideboard from whose coffee-urn she drew a steaming cup. Then
   she flipped a switch and looked out toward me. There she was,
   surrounded by a velvety darkness borrowed from a fin de siËcle
   photograph. I was thrilled in a way I cannot, even now, understand. Yet
   I do know this: I had become so comfortable with the inanimate that any
   human attraction could disorient me.† Or maybe I was merely dumbstruck,
   as many young men have been before, at the sight of a woman who would
   be forever out of reach. Those comfortable with the inanimate come to
   know this feeling intimately.</p> <p>I took whatever it was I ordered ì
   úthatù ì back to my room at the Y.† I never ate it.† When it had dried out,
   I folded it into the fluted napkin sheôd served it on and left it out in
   the kitchen.</p> <p>Some years later&#8211;I believe it was
   1976&#8211;when I was in New Orleans, and an artist wannabe, I was
   still looking out at cornices and rooflines, though Iôd acquired a tad
   more comfort with human attractions. Walking miles and miles from my
   home-base in the Quarter, I was able to restrain the impulse to keep
   walking in order to stand almost perfectly still near a Creole-era
   mansion or iron-trimmed oyster-bar and work on my chops with charcoal
   and conte crayon. The drawings I would do piled up on the floor of a
   two-room apartment that provided me and my friend, Tom, with only the
   most perfunctory protection from the outside world. We traded off
   sleeping-places, so that neither of us would roast in the still and
   humid air. The little couch near our screen door was almost tolerable,
   in that it afforded some small access to circulating air ì to air that
   moved. Whoever slept úin backù dragged through his restaurant job with
   more grit than consciousness and was glad to switch place the next
   night. When youôre fairly young, you donôt quantify rest the way
   middle-aged people do. Weôre not úrightù unless we get a full eight hours;
   some of us can even make do with seven. But in the small street-level
   apartmentôs totally humidified cosmos, sleep deprivation was so constant
   that one of us always seemed to be crashed out on the sofa at odd
   hours, catching up.† Whoever tiptoed in through the screen door did it
   very carefully.</p> <p>Itôs odd to think that we had only that screen
   door between us and the rampant criminality we mostly ignored. Once,
   when I had the sofa, I looked up to see the image of a curious observer
   occupying the breadth of the screen. As I began to sit up, he grew
   larger for a moment as he moved in for a closer look at his subject,
   then fled. I mentioned it the next day; ever the humorist, my friend
   Tom said heôd take care to latch the door.† úYou can never be too careful,ù
   he observed.† In our case, ignorance protected ì though it wouldnôt
   always.</p> <p><img class="alignleft wp-image-10087 size-large"

   broken in while in New York City were brought to slovenly perfection in
   New Orleans. Unlike Manhattan, which is cooled, if not always
   freshened, by its rivers, New Orleans has an airflow problem. The city
   was barraged, in equal measure, with sunlight and sulphur; with
   otherworldly fragrance and ungodly stink.† A rancid odor seemed to be
   present in all man-made things; it had seeped into every vestibule,
   which exhaled it out; it had found a trusting environment in the wide
   banquettes that helped make the French Quarter a walking city and
   suspired from it every hour of every day; it was welcome in bar-rags
   and table-linen which breathed it out when you sat down on in front of
   a Budweiser or among other alfresco diners. I thought it possible to
   draw these things and wanted desperately for my work to not only
   reflect the visible, but have a kind of second or third gear: a sensual
   quality, a capacity for evoking smell as well as sight; for snagging
   senses as yet unknown. With this particular quest of mine, Tom was both
   sympathetic and encouraging. Yet we could be brought up short by
   fiercer yearnings, sensual challenges to the monkish disciplines we had
   imposed upon ourselves and had, for the most part, accepted. We were
   walking down Dumaine Street one day when I noticed a young girl in
   front of a building whose textural nuances she easily trumped. úThe life
   force has triumphed! The flesh has won!ù Tom exclaimed audibly enough
   for her and perhaps every other unaccompanied female in the Quarter to
   hear. We both watched the girl recede into the distance. I soon went
   back to my textural nuances; he to his musicology and theatre
   studies.</p> <p>I should recall something Tom and I experienced at
   different times. He and I were drawn to the same sort of melancholy
   places New Orleans ì celebrated for its Good Times &#8211; doesnôt want
   to acknowledge.† Both on my own, and in his company, we went in search
   for the wonderfully decrepit and strangely overwrought. We searched out
   good, gentle people who could tell you stories of a rule-bound,
   family-oriented past ì but we liked to break òem up with earthier folk
   who liked smashing things over peoplesô heads.† Being young and fairly
   directionless ì unless you want to think of our hunger as an organizing
   principle ì our mostly solitary travels were unplanned. I had a penchant
   for the industrial and followed it past the Quarter into the Uptown
   area, where on Camp, Magazine, and Poydras Streets I studied the
   architectural face of a brutally vigorous expansion of known and
   beloved territory. I studied the fine old granite piers that had
   supported pre-Civil War commerce; I gaped at the fabulously oversized
   cobblestones that mustôve been hell on horses; I drank in the
   color-shifts of iron-infused and magnesium-tinted brick.† I watched
   crabbed working-stiffs return at dusk from factory-jobs that our
   service economy has no doubt gutted; I stood off to the side as a black
   guy and a white guy traded insults verbally, then started to knock the
   shit out of each other with their fists; I whistled in wonder at the
   silhouette of a hundred nineteenth-century facades that tumbled away
   from me as I walked. At Lee Circle, I turned and walked toward the
   river, where Terpsichore Street yielded Italianate splendor; Poydras
   made my heart sink with its solitary live oaks; on Tchopitoulous I
   stood behind a row of down-at-heel shops and concentrated on the slave
   quarters in back. These were the barracks of a city whose grace and
   sophistication needed backup ì or, rather, backbone. I was getting my
   chops out there. I thought a drawing could do as much as a good story
   could if you could just get the subject down in all of its vast
   interconnections: of human history, of natural growth and decay; of
   everything that did happen, could happen, and might happen to it. A
   tall order, but I thought, at times, that I might eventually be up to
   it. I popped into the galleries on Royal Street, unimpressed by their
   pictorially conservative, but uniformly costly, wares. There was a
   print gallery that had everybody. I pored over Martin Lewis and Stow
   Wegenroth in little plastic sleeves, much to the† annoyance of the
   proprietor.</p> <p>I worked through fatigue, sexual frustration, and
   the momentary despair that finds you even when youôre feeling better
   than youôve ever felt.† Yet it gets in as a splinter will. You know what
   it is, however, and if you can stand the pain, you can yank it right
   out.† I was training myself to be an anachronism ì at least in the art
   world of that day.</p> <p>But back to our story:</p> <p>On one of those
   sultry days, when I was lurking around Magazine Street, I poked into a
   nondescript sort of building that had been connected to the restaurant
   trade.† There was some evidence of it still: steel sinks that looked
   almost brand-new; floor-bound refrigerators whose tops slid open;
   shallow tubs that fit into a steam-table. Iôd always been susceptible to
   open doors and could hardly ever resist any opportunity to go in them ì
   no matter what possible danger might lurk beyond.† I entered through the
   front ì a risky thing to do in those days.† If somebody sees you go in,
   they can go in right after you.† And if their intentions are violent,
   theyôve got you cornered. I thought about all this only in the abstract.
   The need to be in there was paramount.</p> <p>Careening my way around
   the refrigerators, I found a series of smaller rooms, into which moody,
   courtroom-style shafts of yellow sunlight penetrated. These rooms were
   littered with old invoices and perky calendars. Order blanks spilled
   from file cabinets that would have looked new in Omaha, but had become
   New Orleans-rancid. After searching other, similar rooms, I settled on
   the first and started drawing. When you draw something youôre like a
   doughy creature that ordinarily lives in the protective spiral of a
   sea-shell, coming out of that shell and entering into a world that can
   crush or eat you. Time disappears; you occupy a nano-space without
   fixed boundaries.† Itôs powered by a willing imagination and limited by
   hunger-pangs, the sudden craving for a human presence, and a bodily
   perception of something wrong in the air &#8211; which may or may not
   include a dangerous person.</p> <p>I was lucky; I had a wall behind me;
   you need a wall behind you when youôre drawing ì something you can back
   into that wonôt yield.</p> <p>When I was done, I made my way across the
   room and down a musty corridor.† Blocking this corridor was a man whose
   face I donôt remember and is not important. He was standing there, in my
   right of way, putting on a pair of plastic gloves. One glove was
   already on by the time I saw him and was moving in his direction. The
   other he was stretching out, as if to flex a stiffened muscle. He was
   not surprised to see me; heôd possibly watched me come in and had been
   waiting. As I approached, he kept his little ritual going. If Iôd
   hesitated, he mightôve closed in on me, but whatever gut instinct had
   survived my etherealized immersion in that small room told me to go
   forward, past him and to the door, where I could easily break into a
   run if I had to. Oddly enough, he let me sidle by him, as if I were
   someone who wasnôt needed at the moment ì someone who was just passing
   through and should have his space. When I got out the door, I broke
   into a run that was a hundred percent raw nerves. I ran in order to put
   distance between us; I ran because Iôd come out of a dark place into the
   light and wanted to fill my lungs with it; I ran because I could.</p>
   <p>I would leave the city that autumn, promising guiltily to return. Iôd
   never paid a dime for that porous little place where we lived, and felt
   I ought to.† It was old and needed a paint-job very badly.</p> <p>I
   never have returned ì though I was scheduled to fly there a few days
   before Katrina when the floodwaters spilled over Lake Pontchartrain and
   breached those two, Category Three-proof levees. Iôve been thinking
   again of New Orleans; of its architecture soaking in water and of its
   people living there today. After Katrina, people drifted back to
   water-logged kitchens and living-rooms, and the ragged contours of the
   place reappeared. Yet the putrid social order that allowed the
   well-heeled to skedaddle while leaving everybody else high, if not dry,
   is still in place. The city has staggered back to life even as it
   courts its own destruction. The cycle of flood and recovery continues.†
   I learned in New Orleans that architecture never matters as much ì in
   spite of my earlier thesis ì as the people it contains. Without them,
   there is no context. There is a way out, but no way in.</p> <p>I need
   to go back there and work again, now that I am a grown person and can
   pace myself. I need to go back and see whether hallucination can be a

   1960s, the address was plastered in thousands of comic books and
   magazines. The 12-story building, constructed in 1913, housed the
   offices of Angelo Siciliano, better known as Charles Atlas. It was at
   this location that Atlas sold millions of his 15-minute a day úDynamic
   Tensionù body-building exercise programs, promising to turn 97-pound
   weaklings into new men.</p> <p>The year was 1967. I didnôt weigh
   97-pounds in my early teens, but nevertheless I clipped and sent the
   coupon to Charles Atlas. It didnôt take long to receive the first of
   several mailings. The details are fuzzy, but I remember the price of
   the course decreased with each successive mailing. When it seemed that
   Iôd been offered the rock bottom price, I convinced my parents to spring
   for the program.</p> <p>Living on Long Island at the time, New York
   City was only a stoneôs throw away. Soon more parental badgering ensued.
   úI want to visit Charles Atlas,ù I pleaded. It took months to convince
   them, but they finally acquiesced after a friend of mine, another
   Charles Atlas úDynamic Tensionù customer, received the go-ahead from his
   folks. We took the train into the city, arrived at 115 East 23rd
   Street, and entered. I donôt know what I expected to see, but I remember
   getting off the elevator, and immediately being in a reception area. We
   explained to the woman at the front desk that we wanted to see Charles
   Atlas. She grinned, said that Mr. Atlas wasnôt there and that this was
   simply an office where they processed mail. We were out of there in
   less than a minute. I was fine with that, and have accepted the
   experience for the last five decades. Recently though, my head came out
   of the sand (the same sand bullies kicked in my face). I realized my
   friend and I got the short shrift.</p> <p>In doing research for this
   piece, I came upon a <em>New York Daily News</em> article written by
   Jay Maeder, dated May 16, 1999. Maeder wrote, &#8220;Youngsters would
   make pilgrimages to the Atlas offices at 115 E. 23rd St., and Charles
   Atlas would always find a minute or two to bend a railroad spike and
   offer sound counsel (Live clean, think clean and don&#8217;t go to
   burlesque shows). What the¶?</p> <p>Charles Atlas passed away in 1972.
   His highly popular úDynamic Tensionù fitness program is still available,
   but no longer is it located at 115 East 23rd Street. The building now
   houses a physical therapy company. Next-door is a New York Sports

   seventh grade. Not to form sentences, but to know and use my voice on
   paper, and to hope I would be heard. It was 1969: Nixon was president
   and I had a new teacher: a 26-year-old draft evader named Robert Rusch.
   He was six feet four and, moreover, wore cowboy boots. He had a red
   beard. He took us on class trips to the Apollo theater and Black
   Panther headquarters. He read aloud to us from <i>Catcher in the
   Rye</i> and <i>Manchild in the Promised Land</i>. He drew a diagram on
   the blackboard depicting the typical location of the clitoris. And, on
   the first day of school, he handed out a pile of 50-page notebooks with
   blue cardboard covers and told us our homework for the rest of the year
   was to write in them every day.</p> <p>The whole schoolîWoodward, it was
   calledîwas weird. We did not focus on academic achievement but on
   brotherhood. Every grade had a single teacher for almost all subjects,
   and there were no report cards or tests. We were protected from
   strategy, competition, and complacency, and we studied slavery,
   concentration camps, the Trail of Tears, McCarthyism, and other hideous
   things. Instead of gym we had úyard,ù during which we played a version of
   soccer with no positionsînot even úoffenseù and údefense.ù Iôm still not sure
   what the point of that was supposed to be. Isnôt úyardù what exercise is
   called in prison? When it rained, we learned international folk dances
   and sang Woody Guthrie songs. My best friend at Woodward was Amy Stein.
   She lived in Midwood, in a house with marble floors and nubbed-silk
   couches. By the front door was a cut-glass dish of sugarless candies
   that no one ever seemed to eat. Amy and I had a sleepover date at her
   house at the end of August, after I came back from camp and she from
   úthe country.ù The point was to catch up on any important changes in each
   otherôs lives so we could begin the school year in solidarity. We tossed
   around terms like úsolidarityù and úrelevanceù all the time in those
   days.<span class="Apple-converted-space">†</span></p> <p>In Amy&#8217;s
   finished basement, we listened to records and played with her motherôs
   vast supply of cast-off makeup. It wasnôt long before we began to talk
   about what was really on our minds, which was our new teacher, Robert
   Rusch.</p> <p>Weôd seen last yearôs seventh graders as Rusch made them
   over in his likeness. They became increasingly rowdy and opinionated,
   and said things like údig it,ù úI call bullshit,ù and úright onù in casual
   conversation. úOutrageous,ù was the highest form of praise. Rusch made up
   nicknames for many of the girls (úBananasù and úSassafrasù were two of
   them), and mocked members of both sexes for their innocence and
   credulity. (úAwww, mommy and daddy never told you that politicians are
   all liars? Poor baby!ù) Some of his girl disciples started wearing
   cowboy boots and hanging around him, half-perched on his lap, or with
   their thumbs in his belt loops. When they let him drape his arm over
   their shoulders, his fingers were only millimeters away from their
   newly formed breasts. In the basement, Amy and I made a pact to resist
   the Ruschian influence. We would not turn into his minions, would not
   hang out at his house after school, and would certainly not let him
   touch us. It was disgusting.</p> <p>Given this pact, the notebook
   assignment was problematic. Not only was I supposed to write down my
   thoughts daily, but to do so knowing that he was going to read whatever
   I wrote. My first month or so of entries were so well-defended they
   might as well have been in code: úWatched Anne Boleyn with Dad and KDC.ù
   úIn my next life I will be an elephant.ù úWent crazy at E.J. Korvetteôs.ù
   When my notebook came back from its first review, Rusch had made
   annotations along the lines of úVery interesting. Zzzzzz.ù And in the
   margins next to úI got mad at Josh in yard,ù he wrote, úRight on, Rachel!ù
   This made me feel invaded and antagonized, which no doubt was the
   point.</p> <p>In mid-October, after we had finished reading úLady Sings
   the Blues,ù Rusch brought in some of his Billie Holiday tapes. One was a
   very early recording, girlish and melodic. The second was made near the
   end of Holidayôs life: her voice ravaged, her musical style almost
   experimental. All I could hear was pain. After listening, we had a
   timed writing exercise (you had to keep writing for a whole minute or
   two, or five, or whatever it was). In class I often wrote úI hate Ruschù
   over and over, but this time I wrote about how much Iôd hated the music.
   Rusch was obviously a huge Holiday fan. I knew it would rile him that
   anyone could hate her. Even better, my commentary would show him that
   he had failed to reach me as a teacher!</p> <p>Of course, what I didnôt
   consider was that Rusch liked nothing better than a good argument. He
   copied my rant on mimeo and distributed it in class the next day. I had
   compared Holiday&#8217;s voice to úthe scream of a plantation slave.ù My
   African American classmates called me racist and ignorant. Rusch just
   grinned.</p> <p>In November, Amy got her first menstrual period.
   Scientifically speaking, I felt that I understood this circumstance
   pretty well: Iôd read every word I could find on the subject¶ my motherôs
   old biology textbook, Spock&#8217;s <i>Baby and Child Care</i> and, of
   course, Iôd read the assertion of<span class="Apple-converted-space">†
   </span>Harriet-the-Spyôs friend Janie that úit feels like rocksù in the
   second Harriet book, <i>The Long Secret</i>. I had not actually
   discussed the matter with any adult, least of all my mother.<span
   class="Apple-converted-space">†</span></p> <p>ú&#8230;And he knows,ù said
   Amy, on the phone.</p> <p>úYou told him?ù</p> <p>úNo, I was sitting in the
   lunchroom, and he sat down next to me and said, &#8216;You donôt have to
   wear those pants, it doesnôt show.&#8217;ù That day, she had worn pink
   corduroy pants to school. Rusch also told her he had noticed that her
   breasts were bigger, and said that he had been keeping an eye on
   themîthat he had looked down her shirt.</p> <p>úGross!ù I said.</p> <p>úI
   know,ù said Amy. úBut isnôt that wild?ù</p> <p>Our next book was <i>Soul on
   Ice</i>, Eldridge Cleaverôs prison essays. As I remember it, Cleaver had
   been convicted for raping a white woman. In Ruschôs class we debated
   whether or not he was truly a rapist. After all, society had so
   demonized the idea of black men with white women that his crime could
   also be viewed as an act of revolutionary transgression. Hence, Cleaver
   was a political prisoner. We actually believed this. And that wasnôt
   even the part I remember being disturbed about. What most bothered me
   was the inevitable conclusion from this chain of reasoning that those
   of us whose skin was white were, by genetic heritage, enemies of Black
   Power and would be treated as such úcome the revolution.ù It enraged me
   that, after three years at this ridiculous school that didn&#8217;t
   even have lockers, let alone cheerleaders or dances, I was going to die
   when the Panthers mounted their armed offensive, which seemed
   imminent.</p> <p>One morning, Rusch called on me to read aloud from the
   <em>New York Times</em>îa report on the wedding of one of President
   Nixonôs daughters to a young man named Cox. The article described the
   bridesmaidsô dresses and the food. As I stood, reading, I wondered: Why
   me? Has he divined my secret obsession with clothes (at the time, I
   dressed exclusively in BVD T-shirts and Levis)? Is he mocking my (also
   hidden) WASP background? I didnôt even notice when the words,
   úLemon-blown Coxù came out of my mouth. He had to ask me to read the
   sentence again. There had been a misprint, and the bridegroomôs surname
   had been substituted for some word like úcreamù or úmeringueù in a
   description of the dessert that had been served. On the front page of
   the newspaper of record! Rusch howled at the error. The class caught on
   and followed. No doubt I did, too.</p> <p>That spring we began a new
   unit, Photography, taught by Rusch. There was a small darkroom in the
   attic of the Clinton Hill mansion that housed our school. For the first
   few classes, we all crammed in while Rusch showed us the procedures for
   loading and developing film. Then we were sent out to document our
   lives. I took a lot of pictures of fire hydrants and subway cars.</p>
   <p>When it came time to try printing my selects, Rusch came up to the
   darkroom with me. There was every good reason for him to stand behind
   me and use both his hands to direct mine as I fiddled with the enlarger
   in the red safety light. And when he made me flinch with a quick tickle
   or prod, I was ashamed of my fear. So I pretended to be cool while
   wondering if the feeling that I was experiencing meant I actually
   wanted him to touch me. Was leaning into me officially útouchingù? What
   about massaging my belly? I told him to stop. úWhy, doesnôt it feel good?ù
   I was left to ponder my answer as my first print went in and out of the
   fixer and up on the clothesline to dry.</p> <p>My dad had a darkroom in
   our apartment, and when he had lived with us heôd spent a lot of time in
   there working on images of my mother, my brother, and me. I associated
   the smell of fixer with his undershirts. There was a strong connection
   in my mind between my handsome, silent, missing father and that tiny
   room where his private language was spoken. Now it seemed the darkroom
   was also the domain of my problematic teacher. No clothes were removed
   or bodily fluids expelled. Rusch didnôt force himself on me; at least he
   did not use his size or weight. He just went on tickling and teasing
   and touching and making utterly inappropriate observations for the rest
   of the day. I transferred into Typing, the other úelective.ù</p> <p>That
   summer, Amy joined Rusch, his wife and three kids, and four other girls
   and two boys from our class on Ruschôs annual cross-country van trip.
   They drove to Alaska and slept in tents. She had already had sex with
   Rusch one May afternoon after modeling for nude photographs at his
   house. She told me about it while soaking in her motherôs bathtub. I was
   sitting at eye level with a shelf stocked with remedies I had never
   seen before: Pretty Feet, Jolen, Sal Volatile. I can remember these
   details but not the content of Amyôs story or the sound of her voice. I
   preferred not to hear.</p> <p>I learned a lot in Ruschôs classroom: I
   learned that úrhetoricù meant úbullshit;ù that the New York Rangers were a
   hockey team (and not mounted police, as I had supposed); that the man
   on the Zig Zag rolling papers was not Che Guevara; and that Woody
   Guthrieôs song úPastures of Plentyù was ironic (which makes you wonder
   about úThis Land is Your Land,&#8221; doesnôt it?). I learned who I was,
   and who I was not: I cared far more for safety than for adventure or
   romance. I was a collaboratorînot a revolutionary. Well, okay. I was
   fourteen years old. I knew a lot for fourteen.</p> <p><em>***</em></p>

   400;">That was seven years ago. Since then, Iôve given a lot of thought
   to the stories he told me about his life, and as Fatherôs Day
   approaches, I ponder his need to choose me, a little kid at the time,
   to unload on.</span></p> <p>1. He was born in 1923 in the kitchen of
   his apartment on Garden Street, not far from the Bronx Zoo. His parents
   were born in Russia, came over in steerage, and spoke little
   English.</p> <p>2. His father, Louis, was a mink-cutter in Manhattanôs
   fur district and learned English by reading the <em>New York Times</em>
   and <em>Wall Street Journal</em> every day. His mother, Rae, was
   renowned for her chicken soup and pastry baking. She had a heart
   condition.</p> <p>3. He was by far the youngest of three children, a
   family úsurprise,ù and he ran rampant in the streets.</p> <p>4. When his
   sneakers wore out, he stuffed the soles with cardboard.</p> <p>5. His
   friends would fling clods of dried horse excrement from the street into
   the open door of the Chinese laundry, make obscene gestures, and run
   away.</p> <p>6. He played a mean first base, being a tall lefty.</p>
   <p>7. When the war started and his friends got drafted, he didnôt want
   to get left behind, so he went to his local board and asked if they
   could move him up on the list. They promptly obliged and he was soon
   sent to Camp Van Dorn, Mississippi for basic, where the southern boys
   would rub his forehead, in search of Jew horns. The town sheriff wore
   twin, pearl-handled 45s.</p> <p>8. úWe lived in tarpaper shacks; it was
   the asshole of the world,ù he told the five-year old me.</p> <p>9. He
   got clobbered by an MP&#8217;s baton in a roadhouse brawl started when
   he played úJumpinô at the Jubileeù by Louis Jordan and His Tympany Five on
   the jukebox. He saw a lynched black man hanging from a tree. He said
   there was a race riot on his base that was put down when the still
   segregated Army sent in half-track military vehicles to quell the
   violence. In later years, he denied that this event really
   happened.</p> <p>10. His unit went to England, then France, Belgium and
   Germany. His job was to fix small arms, everything under .50
   caliber.</p> <p>11. One time, he flushed out a group of Nazis from a
   henhouse in rural France. He said his hands were shaking as he pointed
   his carbine at the Germans.</p> <p>12. During the winter of 1944-45,
   his unit was pinned down in the Ardennes. They got bombed and strafed
   every night. This was the Battle of the Bulge. He got frostbite and
   nearly had to have his right big toe amputated. Trees exploded from the
   cold. When the sap froze and expanded, it sounded like gunshots. He
   wrote a postcard to his parents back in the Bronx: úIt is hell hell hell
   every night,ù he said. He had just turned 19.</p> <p>13. In Germany, he
   saw a Russian soldier interrogate a prisoner. In an apparent attempt to
   expedite the flow of information, the Russian pulled out his sidearm
   and shot the Nazi in the face so that his jaw unhinged and flopped
   below his neck. úThose Russians were tough,ù he told me one time, when I
   was home from school with the mumps.</p> <p>14. After the German
   surrender, he was shipped home. While on leave, he went to Coney Island
   with his buddy Nicky and they met a couple of girls on the boardwalk.
   One of the girls would become my mother.</p> <p>15. He was sent to
   Texas to be retrained for the Pacific. Then Truman dropped the big one.
   He was discharged.</p> <p>16. He came back to the Bronx and picked up
   where he left off with the girl who would become my mother.</p> <p>17.
   He never spoke much about the war. Not when I was a kid, not ever. When
   some of his contemporaries would start talking about the rations, or
   basic training, or what they saw or did, he would leave the room. úEmpty
   barrels make the most noise,ù he would tell me.</p> <p>18. He went to
   night school on the G.I. Bill, studied accounting, and worked his way
   up the ladder at a big finance company. He hated accounting, he hated
   his job, and he hated his boss. When I was a kid, he reiterated this to
   me every single day.</p> <p>19. In the morning, before work, he went to
   the liquor cabinet and slugged from a bottle of Scotch before heading
   to the 4 train and off to work.</p> <p>20. He showed me how to strip
   and clean the guns he úliberatedù from the war. He had a German luger, a
   .25 automatic, and a Walther .22 single-shot sport rifle with a
   checkered stock. He told me to never point a gun, even a toy, at
   anyone, and said that if someone in his unit even accidently pointed a
   gun at one of them, they would beat the hell out of that guy.</p>
   <p>21. Every night, when he came home from work, he smelled like
   cigarettes, newsprint, and Scotch. He would go wash up for dinner then
   sit down and say, úAhhh, this is the best part of the day.ù I thought
   that all men should smell like cigarettes, newsprint, and Scotch.</p>
   <p>22. He sat wordlessly for the rest of the night.</p> <p>23. He would
   be asleep in his chair, in front of the Stromberg-Carlson tube tv, by
   nine oôclock.</p> <p>24. He suffered from cruel migraines and<span
   class="Apple-converted-space">† </span>popped APC tablets like Skittles,
   until they wore a hole in his stomach and he got an ulcer. He also had
   a slipped disc and suffered disabling, chronic back pain that seemed to
   always flare up on family vacations.</p> <p>25. He would jump at loud
   noises and chase me and my sister if we accidentally dropped something.
   úGod damn it; no sudden outbursts,ù he would scream, with a fist-bang on
   the wall, or table, or whatever was handy, for emphasis. We never got
   punched, but he backhanded us if he could catch us before we dove under
   the bed for cover.</p> <p>26. He would never play in the snow with us
   kids, and never wanted to ice skate or try skiing. úWhy would I want to
   be out in the cold,ù heôd say.</p> <p>27. He screamed at my mother and my
   mother screamed at him, all the time. úYou never talk,ù my mother would
   scream. úWhy canôt we ever talk?ù</p> <p>28. Once, at a big upstate
   softball game between two rival bungalow colonies, my migraine-ridden,
   bad-back father crushed a windmill pitch and slugged a mammoth grand
   slam. It towered over the outfield and finally landed on the roof of a
   far-away cabin with a thunderous úthunk.ù We little kids danced with
   sweaty glee and I screamed, úMy daddy won the game.ù</p> <p>29. After
   years of complaining about work, he somehow got offered a lot more
   money for a job at a rival company. Our family was ecstatic; the dour,
   dangerous man of the house might actually become happy! He went back
   and forth on it for a week, but finally declined the offer. At home,
   all the air went out of the balloon.</p> <p>30. He kept eating and
   drinking and smoking. One Thanksgiving, he had a heart attack.
   Twenty-two years later, he had another and underwent a quintuple
   bypass.</p> <p>31. His company moved to New Jersey and he moved there
   as well. My parents had been in the same rent-controlled apartment for
   twenty-four years, well after arson had swept that careworn quadrant of
   the Bronx.</p> <p>32. They took the furniture they had owned since they
   were newlyweds to their new home in the suburbs.</p> <p>33. When I got
   married, at 24, he offered to do our tax returns. After the second year
   of this, he said, apropos of nothing, úMy goal is to continue to make
   more than the two of you put together.ù My wife and I found our own
   accountant.</p> <p>34. He retired at 65 and opted for his lump-sum
   payout. The company gave him a gold watch. He thought he was rich. He
   took my mother on a trip to Aruba once.</p> <p>35. My mother still
   complained that he would never talk.</p> <p>36. He would start drinking
   in late morning and keep going until he fell asleep at eight. When Iôd
   call to check on him, heôd quickly say, úHold on. Let me get your
   mother.ù</p> <p>37. Once he flushed Nazis out of a henhouse with a
   carbine. Once he clobbered a towering grand slam that won the game.</p>
   <p>38. úI donôt know what to say.ù</p> <p>39. úYou should see him.ù</p>

   Neighborhood: Lower East Side

   Untitled by Harold Shapinsky
     __________________________________________________________________

   Twenty New York blocks gets you a mile. Back in ‚Äúour time,‚Äù a motley
   crew of urban youth crossed the Manhattan landscape with that formula
   in our heads. We understood distance. We got time. We lived the
   algebraic formula of Time x Speed = Distance. If we started peddling
   our bikes at the top of the hill on Lexington just above 34th, we would
   coast all the way to 23rd street, shaving minutes, reserving energy,
   and feeling wind on our faces all the way to Gramercy Park. In the New
   York summer that was special, like soft ice cream, a public swimming
   pool, and playing in an open fire hydrant.

   Some days we ran through the subway. But riding a bike kept dollars in
   your pocket, something that mattered to me. With two impoverished
   artists as my parents, I never wanted money for money‚Äôs sake; but
   freedom, yeah. I started searching for that feeling of freedom on bike
   rides more than thirty years ago and I am still searching now. Longing
   for the same rush, the peace, and the joy.

   We flew from the Lower East Side to the Cloisters. We glided down to
   Chinatown and back through Little Italy. On a Saturday or Sunday, we
   might ride from Washington Square to Central Park and back down to Wall
   Street. And wherever we went, we counted up miles at the end and
   marveled at our odometer. 100 blocks? By our soft math: Five miles. Up
   and back? Ten miles. We boogied. We inflated. We rose and fell through
   side streets and avenues, scraping up against cabs, barely avoiding
   pedestrians, and chasing all that we did not have.

   Like children everywhere, we weren‚Äôt and yet we were special. Kids in
   pursuit of adventure. Looking for fun. Building our own realities.

   Beneath it all, however, something bled us. We tried to avoid the fires
   around us by moving rapidly through the alleys and parks and streets.
   When blind turns came, we kept moving. Was it enough? Not even close,
   but we were the lucky ones.

   Cut a corner in Little Italy, riding up from South Street on a Saturday
   or Sunday; suddenly, there were white ‚ÄúItalian‚Äù boys on our tails
   chasing us and throwing bottles from their bikes. We had crossed a
   line. Wrong place? Wrong Time? Was it the way we looked or talked or
   dressed? Because we were a polyglot group, a stew of race, religion,
   and class? Were we feared and hated for what we were or appeared to be?

   During those years, there was freedom, but there was also fear. That
   feeling‚Äîthe cold sweating terror that eats away at you day after day
   after day and turns you inside out. Powerlessness creates an inner
   rage. Some of my friends fell prey to that rage, becoming enamored of
   guns. That was one way to live and die.

   Most of us simply learned that a random moment could change your life
   or someone else‚Äôs life, snuff it out, or put your body and soul in a
   blender.

   Certain days are embedded in my memory. I see my best friend, a tall
   and powerful African American teen who looked like a man years older,
   struggling on the ropes, unable to avoid a round of ‚Äúwho you looking
   at‚Äù with a crew of older boys.  A muscled teen banged my friend with
   his fists over and over, continuing the cycle of violence as I and
   other friends watched, helpless and ashamed, stuck behind a wall of
   boys. We felt weak. In our minds, we were weak. Sometimes we even
   thought we deserved to be called ‚Äúfaggots‚Äù by our tormenters. At a time
   when homophobia was celebrated, gay and straight could sometimes be
   victims together because of the blind hatred surrounding all of us. But
   perpetrators and victims also shared something: self-loathing.

   By the standards of our East Village neighborhood, my crew of friends
   lived well but not easily. We were the children of intellectuals and
   artists, people who settled their families in or near Alphabet City, a
   neighborhood of new and old immigrants and working poor. Looking back,
   our parents might today be called urban pioneers. But back then, other
   people just thought them crazy. What parent would subject their
   children to poor public schools and crime? Prostitutes walked just a
   couple of blocks away. Homeless men often lay on the sidewalk; I
   stepped around them on the way to school.

   My elementary school, P.S. 63, was mostly Puerto Rican, which opened my
   eyes to many things. I still feel a connection to that Caribbean island
   and its flag, having colored it so many times at school. But I wasn‚Äôt
   Puerto Rican. Nor was I Black or Chinese. I was skinny a kid with blond
   hair. Sometimes I stuck out. Other times I crossed over.  Luckily, one
   summer I played baseball with an entirely Puerto Rican team except for
   myself. I was embraced.

   It was all Russian Roulette. One day could change it all. How was I to
   know what a zip gun looked like when I was surrounded at my elementary
   school one winter morning by some boys. They pressed it to my gut. I
   stayed calm. I simply did not know the danger. And that probably saved
   me from a hospital. In that same school yard, sitting on a bench
   waiting to get into a basketball game, an older boy, maybe 15, showed
   me two large knives. All he said to me was: ‚ÄúI wonder what it would be
   like to stick these in someone‚Äôs neck.‚Äù In that moment, he held power
   over me but I just said ‚Äúyeah.‚Äù Because I had already learned to
   pretend that I didn‚Äôt feel anything.

   One of the worst days came when my best friend, the same one who had
   endured a terrible beating for nothing, spent a good chunk of his 5th
   grade recess being chased through the schoolyard by about a dozen older
   boys. None of the teachers moved. Maybe they didn‚Äôt understand the
   danger? I asked these adults to help my friend. They did nothing. And
   that was a powerful lesson. The only thing that saved my friend was an
   African-American stranger, a man we didn‚Äôt know stepping out of nowhere
   and with one punch, sending the horde fleeing. It seemed impossible.
   Like God had reached down and answered our prayers.

   That was life for our little gang, the children of bohemians, whose
   parents had embraced a neighborhood they could afford. We were forever
   changed by living on a tightrope of wonder and fear. Our parents taught
   us ideals and talked about ideas. They were painters, writers, dancers,
   actors, musicians, and teachers. They believed in their art and had
   artistic egos.

   They could see suffering around them. The Vietnam War raged. Our
   parents marched. Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were
   assassinated in the same year. But did our parents know that as
   eight-year olds, we played ‚ÄúChicago Riots‚Äù on the playground. Did they
   know how close the chaos and violence were to them through us?

   We never told them. But looking back on those years after I had my own
   children, I made one simple promise to myself and my sons. It was that
   they should never know such things‚Äîthe hatred, the raw violence, and
   the early loss of innocence too.

   Still, all my friends paid a price. Most of us survived. Some danced at
   the edges of a violent world. Others fell to drugs and saw their lives
   spinning out of control. Some died. I escaped by moving thousands of
   miles away to California. We all took refuge; but inside, it has taken
   decades for me to find peace.

   Before finding any kind of peace, I learned that my many childhood
   nightmares about people breaking in to my family‚Äôs apartment were a
   metaphor for how vulnerable I felt and how fragile my life really
   was. On one level, as I got older, things were going great. When I was
   twenty years old, I fell in love with a beautiful and brilliant
   woman. On a summer night on a dark stoop in the East Village we kissed.
   I left her in the early morning to go to Europe for a college semester
   abroad, in Rome, one of the most romantic cities in the world.

   Then, months later, when the romantic semester was over, I learned my
   parents had given up their rent-control apartment and decided to flee
   New York with no money and hardly a plan. They had sold all their
   furniture or put it in storage. My childhood belongings might have
   existed somewhere, but they were essentially torched. I never found
   them again. The chaos that had always been lurking under my life had
   bubbled up. Friends taught me the value of love and friendship, keeping
   me above water. I stayed in college even as I had to figure out how to
   get myself through it all financially and emotionally.

   The following summer, my parents had found a small sublet. My father
   had lost 60 pounds. He looked frail and barely went outside. My parents
   thought he was sick, suffering from MS or perhaps some other disease. I
   found a job and slept in a tiny dining room next to the bathroom. My
   optimism held, but I could feel it slipping.

   And then one night that summer a sound woke me up. I stood. The
   bathroom door was open. My father lay in the tub. His wrists slit. I
   woke my mother and called the police and ambulance. We took him to the
   hospital. His own sticky reality had brought him to this place.
   Feelings of failure. Being told by his mother that she tried to abort
   him. Having to drop out of school to support his family. Knowing that
   he was a failure in his family‚Äôs eyes for being a painter rather than
   something useful. He heard voices and saw people who weren‚Äôt there. His
   fears became his entire life. Now I knew the fear came from inside my
   home as much as outside it.

   Whatever innocence I still had was gone. My father survived, but it
   would take another ten years for me to get back the hope and feelings
   of adventure that went with those early bike rides through the canyons
   of the City. It would take me even longer to discover my own path. But
   the lesson I took from it all is not that any of us are victims or
   failures: We all struggle to become more than we are while breaking
   free of legacies of our past. There is nothing more heroic than that‚Äîor
   harder to achieve.

   May we all succeed and help others along the way.

       I am reminded of playing ‚ÄúChicago cops‚Äù with my older brother. He
       would be the cop, while I would be the ‚Äúhippie‚Äù. Violent games were
       the norm, but with a moral overtone. We would gleefully pretend to
       be killing German soldiers in fantasy World War II battles.

       Growing up feels like struggling to become stronger, bouncing back
       on 52 psi, learning to coast in a world that is cracking in at all
       sides. What is the effect of a 40 year siege on a 6 mile strip of
       humanity? I‚Äôll stop here because that‚Äôs unthinkable.

   I was eleven when I got my first paper route. You had to be thirteen.

   ‚ÄúIf the route manager approves it, I‚Äôll give it to you,‚Äù Freddy
   Bullwinkle said. Kids called him Bullwinkle because he had big ears. A
   few days later it was mine. The Long Island Star Journal.

   ‚ÄúRemember, John, the most important part of the job is collecting.‚Äù He
   winked.  ‚ÄúIf you get any new customers, you get cash or prizes.‚Äù

   I did great. I liked people and people liked me, and most important it
   got me out of the house.

   A couple of months later, I picked up the papers at the delivery spot
   at the 32nd Avenue underpass to the BQE. As I cut the twine away, I
   noticed the headline. Martin Luther King Jr. Killed.

   They shot him. I sat on the paper stack and tried to read what
   happened. I sucked at reading. It said he was dead. I shuffled the
   papers into my cart and thought, who‚Äôs going to be their leader now? My
   Aunt Loretta who lived in a black section of the Bronx had said he was
   going to be killed next. She was right. They killed Malcolm X, and now
   him.

   After I finished delivering I went home. I was working on a bowl of
   cereal at the kitchen table and looking through my route book. It was
   Friday. I needed to do some collecting. My mutt Charcoal barked wildly,
   and next thing I knew Dad was in the kitchen doorway.

   ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your mother?‚Äù He had the look and sound of booze in his eyes
   and voice.

   ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I just got in.‚Äù I wanted to say, what do I look like, a
   freaking crystal ball? But I didn‚Äôt. I wasn‚Äôt that stupid. Even if I
   did have an escape route behind me. I could jump out of any window of
   this second-floor house and get away from this crazy father of mine
   before he got one step closer.

   ‚ÄúWhere ya been?‚Äù he growled.

   ‚ÄúDelivered the papers.‚Äù I held one out to him. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs an extra.‚Äù

   He looked at the headline. ‚ÄúFuckin CIA did it again! First Kennedy, now
   this poor prick. There‚Äôs going to be plenty of riots.‚Äù He threw the
   paper back at me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too young to be delivering that shit.‚Äù

   ‚ÄúI just turned 12 two days ago. You weren‚Äôt even home.‚Äù

   ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bullshit me. I watched you delivering for months now.‚Äù He glared
   at me. The window again became an option. ‚ÄúWhat does everyone say about
   that mop of hair on your head, Reidy?‚Äù

   ‚ÄúNo one says nothing.‚Äù

   He lit a cigarette from the gas jet on the stove. I thought he would
   burn his eyebrows, he was that close.  I settled back into the bowl of
   Rice Krispies and heard the crunching of the cereal in my ears.

   That‚Äôs when I first noticed a few cockroaches in the bowl. Legs up. My
   God, I thought, pregnant ones. The eggs on their bodies looked like the
   Rice Krispies. I had definitely eaten a few. I pushed the bowl away.

   ‚ÄúI think I just ate roach eggs.‚Äù

   Dad made a ‚Äúwho cares‚Äù face.  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs protein. It won‚Äôt kill
   you.‚Äù He had all the answers. And that made it easy.

   I thought about it, pulled the bowl back and finished it off. I put it
   in the sink.

   ‚ÄúWash that bowl and bring it over here,‚Äù he said. Dad pulled a quart of
   Rheingold beer out of a brown paper bag and guzzled some. ‚ÄúCome on,
   Reidy, clean that bowl off nice. I‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù He left the
   kitchen.

   I rinsed the bowl with water, then shook it off and dried it with my
   undershirt.

   He came strolling back in with a smile. ‚ÄúGimme that bowl and sit on the
   table.‚Äù

   I did what he told me.

   ‚ÄúIf your Mom‚Äôs too busy to get you a haircut, I guess I‚Äôll have to do
   it myself.‚Äù He placed the bowl on my head. It felt kind of like an army
   helmet, and that‚Äôs all Dad talked about anyway. I didn‚Äôt mind. It took
   me away from the thought of a million baby cockroaches hatching in my
   stomach. He pulled a large pair of scissors from his back pocket and
   started to cut my hair.

   He cut and snipped while I searched my route book for customers who
   owed more than one week. I paid him no mind. He took another swig of
   beer, then pulled the bowl off.

   He did a few quick snips on the top of my head then said, ‚ÄúOkay, you‚Äôre
   done.‚Äù

   ‚ÄúThanks, Dad.‚Äù I jumped off the table. He was happy and so was I.

   I ran out the door to Mrs. Kahn‚Äôs house. It was right down the
   block. Timmy, her son, was in my older sister Carol‚Äôs class. Tim‚Äôs dad
   was a cop. He‚Äôd been shot in the belly by a bad guy and still had the
   bullet in him. He was back at work. I figured, you get shot you can
   retire. Not him.

   Dad said, ‚ÄúThe reason he‚Äôs working is the risk of being shot again is
   better than being home all day with his ball-bustin‚Äô wife.‚Äù

   Timmy was a big comic collector. His house was filled with them. Every
   Batman, Superman, Daredevil, he had them all. He never played outside
   ever. When Mrs. Kahn opened the door, I could see piles of them.

   ‚ÄúWow! Tim‚Äôs got a big collection.‚Äù

   ‚ÄúYes, John. His dad brings them home every night.‚Äù

   ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs neat,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI wish my dad did that.‚Äù

   ‚ÄúOh God, John! What happened to your hair? Who cut it?‚Äù

   ‚ÄúMy Dad did.‚Äù I must have looked puzzled.  I felt self-conscious. How
   come she‚Äôs making a big deal about this? I just saved seventy-five
   cents.

   ‚ÄúCome in, I want you to see it. Did you see it?‚Äù

   I didn‚Äôt need to. My Dad did it. I was right there. This lady is nuts,
   I thought. No wonder her husband went back to work.

   She stood me in front of the mirror, holding my shoulders as if I was
   going to faint or something. I noticed a clip of hair on my lip. I
   tongued it into my mouth. It tasted like roach spray.

   ‚ÄúLook at yourself.‚Äù

   I didn‚Äôt look that bad. Sure, it was a little crooked, but when I
   tilted my head, which I did, it looked fine. Yes, there were a few
   unusual deep cuts out of the top, not too bad.

   She handed me a cap and said, ‚ÄúPut this on, no one will notice. It‚Äôs a
   shame he did that to you. Was he drunk?‚Äù

   I shook my head. ‚ÄúMy Dad don‚Äôt drink,‚Äù I lied. But the truth was, he
   was what my friends called ‚Äúshitfaced.‚Äù

   She gave me a double tip. I guess she felt sorry for me. As I ran down
   the block I thought I should have looked at my own mirror in my house,
   but most of them were broken.

   It took an hour to get the five blocks done. I got home and ran in. Off
   came the hat.

   Mom saw me. ‚ÄúJesus Christ, what the hell happened to you?‚Äù

   ‚ÄúNothing, I just went collecting.‚Äù

   ‚ÄúWho did that to you?‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt believe she had to ask me, with all
   my hair under her shoes and on the table and chair behind her.

   Mom got up and walked into Dad‚Äôs room. There was a lot of screaming and
   yelling. Then she came into the kitchen. She handed me a dollar. ‚ÄúGo
   get it fixed.‚Äù

   ‚ÄúWhere do I go?‚Äù

   ‚ÄúGo to the Mirrors.‚Äù

   The Mirrors was the neighborhood barber shop. It was near the projects
   where the blacks lived.

   As I walked out, I thought about how if I ran into any black guys down
   there I should apologize to them about how their leader got killed. I
   figured they would be sad like we were when Kennedy got killed by the
   government.

   I was in front of the candy store. There were no blacks. I was around
   the block from the barbershop when an older kid I knew stopped me. His
   name was Tommy Thomas. He had been caught for purse snatching. It was
   written up in the papers I delivered. He was tall with greasy stringy
   blond hair. Tommy wore a tee shirt and had needle marks on his arms
   with ripped jeans and sneakers. He had those sky blue junkie eyes that
   were always half closed.

   He saw me and called me over. ‚ÄúI need a favor. You gotta go in the
   candy store and get me a model airplane. Pick any one you want. Keep
   the plane, but you gotta give me the glue.‚Äù

   ‚ÄúSure, no problem.‚Äù He wanted to sniff it. I had sniffed glue before,
   but never bought it.

   He gave me two bucks. ‚ÄúThe fifty cent change is for you. Don‚Äôt forget
   the glue, he won‚Äôt sell it to me.‚Äù

   I walked in and looked up on the counter. The store smelled like a
   candy factory, sweet. It ate me up. I stared into the bright ceiling
   light. It was like a movie set.

   The guy behind the cash register stared. ‚ÄúCan I help you?‚Äù

   ‚ÄúSure, I‚Äôd like a model airplane.‚Äù

   He studied me like a cop. ‚ÄúOh yeah? How long you been building them?‚Äù

   I didn‚Äôt know what to say, so I pulled off my hat. He saw my head and
   was distracted. He shook his head at me, looking sorry.

   ‚ÄúGive me that one,‚Äù I pointed. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt forget the glue.‚Äù

   His head whipped back at me like it was spring loaded. He looked around
   the store and barked, ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs this for?‚Äù

   I smiled. ‚ÄúMe. My Dad got drunk and messed my hair up. He wants to make
   up for it. Okay? Or do you want him to come in here and give you a
   haircut? He‚Äôs in the bar on the corner. Want me to get him?‚Äù

   I walked out of the store and followed Tommy to the back alley across
   from the barbershop. I gave him the glue and held the plane. He
   squirted it into a small bag, brought it to his mouth and nose and
   started sniffing. After a minute, he held the bag out to me. I smelled
   it and pushed it back. I pulled off my hat.

   ‚ÄúI got enough problems,‚Äù I said.

   ‚ÄúHoly shit,‚Äù he laughed, ‚ÄúA fuckin‚Äô butcher job you got.‚Äù

   I wanted to take a sniff to feel better, but didn‚Äôt want to turn out
   like him. I put my hat back on as he melted down the wall, his back
   against it. He started to take a few more huffs.

   ‚ÄúSee ya later,‚Äù I said.

   I walked across the street with my glue-less model air plane under my
   arm. When I opened the door to the barbershop, the bells chimed. The
   smell of hair tonic was in the air. There were a few people ahead of
   me. I picked up a Sports Illustrated and next to it I noticed a Playboy
   Magazine. I quickly grabbed it and laid it inside and opened it. It
   said ‚ÄúHoliday Issue.‚Äù There were plenty of naked women inside.

   The barber yanked it out of my hand. In a thick Italian accent he said,
   ‚ÄúYou no eighteen.‚Äù

   ‚ÄúSo?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhy do you have them here if I can‚Äôt look?‚Äù

   He shoved the sports magazine back at me.   He went back to the kid
   whose hair he was cutting. Every time I looked over, he was giving me
   the evil eye.  I was getting nervous. Even when I looked up above me, I
   could see him staring. The place was covered in mirrors. Finally it was
   my turn.

   ‚ÄúOkay kid, you‚Äôra next.‚Äù

   I put the model airplane down and sat in the barber seat. I pulled off
   my cap and he stepped back.

   ‚ÄúYou, geta outa my chair,‚Äù he said.

   I got up. I thought there was a fire or something. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù

   ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna geta sued.‚Äù

   ‚ÄúI need a haircut, or my Mom‚Äôs going to be mad. I can‚Äôt go back home
   without it fixed. I‚Äôm going to be in trouble.‚Äù

   He came over to me and pointed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not touching that head with a ten
   foot pole.‚Äù

   I looked at him, knowing that if I went home now my Dad would be pissed
   cause my mother would be bitching at him.

   ‚ÄúYou bringa back your momma or papa,‚Äù he said.

   So I left. When I got back to the house, Mom looked at me. ‚ÄúWhat
   happened to your haircut?‚Äù

   ‚ÄúHe wouldn‚Äôt do it, he said he was going to get sued or something.‚Äù

   Mom looked at my older sister Mary. ‚ÄúYou take him back and get him his
   haircut now.‚Äù

   I walked back into the barbershop with Mary. She acted like my mom.  He
   stopped us at the door.

   ‚ÄúI‚Äôma not a cutting his hair, he‚Äôs going getta me in a trouble.‚Äù

   ‚ÄúWell, if you don‚Äôt cut my hair, my Dad is going to come in here and
   beat you up. He‚Äôs in the corner bar.‚Äù I said.

   Mary said, ‚ÄúPlease cut his hair.‚Äù

   Finally the other barber pulled me into his chair.  I sat down.

   ‚ÄúThere is only one way to fix this,‚Äù he said.

   I watched as he grabbed a big electric razor and started to buzz me. A
   shiver went up my spine from the vibration of the razor on my neck. I
   was getting a crew cut without my permission.

   I pulled away. ‚ÄúHey, what the hell!‚Äù

   ‚ÄúIt will grow back, kid.‚Äù

   Mary was smiling. I was so pissed. A crew cut. I hated him. I wanted to
   burn the store down. He made me look how I usually felt. Ugly.

   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a dick,‚Äù I said as I walked out.

   When I got home, Dad was standing there. ‚ÄúNow that‚Äôs what I call a GI
   haircut. You finally look human.‚Äù

   My sister Sara started to laugh. Carol grabbed me and rubbed my head
   for good luck. I took the hat Mrs. Kahn gave me and ran down the street
   to put it in her mailbox.

   Later that night I went back to the barbershop with a mason brick in my
   hand. I was scared because I had to walk past the creepy old cemetery.
   I thought ghosts lived there.  I looked around and as I ran by, I fast
   pitched it underhand through the barbershop window.

   The smash was tremendous. Like an explosion. I ran my ass off.

   As I turned the corner, I saw Tommy Thomas leaning against a building
   on the nod.

   I stopped. ‚ÄúHey, Tommy.‚Äù He looked up. ‚ÄúYou better get moving. They‚Äôre
   rioting on the corner. The fuzz are coming.‚Äù

   I kept running. At least I had warned him. When the cops came by they
   wouldn‚Äôt grab him.

   I never went to the Mirrors again. But I kept delivering papers.

A Sports Coat is Worth a Thousand Words

   My dad reached inside the closet for his new jacket, single breasted,
   two button, and straight off the rack. It was pencil gray with flecks
   of black in it and may have had those professorial looking patches on
   the sleeves, but I‚Äôm not sure. He didn‚Äôt care much about clothes and
   the jacket was nothing special. ‚ÄúSee this baby?‚Äù he said, holding it by
   its hanger. ‚ÄúThis is the coat I‚Äôll be buried in.‚Äù He gave it a quick
   once-over before putting it back. ‚ÄúA little tight in the chest though.‚Äù

   I told him not to worry. Once he was in the ground he was bound to drop
   a few pounds. ‚ÄúPretty soon, it‚Äôll be hanging off your shoulders.‚Äù We
   had a good laugh. The man was only two decades older than me. He wasn‚Äôt
   going anywhere. But still, he didn‚Äôt like getting older and was
   referencing his mortality way too often. ‚ÄúYour mom‚Äôs ninety-four,‚Äù I
   assured him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll cruise straight through your eighties.‚Äù He‚Äôd smile
   back and shake his head.

   In my classroom I keep a calendar that my students use to track time,
   field trips, vacations, and birthdays, marking off the days until
   something special arrives. For the past three months I‚Äôve been doing
   it, too, counting up while they counted down, penciling in a number at
   the top of every box. On January 2nd, I‚Äôd rushed from my classroom in
   Jamaica, Queens to Brookdale Hospital. When I returned, the calendar
   and blackboard still read January 2nd, as if my classroom had frozen
   until I returned. As of right now, my father‚Äôs been dead for ninety
   days.

   There‚Äôs no reason to mark time when the final number is forever, but I
   do it anyway, a tiny stab of pain every time the pencil touches paper.
   My dad suffered an unexpected, massive heart attack at work. I‚Äôve heard
   people call this the widow-maker and that‚Äôs exactly what it did.

   My father had looked good at his wake, his casket flanked by flowered
   wreaths. A tight band of matriarchs, aunts, cousins, and godmothers,
   had come forward to make sure that every detail was perfect. He was
   laid out in his new sports jacket, black tie, and the crisp, white
   oxford shirt I‚Äôd purchased at a nearby mall. The beard he‚Äôd worn since
   he left the military was neatly trimmed, a set of rosary beads draped
   across his hands.

   There was one other detail that stood out, something that set off a
   wave of magical thinking that‚Äôs often needed at times like these.
   Somehow the right side of my father‚Äôs sealed lips had been curved into
   a smile, something one might find on a sly, cartoon fox or rascally
   rabbit, a guy who was pleased with things, a man who knew that
   everything would be alright. I watched loved ones approach his casket,
   gesture to his face, and smile back. There was no smile, of course,
   just some happy accident that brought us comfort or perhaps the latest
   fad in mortuary science. Maybe some hotshot embalmer was leaving wry
   grins as a trademark to show off his skills. It made my mother happy,
   though, so we‚Äôll call it a smile.

   We‚Äôd always been affectionate, but had never really touched. Those
   barriers fell away the moment he‚Äôd died. In the hospital I‚Äôd peppered
   his forehead with kisses, wiped some blood from his lips, and cried
   into his already pale face. I continued touching him throughout his
   wake, stroking his beard and rubbing his chest.

   Conversation swirled about the room as I tended to the casket. Oddly
   enough, the surreal, cocktail party atmosphere of a traditional
   Catholic wake can be comforting. The place had a good buzz, family and
   friends catching up, making sure my mother was never alone. Amidst the
   scattered assemblies stood a large, older man with powerful looking
   shoulders and a stoic face I recalled from the eighties. We tend to
   forget how young these athletes are when they retire from their sport.
   This guy could‚Äôve cleared the room with a raised eyebrow. I didn‚Äôt know
   him, but he looked intelligent and kind, placid as he stood just a few
   feet away.

   No one in my immediate family had ever met Marty Lyons, former New York
   Jets great and noted humanitarian. He was a friend of my aunt‚Äôs family
   and was here to pay his respects to them. Lyons was a key member of the
   New York Jets Sack Exchange, along with Abdul Salaam, Mark Gastineau,
   and Joe Klecko, a defensive line so fierce it caused the NFL to start
   counting quarterback sacks as a statistic. As I stole glances his way,
   I realized he was the only member I‚Äôd never met. His presence at the
   wake flooded me again with boyhood memories of sports and my dad.

   An eighties childhood on Long Island was idyllic, although somewhat
   limiting for kids not yet old enough to drive. I‚Äôd often come home from
   team practice just to play more sports until dark. We kept hearing
   about some idiocy called fireball, a demented version of dodgeball
   where every player was already a loser, and was compelled to try it.
   Simply dip some tennis balls in gas, light them on fire, and let the
   fun begin. During the hysteria of swatting and kicking explosives at my
   best pals, a ball stuck to the top of my right sneaker, singeing
   quickly through its mesh and leaving a gaping hole. I got so panicked I
   ended up burying it in the backyard without a second pair. The next day
   at Little League, all eyes were on the kid digging into the mound in a
   pair of brown loafers.

   My father arrived from work to see his son pitching in church shoes.
   When irritated, the Long Island accent would get thicker. ‚ÄúBryan,
   what-da-hell-iz-is? Where‚Äôs da sneakas we jus‚Äô ga-choo..?‚Äù

   My father rooted for me to succeed until the moment his heart stopped
   beating. I am the proverbial fortunate son.

   I eventually went over to Marty Lyons and introduced myself. We shook
   hands and I thanked him for coming. He left having no clue what an
   important family circle he‚Äôd helped me complete. All it took was one
   retired, defensive lineman to kick start a wave of emotions I hadn‚Äôt
   considered in years. I was very pleased that he‚Äôd been here. Later, I
   smoothed the lapels of my father‚Äôs suit and spoke to him for the last
   time. ‚ÄúYou see that? A Jet was here. Ninety-three from the Sack
   Exchange‚Ä¶‚Äù My dad smiled.

   He continued to smile as the lid of his casket was closed and then
   transported to Calverton National Cemetery, where my mother was
   presented with the American flag. Then my father‚Äôs body would be placed
   into the Long Island soil, wearing his new sports jacket forever.
