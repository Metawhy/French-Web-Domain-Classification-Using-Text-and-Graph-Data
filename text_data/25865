Welcome!

   This blog is here for you to find fun learning activities to do with
   your children. We share great ideas we find and love on the Internet,
   as well as ideas we come up with on our own! We also like to share
   resources we find helpful.
   To find ideas for your child, click on the age range blog label or on
   the theme/topic you are looking for (on the left side of the page). In
   each post, we try to list optimal age ranges for the activity, but you
   must judge for yourself if it is appropriate for your child. When you
   try an activity out, please comment and let us (and everyone else) know
   how your child liked it!

We have been quiet...and for good reason!

   Hello! We have been super quiet around here lately. I am sure you have
   noticed. We have good reason. Raegan and I have been writing a book! We
   have been working for years to write a preschool curriculum book. We
   wrote it so it can be used for any ages from a baby on up to a five
   year old. Check out our website for more info: Babes, Tots, and Kids.
   We are running a giveaway today on Chronicles of a Babywise Mom. You
   can go there to learn even more. Here is the giveaway info:

Simple Summer: Mind Blowing Science

   [June+027.jpg]
   My mom got a Mind Blowing Science Kit for my son for Christmas. He has
   enjoyed it over the months and has especially enjoyed it this summer.
   This kit comes with everything you need to do do 11 different
   experiments. The instructions include prompts on making hypothesis as
   well as an explanation as to why things happened the way they did. This
   is a great kit to get for days you need something simple that is
   already prepared for you. It retails on Amazon for 20 and right now is
   on sale for 15.

Simple Summer: Face Painting with Colored Pencils

   [june+025.jpg]
   At a recent birthday party, my girls had their faces painted. But the
   mom at this party did it the genius way--she used colored pencils. Just
   regular old colored pencils. What you do is take your colored pencil
   and dip it in water until it is soft enough to write easily on skin.
   Then you paint away. Not messy! So much so, that I let my girls do it
   to each other at home, which thrills them. Give it a try!

Simple Summer: Simple Preschool Cirriculum

   [images?q=tbn:ANd9GcScDkzLZ9mh13tb98Ipe9Vv7T_cFG7AZlkZh8sVAIN5ELhqy1Vm0
                                     Q]
                                                   source

   While browsing my online library, looking for eBooks, I cam across this
   section that has a lesson plan for you for every month of the year. I
   thought it would make a great resource for simple summer learning! I
   find the biggest time suck for learning activities is the actual
   planning and preparing--not the doing--and in the summer, I really
   don't want to be sitting and planning and preparing. So I thought I
   would pass the link along to you if you are interested--it is linked
   right to June:

Teacher Appreciation Meal

   [May+018.jpg]
   I am fortunate to have a friend who is a master at serving food to
   large groups of people. She always helps me with the meal for Teacher
   Appreciation Week. This year, we did Navajo Tacos. This is a fried
   scone (Utah style...I think often called "elephant ears" in different
   parts) with meat, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream...whatever you
   might put on a taco. We bought all of the ingredients for 130 at Sams.
   [May+013.jpg]
   We had room moms and volunteers bring a dessert. People love bringing
   desserts. Most people can easily throw something together. Teachers
   loved the variety of sweet treats. We also had a variety of drinks.
   [May+017.jpg]
   We finished the meal off with each teacher getting a gift
   card--teachers love gift cards!

Teacher Gift: Pamper Set

   [May+007.jpg]
   We wanted to give the teachers something they could use to just pamper
   themselves.
   We did a lufa, nailpolish, bubble bath, hand lotion, and chap stick. We
   were able to get a lot of the things from AVON for a really reasonable
   price. Here is a link to the gift tag:

School Supply Gift

   [AprilMay+380.jpg]
   To go along with the theme of "You've Colored Our World, Now Let Us
   Brighten Yours," we gave the teachers a school supply kit with the
   colors of the rainbow. We included crayons, glue, pens, pencils, pencil
   top erasers, notebook, tissues, and sanitizing wipes, all in a cute
   bag. We bought most of these supplies last summer during the sales that
   lead up to the school year starting off. The pencil top erasers were
   purchased through Amazon--they have some great deals there. We bought
   them in gross boxes and then divided them up in those little treat
   bags.
   Here is a link to the tag we put on it.

Dinosaur Diorama

   [dino.jpg]
   The diorama! Can you believe I have been a parent for almost nine years
   and have not yet done a diorama? Truth be told, I am not all that
   "into" artistic things, and neither is my first born. My second born,
   now five, however, is a major artist. She loves, loves, loves to do
   art. She found this in a book and immediately wanted to create it. This
   is found in the book Cats Sleep Anywhere published by D.C. Heath and
   Company. (true...strange title for a book with a dinosaur activity in
   it?).
   Supplies:
     * shoe box
     * rocks
     * twigs or small branches
     * bandaid
     * paper
     * scissors
     * pencil
     * crayons
     * tape
     * one straw

   [dino2.jpg]
   Make the Dinosaur:
    1. Fold your paper in half.
    2. Draw a dinosaur on one half of the paper. Make it so the top of the
       head and the back are on the fold of the paper.
    3. Cut out the dinosaur. Do not cut along the fold where the
       dinosaur's back and head are.
    4. Color the dinosaur with the crayons.
    5. Cut the straw into four equal sized pieces.
    6. Tape one straw piece to each leg of the dinosaur on the inside of
       the dinosaur.

   [dino1.jpg]
   Make the Home:
    1. Cut one long side of the shoebox off so it is open at the top.
    2. Color in the sky, grass, mountains, a sun...you could also make
       these out of paper and glue them in place.
    3. Take your two twig pieces and adhere them to a large rock with the
       bandaid.
    4. Put your dino and rocks in the shoebox. Ta-da!

Play Doh Fine Motor Work

   [February_22_2013+(1).jpg]
   Play doh is a great activity for working many learning areas. You have
   sensory, art, creativity, colors, and fine motor work. You can easily
   add in even more.
   When I had only one child who played with toys and made messes, I
   thought play doh was such a huge mess and cinged when that activity
   came to the forefront. Now it is my favorite! The children sit in one
   spot and play for an extended period. Sure, little bits of play doh get
   stuck to the counter and spread on the floor, but the reality is that
   it is so much easier to clean up than toys spread around the toy area.
   Right now, we are loving using toothpicks with our play doh. You
   flatten out the play doh, take your toothpick and practice whatever
   needs to be practiced. You can write letters, write names, do math
   problems, draw shapes, and draw pictures. We love play doh!

Clover Handprints

   [stPatricks.jpg]
   McKenna made this at a friend's house. I love crafts with the child's
   handprint! This is simple, you just have the child dip her hands in
   green paint and then make a clover. You can do three handprints or
   four. Then use a finger to make the stem. You then have a cute craft
   decoration!

Ice Skate Craft

   [iceskates.jpg]
   This activity provides a fun winter decoration while working fine motor
   skills.
   SUPPLIES
     * Yarn or string
     * Popscicle sticks
     * Aluminum foil
     * Construction paper
     * Scissors
     * Glue or tape
     * Paper hole punch

   METHOD
    1. Cut out skate shapes (older preschoolers and older can do this
       step).
    2. Punch holes for the "laces."
    3. Have your child wrap the popscicle sticks with the aluminum foil.
       Tape or glue one to the bottom of each skate.
    4. Have your child string the laces through the holes (tape down the
       string on one side--you can see that done on the skate on the right
       in the picture). Go through both skates with the yarn. Then tape it
       down on the other skate when done lacing.

Pattern Block Piece Picture

   [patternblockpicture.jpg]
   First off, sorry about my very long hiatus! I really needed a break
   from worrying about getting posts up here, so I took it. Sometimes you
   just need to let things go, you know?
   We of course didn't let doing learning activities go, so on with the
   posting!
   This is a great activity to work math skills.
   SUPPLIES:
     * paper
     * glue
     * crayons (optional)
     * scissors
     * pattern blocks or pattern shapes printed off of your computer (you
       can make the shapes in a Word document and print them out)

   ACTIVITY
   Have your child trace the pattern block pieces onto a paper and then
   cut them out. If you don't have pattern block pieces, just create some
   shapes in Word and print them out. If your child isn't able to trace
   and cut, do this for your child beforehand.
   Have your child take the pieces and create a picture. Older children
   can use their creativity. For younger children, you will likely need to
   give direction (like, let's make a cat with these shapes).
   Have your child glue the pieces in place and use crayons to add some
   details to make the picture if desired.
