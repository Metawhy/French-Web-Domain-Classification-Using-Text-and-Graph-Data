A Bond of Brothers in Onward

   A Bond of Brothers in Onward
     * April 5, 2019
     * Season 3

   Two of the best teams in the Onward circuit have something special in
   common. Both teams have a pair of brothers who practice, strategize,
   play, and travel to events together in a time when many adults don‚Äôt
   talk with their siblings for months.

   The concept that virtual reality will isolate people is not only false,
   but in fact those who use VR have actually found the opposite to be
   true. VR is so immersive that it‚Äôs actually bringing people closer
   together, including families. VR esports is one way this is evident.

   Texas brothers Luke and Jeremy Kotin, started playing Onward, the
   popular VR first-person shooter when it was released in early access in
   August 2016. They had purchased their VR setups only about a week
   earlier.

   ‚ÄúWe absolutely loved the game from day one and talked about doing
   tournaments even before we had discovered the [Onward] Discord,‚Äù says
   Luke Kotin (Thund3rPilot).

   In early 2017, they got their wish when DaKinMan established the VR
   Master League, a community driven platform where Onward enthusiasts can
   find teammates and coordinate competitive games through the VRML. Dante
   Buckley, the creator of Onward, and the VRML collaborated with the VR
   League in 2017 to present Onward as part of VRL Season 2. It is also
   one of the four featured games for VR League Season 3.

   Luke and Jeremy (Auto), who had been playing games together since they
   were young, formed Globochem in VRML season one. They lived together at
   that time, but since then Luke moved about 10 hours away to go to
   school.

   Playing competitive VR esports has allowed them to remain in close
   contact even though they no longer live together.

   ‚ÄúI love playing with my brother,‚Äù explains Luke. ‚ÄúOur familiarity and
   trust is a great foundation for our team and going into battle with him
   is so much fun. We just seem to know where the other will be, what they
   are thinking before they do it, and ways to support [each other]
   without any communication.‚Äù

   Both brothers say they appreciate the positive attitude of the other.

   ‚ÄúPlaying with Thund3rPilot is awesome,‚Äù says Jeremy, using Luke‚Äôs
   gamertag. ‚ÄúHe has so much passion for the game and our team. He‚Äôs an
   excellent teammate and one of the top players in Onward. ‚Ä¶ I feel
   fortunate to be able to play this game competitively with my brother.‚Äù

   Another pair of well-known brothers in Onward is on Beginners in the
   European region.

   Carl, 37, better known as Woods43, began playing within a week or so
   after the game released while Dean, 38, watched from the sidelines.

   ‚ÄúMy brother started playing before me,‚Äù says Dean (ICWoods). ‚ÄúI
   thought, ‚ÄòWow. I wouldn‚Äôt mind having a go of that.‚Äô‚Äù

   About six months after his brother began playing, ICWoods joined the
   VRML with BossFight. He later received an invite to his brother‚Äôs team.
   He has played with Beginners since VRML Season 5 and now plays with
   them in VR League Season 3.

   The Woods brothers do have the opportunity to see each other regularly
   since they both live in Liverpool, England, but playing VR together
   gives them the opportunity to retain the closeness they had growing up.

   The success of the Woods and Kotin brothers has inspired other players
   such as Snakebite and LionHeartVR from Spokane, Washington.

   They live down the street from each other and have never played on an
   official team together, but they do run into each other in Onward
   lobbies so they can join the same match.

   ‚ÄúOur playstyle is more a sledgehammer rather than a surgical pick,‚Äù
   explains LionHeartVR, 32. ‚ÄúIf you saw us coordinating, it would most
   likely be an aggressive smoke and rush play rather than slow play.‚Äù

   ‚ÄúPlaying with him is very fun and challenging,‚Äù says Snakebite, 29,
   repeating a sentiment we hear repeatedly from people who play with
   their siblings, spouses, and even parents. ‚ÄúWe do very well together
   strategically even against each other.‚Äù

   It seems like perhaps there is a slight advantage for these players who
   already have a lifetime of history and they‚Äôre able to transition those
   relationships naturally to the immersiveness of VR. Although obviously
   everyone doesn‚Äôt have a family member to play with, it‚Äôs great to see
   the positive dynamics developing between all players in VR esports.
   It‚Äôs also encouraging to see how these games can strengthen
   relationships, particularly between family members.
