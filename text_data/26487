BMC, research in progress

   A pioneer of open access publishing, BMC has an evolving portfolio of
   high quality peer-reviewed journals including broad interest titles
   such as BMC Biology and BMC Medicine, specialist journals such as
   Malaria Journal and Microbiome, and the BMC Series.
   Expanding beyond biomedicine into the physical sciences, mathematics
   and engineering disciplines, BMC now offers a wider portfolio of
   subject fields on a single open access platform.

   At BMC, research is always in progress. We are committed to continual
   innovation to better support the needs of our communities, ensuring the
   integrity of the research we publish, and championing the benefits of
   open research. BMC is part of Springer Nature.

Bonobo diet of aquatic greens may hold clues to human evolution

   Observations of bonobos in the Congo basin foraging in swamps for
   aquatic herbs rich in iodine, a critical nutrient for brain development
   and higher cognitive abilities, may explain how the nutritional needs
   of prehistoric humans in the region were met. This is the first report
   of iodine consumption by a nonhuman primate.

   What is a Data Note?

BMC Research Notes Launches Data Notes

   Data is becoming increasingly more important. Researchers tell us they
   want to share their data to progress research, to receive more credit
   and visibility for their work and to comply with funder policies.  To
   help our authors do this, we have launched the data note.

Open Access Funding Support Service

   Did you know that there almost 250 open access article processing
   charge (APC) funds available to researchers worldwide? At BMC, we offer
   a free advice service to help our authors to discover and apply for
   funding. On our support pages you can find our OA checklist along with
   a list of research funders and institutions that make APC funding
   available.

The Editors’ dilemma

   Prospective clinical trial registration aims to address publication and
   reporting bias. Unfortunately, not all clinical trials are registered
   before they start. Here we discuss the dilemma faced by editors when
   receiving submissions reporting a clinical trial that was not
   registered prospectively, and a new policy for increasing transparency
   when a trial was registered after participant recruitment has begun.

   Citizen science: through the looking glass

Citizen science

   In this blog, Poppy Lakeman Fraser, Senior Programme Coordinator for
   the Open Air Laboratories (OPAL) initiative, explains what citizen
   science actually is and how researchers rely on this form of data
   collection.
