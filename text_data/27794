Locker-style Dresser is finally done! 0 comments

   May 5, 2015 | Home Renovation
   Silas’s dresser went to the curb about a month ago, of course without
   having a replacement dresser. So he had nowhere to go with his clothes
   for the last month, and you can imagine what that looked like. I saw a
   plan on Ana White's blog for a Dumpster Dresser made out of 2 by 4s and
   figured it looked solid enough to withstand an F-4 tornado, or Silas,
   whichever came first. It is officially tornado season here in
   Nebraska...
   Now wouldn’t it be ironic if our house did get demolished by a tornado
   and this dresser was the only thing left standing? Don’t laugh, it’s
   happened before. You’ve heard the stories about the toilet or the front
   door, or even the dinner plates left on the kitchen table while the
   entire rest of the house is completely gone…

   Anyhow, we made some major modifications to the plan and ended up with
   a solid piece of furniture that will hopefully last the kid quite a few
   years. My favorite part is that there are no rails. Any parent who has
   had the lucky task of repairing and replacing drawer rails can feel my
   pain. We even built in a secret compartment (shhhh) into one of the
   drawers.

   A coat of navy blue and metallic latex and it’s finished!

Red, White & Blue Wedding Invitations 1 comment

   Sarah contacted me about designing the invitations for her 1940’s
   military-themed wedding. She knew she wanted a Red, White + Blue
   design, something with a suggestion of military, but not over-the-top.
   I designed up a simple invitation and rsvp card using what I would
   consider to be 40s-style fonts. Just a hint of military, but not too
   much.
   [military%2Bwedding%2Binvitation%2B8.jpg]
   I decided to go with a heavyweight linen duplex paper from Mohawk -
   navy blue on one side and white on the reverse. The invitations were
   screen printed using red and white ink.

   A vellum wrap featuring a vintage photo of the U.S.S. Midway from the
   1940’s keeps the suite neatly packaged. These were printed using a
   difficult (at least difficult to me!) technique - printing the
   photograph on one side, then screen printing a distressed white
   background on the reverse side.

Modern Country Wedding Invitations 1 comment

   Brittany is as casual a bride as they come. She knew she wanted coral
   and gold, and that was all she knew. The wedding was to be held in a
   pasture, with guests arriving by horse and carriage. The reception was
   to be held in an old barn, with wildflowers and tin buckets and
   anything rustic you could think of. Needless to say it was beautiful,
   and rustic and just plain fun. Two sets of invitations had to be
   printed: one invitation had to be for guests of the reception only, and
   the other, a more formal invitation (this one), was for guests invited
   to the ceremony.
   [IMG_7345_3.jpg]
   Everything was screen printed using a glitter gold ink and a custom
   coral color that Brittany chose. The invitations were then folded and
   sealed with a custom gold sticker stating “Gettin’ Hitched!”
   [IMG_6418.jpg]
   The gold glitter ink was just phenomenal to work with. Love the crisp,
   clean edges.

   The envelopes had each address screenprinted on individually using
   white ink and a couple of western fonts. The return address was also
   screenprinted on the back flap using white ink.

Navy Blue + Kraft Wedding Invites 0 comments

   Apr 7, 2014 | In the Studio, Invitations
   Thanks again to Ashli and Caden for allowing me the opportunity to
   create their wedding invitations!
   I had so much fun creating this rustic suite that will nicely
   compliment the theme of their wedding {navy + ivory, burlap, lace and
   mason jars among other very cool things!}. Ashli and I both liked the
   look and feel of brown Kraft paper, so I decided to screenprint the
   suite using navy and ivory inks on kraft paper for the invites, and a
   navy blue linen for the cover of the booklet.
   Talk about labor-intensive, but it was well worth it! In addition to
   the main 5 x 7 invitation, a little booklet was included that contained
   all the wedding details, including ceremony and reception information,
   a simple fold-out map, rsvp and registry information. The booklet was
   wrapped in a lovely navy paper that I screenprinted with ivory ink,
   then was tied together with burlap threads. I just heard from the
   mother of the bride that the invitations have been successfully mailed
   and are on their way!

   Here we are all set up and ready to go. A mob of crazy women was
   lingering just outside the door. We had just taken bets on what would
   be the first to go. I put my money on the ladder + crows…

   If you look really closely, you can see a tear in Mary’s eye. Oh, why,
   Oh, why, will nobody buy, will nobody buy, the ladder and crows?!? She
   blows her nose. Who really knows, why someone bought those, but nobody
   chose, the ladder and crows.
   [IMG_5071.JPG]
   Our new friend back there. She gave us lots and lots and lots of good
   advice. And then she gave us the eye for not charging more on some of
   our stuff.

   Pa waving good-bye. See ya later McCook! It’s been fun! [IMG_5073.JPG]

Book Cover: Killer Sleepover 0 comments

   Nov 5, 2013 | In the Studio
   Eddie and I started working on this cover for his book “Killer
   Sleepover” during the summer as the book was in the final editing
   stage. It’s now officially 100% done and off to the publisher today!!!
   Happy birthday to me! Yippee!
   [KillerSleepover+book+cover+art.jpg]
   Here is the original sketch. No sketch was needed for the back cover.
   That was done entirely in Photoshop.
   [img026.jpg]
   Should be a good read. I can’t wait to get my hands on a copy. I think
   it will only be available online, so you’ll have to be sure and check
   it out!
