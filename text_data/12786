   While Amazon has a good structure for temporary employees, for
   employees seeking long term employment this can prove to very
   challenging. Payment structures could also improve based on individual
   employee statistics. Shift scheduling is another area that could use
   major improvements.

   My opinion
   UK Retail CSA (Former Employee) –  Cape Town, Western Cape – 29 August
   2019
   Management not understanding to employees health. Only top performers
   get better working hours and other benefits. Not a family orientated
   organisation.

   Customer Service Representative (Former Employee) –  Cape Town, Western
   Cape – 21 August 2019
   The company is very big on culture, which I admire. Meeting people who
   all want to be their best in a high pressured environment. I learned a
   lot. Different people from different cultures and religions, it helps
   you open your mind. You learn the American people also, from the calls.
   You have people who want you to tell them about South Africa.
   It is a good company to work for.

   Lots of growth opportunity, friendly faces, safe place, support, they
   really look out for their employees. You get medical aid so when you
   apply for gym at virgin active you get 75% off. There's a canteen with
   healthy food. There's free WiFi. There are little lounges to take naps
   during lounges.
   Pros
   Many breaks and a long lunch

   Get fired easily.

   Once again, I'm giving Amazon a 5-star experience, this time due to its
   excellence in how the treat their employees. I have learned a lot from
   them not just in a working environment but also self discipline.

   Good for entry level development
   Customer Service Associate (Former Employee) –  Cape Town, Western Cape
   – 22 July 2019
   Has a fun culture where they try to provide opportunity for
   development, however as it is with human nature and a bunch of people
   put together, the nasty side of our competitive nature seemed to be
   winning the corporate culture war.
   The opportunities mainly revolve around customer service for the
   various amazon owned companies, but there is opportunity in HR,
   training, IT, AWS.
   Pros
   Nice Canteen

   Potentially weird shifts

   Amazon - Seller Support
   SPS partner associate (Former Employee) –  Cape Town, Western Cape – 22
   July 2019
   Each day began with team meeting which outliers and accomplishments,
   mapping the day ahead. Wonderful place to learn how to work together
   and very transparent to how each function/role contributes to the
   business as a whole.
   I learned how to be a how to better manage company expectations, be a
   mentor and lead and edify my peers with the knowledge i was exposed to
   due to my constant performance.
   Managers were great people and open door policy was truly shown at this
   company and it was made easy as they really only employed those who fit
   in with company culture as opposed to just doing the job.
   The hardest part of the job was relying on other teams/departments
   based abroad providing par service standards to what we were well-known
   for. Basically, numbers over quality.
   The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with. No factions of
   any sort, to each is their own and we were all individuals but who
   worked together and stood together. That I accredit to the recruiters
   and the principles of the company.
   Pros
   free parking and breakfast cereals and coffee.
   Cons
   lacked growth potentiial at local site.

   Great Company, with Horrible Management
   Customer Service Associate (Former Employee) –  Cape Town, Western Cape
   – 18 July 2019
   Working at Amazon used to be such an enjoyable experience, that was
   before managers (especially in the North American department) felt as
   though the company belonged to them. Customer service agents are
   exploited and not treated with the same respect and courtesy that
   management feels entitled to. Shifts are ridiculous and very
   inconvenient for mist agents who still would have to use their own
   transport to commute home, and actually arrive much later than expected
   AND still be expected to be well rested for a shift. The fact that you
   do not feel secure in your job due to managers who are autocratic
   bullies makes working at Amazon a nightmare. I used to really enjoy
   working there, but not anymore.
   Pros
   Transport for unsociable hours and public holidays, potlucks, salary,
   canteen, medical aid, provident fund.
   Cons
   Long tedious hours, hectic shifts, poor management, bullying by
   management.

   Lack of opportunities
   Technical Support Agent (Current Employee) –  Cape Town, Western Cape –
   15 July 2019
   Amazon is a company that thrives on customer service, and will do
   everything to provide excellent customer service. However there is a
   lack of opportunities to progress in the company, and those that are
   able to progress to higher positions are those of a "superior" race.
   There is still favoritism in the company. The salary is really good for
   a place where minimal experience is needed, but it is a really draining
   job, and new skills are constantly being added to those you already
   have, albeit with no remuneration for them. The people really make the
   place, and without them the company would really suffer.
   Pros
   People, Workspace
   Cons
   Lack of leadership, Overworked and underpaid

   Worst experience in Leadership career
   Digital Manager (Former Employee) –  Cape Town, Western Cape – 8 July

   To be honest , I have lost my respect for Amazon because of my

   Even if this is an option, I’d rather be in BPO and with Leadership
   that has demonstrated respect and integrity.

   Relaxed workplace
   Customer Service Associate (Former Employee) –  Cape Town – 2 July 2019
   As a Customer Service Associate every day brings a new challenge. You
   manage yourself keeping in mind that the main objective is to keep all
   Amazon customers happy by any means necessary. Like the logo, do
   whatever it takes to make every customer's interaction end in a smile.
   Management is very lenient in all aspects. They are always willing to
   go the extra mile and treat you as an equal more than them being your
   superior.
   Culture within the call centre is way past relaxed. Because it consists
   mainly of young adults between 19 and 35 . No dress code, so you can
   come to work as you please, within reason of course. But to give an
   example, on the night shifts agents come dressed in pajamas or rather
   onezies to be more specific. And Amazon encourages each and every
   person to be there own individuals and treat every one with respect. No
   matter what race, religion, gender or sexual preference. Every one is
   free to be who they are and express themselves they way they feel.
   The hardest part of the job is going home at the end of the day. Just
   because the job, the people and customers grow on you. Helping customer
   and puting a smile on every customers face the most enjoyable part of
   the job because you really have the freedom and the ability to do just
   that.
   Pros
   - Have the ability to make decisions without prior authorizations.
   Cons
   - You are held responsible for the decisions that you make.

   While Amazon has a good structure for temporary employees, for
   employees seeking long term employment this can prove to very
   challenging. Payment structures could also improve based on individual
   employee statistics. Shift scheduling is another area that could use
   major improvements.

   Management not understanding to employees health. Only top performers

   Customer Service Representative (Former Employee) –  Cape Town, Western

   The company is very big on culture, which I admire. Meeting people who
   all want to be their best in a high pressured environment. I learned a
   lot. Different people from different cultures and religions, it helps
   you open your mind. You learn the American people also, from the calls.
   You have people who want you to tell them about South Africa.
   It is a good company to work for.

   Lots of growth opportunity, friendly faces, safe place, support, they
   really look out for their employees. You get medical aid so when you
   apply for gym at virgin active you get 75% off. There's a canteen with
   healthy food. There's free WiFi. There are little lounges to take naps
   during lounges.
   Pros
   Many breaks and a long lunch

   Get fired easily.

   Good for entry level development
   Customer Service Associate (Former Employee) –  Cape Town, Western Cape
   – 22 July 2019
   Has a fun culture where they try to provide opportunity for
   development, however as it is with human nature and a bunch of people
   put together, the nasty side of our competitive nature seemed to be
   winning the corporate culture war.
   The opportunities mainly revolve around customer service for the
   various amazon owned companies, but there is opportunity in HR,
   training, IT, AWS.
   Pros
   Nice Canteen
   Cons

   Amazon - Seller Support
   SPS partner associate (Former Employee) –  Cape Town, Western Cape – 22
   July 2019
   Each day began with team meeting which outliers and accomplishments,
   mapping the day ahead. Wonderful place to learn how to work together
   and very transparent to how each function/role contributes to the
   business as a whole.
   I learned how to be a how to better manage company expectations, be a
   mentor and lead and edify my peers with the knowledge i was exposed to
   due to my constant performance.
   Managers were great people and open door policy was truly shown at this
   company and it was made easy as they really only employed those who fit
   in with company culture as opposed to just doing the job.
   The hardest part of the job was relying on other teams/departments
   based abroad providing par service standards to what we were well-known
   for. Basically, numbers over quality.
   The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with. No factions of
   any sort, to each is their own and we were all individuals but who
   worked together and stood together. That I accredit to the recruiters
   and the principles of the company.
   Pros
   free parking and breakfast cereals and coffee.
   Cons
   lacked growth potentiial at local site.

   Great Company, with Horrible Management
   Customer Service Associate (Former Employee) –  Cape Town, Western Cape
   – 18 July 2019
   Working at Amazon used to be such an enjoyable experience, that was
   before managers (especially in the North American department) felt as
   though the company belonged to them. Customer service agents are
   exploited and not treated with the same respect and courtesy that
   management feels entitled to. Shifts are ridiculous and very
   inconvenient for mist agents who still would have to use their own
   transport to commute home, and actually arrive much later than expected
   AND still be expected to be well rested for a shift. The fact that you
   do not feel secure in your job due to managers who are autocratic
   bullies makes working at Amazon a nightmare. I used to really enjoy
   working there, but not anymore.
   Pros
   Transport for unsociable hours and public holidays, potlucks, salary,
   canteen, medical aid, provident fund.
   Cons
   Long tedious hours, hectic shifts, poor management, bullying by
   management.

   Lack of opportunities
   Technical Support Agent (Current Employee) –  Cape Town, Western Cape –
   15 July 2019
   Amazon is a company that thrives on customer service, and will do
   everything to provide excellent customer service. However there is a
   lack of opportunities to progress in the company, and those that are
   able to progress to higher positions are those of a "superior" race.
   There is still favoritism in the company. The salary is really good for
   a place where minimal experience is needed, but it is a really draining
   job, and new skills are constantly being added to those you already
   have, albeit with no remuneration for them. The people really make the
   place, and without them the company would really suffer.
   Pros
   People, Workspace
   Cons
   Lack of leadership, Overworked and underpaid

   Advanced Technician (Current Employee) –  Cape Town, Western Cape – 12
   July 2019
   Working at Amazon is always brilliant! Great company to work for and
   perfect workplace for growth and development.
   I guess this is why Amazon is one of the best companies in the world.
   I am relocating which is why I won't have the option to stay at Amazon.
   Pros
   Vibrant Environment
   Cons

   Worst experience in Leadership career
   Digital Manager (Former Employee) –  Cape Town, Western Cape – 8 July
   2019
   To be honest , I have lost my respect for Amazon because of my
   experience and the toxic culture.
   Even if this is an option, I’d rather be in BPO and with Leadership
   that has demonstrated respect and integrity.
   Pros

   Relaxed workplace
   Customer Service Associate (Former Employee) –  Cape Town – 2 July 2019
   As a Customer Service Associate every day brings a new challenge. You
   manage yourself keeping in mind that the main objective is to keep all
   Amazon customers happy by any means necessary. Like the logo, do
   whatever it takes to make every customer's interaction end in a smile.
   Management is very lenient in all aspects. They are always willing to
   go the extra mile and treat you as an equal more than them being your
   superior.
   Culture within the call centre is way past relaxed. Because it consists
   mainly of young adults between 19 and 35 . No dress code, so you can
   come to work as you please, within reason of course. But to give an
   example, on the night shifts agents come dressed in pajamas or rather
   onezies to be more specific. And Amazon encourages each and every
   person to be there own individuals and treat every one with respect. No
   matter what race, religion, gender or sexual preference. Every one is
   free to be who they are and express themselves they way they feel.
   The hardest part of the job is going home at the end of the day. Just
   because the job, the people and customers grow on you. Helping customer
   and puting a smile on every customers face the most enjoyable part of
   the job because you really have the freedom and the ability to do just
   that.
   Pros
   - Have the ability to make decisions without prior authorizations.
   Cons
   - You are held responsible for the decisions that you make.

   retail (Former Employee) –  Pretoria, Gauteng – 18 August 2019
   It's good startup to a student to work on this company me I am looking
   for upgrade because it's no longer reach my cost of life due to
   financial. Because in life you need to have references from companies
   for you to be able to find a job and be a hard worker so that company
   gave me a good experience, how to heddle different types of people so
   that why am good at communicating

   Depending on the kind of people you are working with on the shift,it
   can be a great day. Learned to work calmly under pressure and be
   proactive
   crew member (Current Employee) –  Mayville Pretoria – 13 August 2019
   It is a great company to work for but sometimes the environment can be
   extremely stressful because of different factors. It's a fast paced
   environment and pushes you to work under pressure. It's a better
   environment when you are working as a team.

   Fun at work
   Teller/Cashier (Former Employee) –  Parow, Western Cape – 12 August
   2019
   manage cash register
   attend to client's orders
   build rapport
   weekdays it's manageable but weekends there is a lot of food traffic
   queue and orders which needs undivided attention but a lot of focus.
   Once the cash register makes an inviting comeback (open/closing each
   time) that lets you know that things are just starting to take off.
   Hardest part - is to work doubleshift due to one of the staff to
   replace you when your shift ends, has not pitched up for work - you
   have to arrange transport on the last minute.
   Hours are not steady
   Enjoy - customer service / interact with customers
   Pros
   free lunch
   Cons
   double shift

   flexi (Former Employee) –  Brackenfell, Western Cape – 23 July 2019
   I really had a great experience at Mc Donalds. I was always happy to be
   there and the only thing that stood out for me was team work. We were
   working very hard to make sure that we serve the best for customers
   even though there were tough times when some staff members do not
   co-operate. The management was hands on and they were doing their best
   to make sure that everyone is happy and satisfied.

   It's good startup to a student to work on this company me I am looking
   for upgrade because it's no longer reach my cost of life due to
   financial. Because in life you need to have references from companies
   for you to be able to find a job and be a hard worker so that company
   gave me a good experience, how to heddle different types of people so
   that why am good at communicating

   Depending on the kind of people you are working with on the shift,it
   can be a great day. Learned to work calmly under pressure and be
   proactive
   crew member (Current Employee) –  Mayville Pretoria – 13 August 2019
   It is a great company to work for but sometimes the environment can be
   extremely stressful because of different factors. It's a fast paced
   environment and pushes you to work under pressure. It's a better
   environment when you are working as a team.

   Fun at work
   Teller/Cashier (Former Employee) –  Parow, Western Cape – 12 August
   2019
   manage cash register
   attend to client's orders
   build rapport
   weekdays it's manageable but weekends there is a lot of food traffic
   queue and orders which needs undivided attention but a lot of focus.
   Once the cash register makes an inviting comeback (open/closing each
   time) that lets you know that things are just starting to take off.
   Hardest part - is to work doubleshift due to one of the staff to
   replace you when your shift ends, has not pitched up for work - you
   have to arrange transport on the last minute.
   Hours are not steady
   Enjoy - customer service / interact with customers
   Pros
   free lunch
   Cons
   double shift

   fun workplace
   flexi (Former Employee) –  Brackenfell, Western Cape – 23 July 2019
   I really had a great experience at Mc Donalds. I was always happy to be
   there and the only thing that stood out for me was team work. We were
   working very hard to make sure that we serve the best for customers
   even though there were tough times when some staff members do not
   co-operate. The management was hands on and they were doing their best
   to make sure that everyone is happy and satisfied.
