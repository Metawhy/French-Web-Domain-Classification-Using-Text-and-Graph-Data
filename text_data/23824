    I'm Tanya, organic gardener, soap maker, beekeeper, and green living
                                 enthusiast.

   Here on Lovely Greens you'll find fresh ideas for growing useful plants
   and creatively using them in the home. It could be growing flowers for
    handmade soap, vegetables for homemade meals, or herbs for health. I
   also share how you can connect with others, whether it's by growing in
    an allotment garden, sharing the harvest, or organizing a seed swap.
