Local news is dead. Long live local news.

   News

   Ad revenues are declining, the core print business is shifting and
   business models have to be adapted in times of digitalization. Many
   media companies are struggling and financial strains have been taking
   their toll on news organisations, especially local ones. But it’s not
   all bad, and transformation can be a positive thing.

The Year In Polls: How readers responded to 12 major events in 2018

   News

   2018 has been a whirlwind year in the news. With Brexit, Trump, Russia,
   North Korea, the World Cup, and countless other events making
   headlines, it wouldn’t be surprising if you forgot half of the year’s
   most important events. Now it’s the festive season, we thought we’d
   take a look back at what was driving readers to share their opinions
   throughout the year.

January: Stormy Daniels

   The year’s news started with a bang (so to speak), as news broke that
   adult film star Stormy Daniels had allegedly had an affair with US
   President Donald Trump and been paid $130,000 to stay silent about it
   ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Paid through a shell company
   set up by Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, suspicions started
   to arise that the payment itself might not be entirely legitimate, as
   seen in this NBC Think poll.

February: Winter Olympics

   The 2018 Winter Olympics were co-hosted by South and North Korea,
   despite half a century of clashes and tensions between the two. This
   year saw something of a re-brand on North Korea’s part, which began
   with the show it put on at the Olympics. Most NBC Think readers thought
   North Korea’s efforts amounted to little more than a propaganda stunt.

March: Salisbury Poisonings

   Former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned
   in Salisbury, England in March, throwing UK-Russia relations into
   crisis. UK Prime Minister Theresa May demanded an explanation from
   Russian premier Vladimir Putin as the nerve agent used was developed in
   the former Soviet Union and Skripal had also fed information to
   Britain, putting him at risk of assassination. HuffPost UK readers
   thought Russia posed a very serious threat, while Times Red Box readers
   thought Theresa May’s response would be met with laughter in Russia.

April: Cambridge Analytica

   April saw Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg testify before Congress
   about the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which data from 87 million
   Facebook user profiles were bought by elections consultancy Cambridge
   Analytica to produce individualised political advertisements. This is
   how HuffPost UK and Moneyish readers saw the ordeal.

May: Yanny or Laurel

   In our politically turbulent times, it’s important to know that people
   will scream at each other online about very very silly things as well.
   A distorted voice saying something heard as “Yanny” or “Laurel” at
   different frequencies went viral on social media, dividing the internet
   into Team Yanny and Team Laurel. The Evening Standard, indy100 and
   HuffPost UK posed the question to its readers:

June: World Cup 2018

   The 2018 FIFA World Cup was held in Russia this summer, beginning in
   June with the final between France and Croatia in July. Opinary users
   were very excited about all soccer-related polls, with questions about
   who would win each match garnering thousands and tens of thousands of
   votes. Of the 35 most popular polls in July, 31 were about the World
   Cup. Readers were flocking to share their views on the football
   competition, with engagement rates on World Cup polls up to 2x higher
   than average.

   Despite the optimistic atmosphere in England as fans put their faith in
   Gareth Southgate, Germans were much less confident about their chances
   of winning the trophy. This timeshift from Süddeutsche Zeitung shows
   how the nation slowly came to terms with their performance. There was a
   peak around May 25th when training started and as star goalkeeper
   Manuel Neuer became fit to play, but swiftly dropped as the team lost
   to Austria and gave a lackluster performance against Saudi Arabia.
   Readers became slightly more optimistic after the German team rallied
   against Sweden and fans anticipated an easy win over South Korea,
   though we now know things didn’t go so well.

July: Thai Cave Rescue

   The world was captivated in July by the story of 12 Thai children and
   their soccer coach trapped in Tham Luang cave, miraculously surviving
   their ordeal before being rescued by divers. Elon Musk wanted to get
   involved, designing a mini submarine to help some of the children, who
   could not swim, escape from the cave – but the craft was deemed unfit
   for purpose by divers familiar with Tham Luang. HuffPost UK readers
   suspected that Musk’s involvement was more of a PR stunt than anything
   else.

August: Alex Jones

   In August, InfoWars host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was banned
   from social media outlets and had content removed from YouTube and
   Spotify after his rhetoric was deemed islamophobic and racist. This
   sparked outrage about censorship of right-wing content, with many
   claiming large corporations were biased against their views.

September: Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court Battle

   September saw the confirmation hearings of now US Supreme Court Justice
   Brett Kavanaugh, rocked by Dr Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations that
   Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her as a teenager. This led to multiple
   accusers coming forward to share their stories about Kavanaugh,
   splitting the nation as President Trump and many Republican supporters
   of the then-nominee disputed Dr Ford’s claims. Many demanded a delay to
   the scheduled vote while the FBI investigated the alleged assault. NBC
   Think asked its voters whether the vote should be delayed:

October: Jamal Khashoggi

   Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi disappeared in October
   after he was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Turkey. It was
   suspected the Saudi government was to blame for the disappearance, with
   many world leaders calling on Saudi Arabia’s Prince Mohammed Bin Salman
   for an explanation. Donald Trump remained reluctant to condemn or
   criticise the Saudi Crown Prince, citing the amount of money and jobs
   the US gains from business with the country. Barron’s readers believed
   the time had come for the States to cut business ties with the regime
   once and for all.

November: US Mid-term elections

   The US mid-term elections were held on November 6, Donald Trump’s first
   real electoral test since being elected president. Given the media
   attention afforded to more progressive candidates such as Alexandria
   Ocasio-Cortez, there were optimistic forecasts for the Democrats’
   chances, even though Republicans controlled the House, Senate and
   president.
   NBC Think voters suspected the Democrats would come out of the battle
   better off than the Republicans, but in the end the GOP made gains in
   the Senate while conceding the House to the Democrats.

December: Brexit Deal Vote Delayed

   December has seen some chaotic upsets in the UK around Theresa May’s
   proposed Brexit deal. The government was found to be in contempt of
   Parliament. A TV debate between May and Labour Party leader Jeremy
   Corbyn was scheduled by two separate networks, squabbled over and then
   cancelled. And on the day of Parliament’s vote on the deal, May
   postponed it, anticipating defeat. She then faced off a no confidence
   vote sparked by rebellions from her own MPs. With the March 29, 2019
   exit deadline looming large on the horizon and no agreeable deal in
   sight, Yahoo News poses the question: what if the whole thing were just
   called off?

   Brexit has been one of the biggest and most divisive topics of the
   year. Here’s what readers had to say on the topic of a second
   referendum.

   If you want a more in-depth look at users’ Brexit sentiments, check out
   this post from the Opinary blog.

   That’s all for this year – all the best for 2019 from everyone at
   Opinary.

How we receive information

   We receive information (including possibly personal information) from
   different sources.
     * If you voluntarily provide us your personal details within our
       Services (for example by registering, using your Publisher
       Dashboard access or by subscribing to our newsletter)
     * If you visit the opinary.com homepage or using our dashboard
     * From third party websites and services where our tools are embedded

Uses

   Opinary GmbH offers a service that allows users to vote on editorial as
   well as sponsored polls. In this context, our service automatically
   stores a cookie on the user’s computer, which allows us to summarize
   voting results in a statistically meaningful way and to optimize our
   service and the information presented in the interests of the user.
   This cookie is based on a randomized online identifier.

   The additional data collected will include the category of the content
   of the website visited, the type of Opinary Tools used, language of the
   content, browser, operating system, device type, location information,
   and whether you are voting or otherwise clicking or interacting with
   any content. This information is combined with the identifier to form a
   user profile. The user profile does not contain names, postal
   addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses or similar personal
   data.

   The data collected will be used, among other things, for the following
   purposes:
     * To generate relevant aggregates (without any reference to personal
       information) from our online polls, display them and make them
       available to our partners
     * To recommend products, services or other relevant polls
     * Improvement of our services
     * Protection against abuse
     * statistics

   If you do not want your data to be used this way, you can contradict
   via our Opt Out function:
   https://compass.pressekompass.net/static/optout.html

   —

   In addition, personal data will be collected by us only and only to the
   extent and for the purpose for which you provide us with the data, eg.
   in the context of a registration. Examples include marketing
   communications, any information requests from your side, or information
   we collect from you to enter into a business relationship.

   —

   Statistical information helps to understand trends and customer needs
   so that they can be utilised in new products and services as well as
   improving existing products and services. Opinary GmbH does not
   knowingly collect or store any information that enables us to determine
   the true identity of users, and we ensure that this will be impossible
   in the future, through regular auditing and encryption mechanisms.

Legal basis of data processing

   Our legal basis for the collection and use of the personal data
   described in this Privacy Policy depends on the personal data concerned
   and the specific context in which we collect it.

   Basically, the data processing takes place on the following legal
   bases:
     * With regard to data that you specify in forms, etc., with your
       consent, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR
     * in relation to the services you use to carry out a contract with
       you, Art. 6 (1) lit. b) GDPR
     * for the rest, in particular for statistical data and online
       identifiers, on the basis of legitimate interests, Art. 6 para. 1
       lit. f) GDPR

   When we collect and use your personal information for legitimate
   interests (or that of a third party), that interest is usually in the
   provision of our services and our commercial interests. For example,
   answering your inquiries, improving our tools and services, marketing
   or preventing illegal activity. We may have other legitimate interests
   and, if appropriate, we will make it clear to you at the relevant time
   within the tool which legitimate interests they are.

Data security measurements

   We have taken extensive technical and organizational measures to
   safeguard your information against possible risks, such as unauthorized
   access, unauthorized modification or dissemination, loss, destruction
   or misuse. You can contact us at privacy@opinary.com if you want to
   have a more granular outline of our Technical Security Measurements and
   Strategy.

   Actions include, but are not limited to, the safekeeping of your data
   in secure, firewall-protected, and through other means secured servers
   running at certified facilities. Strict internal guidelines determine
   who has access to and what volume of data within Opinary GmbH. In
   addition, it ensures that only Opinary GmbH employees have access to
   your personal information and we are constantly working to improve our
   security standards when appropriate new technologies become available.

   In order to protect your personal data from unauthorized third-party
   access during transmission, we secure the data transmissions using SSL
   encryption if necessary. It is a standardized encryption method for
   online services, especially for the Web.

   While we perform the steps outlined above to ensure that your data is
   safe in our system, data transmission over the Internet can not be
   guaranteed to be 100% secure. For that reason, we cannot guarantee the
   security of the information you provide to us. You do this at your own
   risk.

Your rights

     * You have the right to request information as to whether and which
       personal data we process through you. You also have the right to
       request the correction of your personal data or its completion.
     * In certain circumstances, you have the right to request that your
       personal information be deleted.
     * In certain circumstances, you have the right to request that the
       processing of your personal data be restricted.
     * You may withdraw your consent to the processing and use of your
       data in whole or in part at any time with future effect.
     * You have the right to receive your personal information in a
       standard, structured and machine-readable format.
     * If you have any questions, comments or complaints or requests for
       information in connection with our privacy policy and the
       processing of your personal data, you can contact our data
       protection officer in writing.
     * You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant
       regulatory authority if you believe that the processing of your
       personal data violates the law.

   You can contact us for questions about the above points at
   privacy@opinary.com.

   We respond to any requests we receive from individuals wishing to
   exercise their privacy rights in accordance with applicable privacy
   laws.

Requirement or obligation to provide data

   Unless specifically stated in the survey/poll, the provision of data is
   not required or mandatory.

Data transmission to third countries

   Data may be transferred to third countries outside the European Union.
   This is done on the basis of legally provided contractual arrangements,
   which should ensure an adequate protection of your data.

   All our communications are protected by the standard contractual
   clauses and data processing contracts of the European Commission, as
   provided for in the European Data Protection Act. You can see these

Web analytics

   Like almost every website operator, we use tracking software analysis
   tools to determine the frequency and number of users on our website.

   In order to optimize this website and our services, we use Google
   Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”).
   Google Analytics uses cookies, text files that are stored on your
   computer and enable an analysis of your use of the website. The
   information generated by the cookie about your use of this website
   (including your IP address) will be transmitted to a Google server in
   the USA and stored there. However, if you enable IP anonymization on
   this website, your Google IP address will be truncated beforehand
   within Member States of the European Union or in other signatory states
   to the EEA Agreement. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address
   transferred to a Google server in the USA and truncated there. On
   behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this
   information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on
   website activity for the website operator and to provide further
   services associated with the use of the website and the Internet to the
   website operator.

   The IP address transmitted by your browser within the scope of Google
   Analytics will not be merged with other Google data. You can prevent
   the storage of cookies by setting your browser software accordingly;
   however, we would like to point out that in this case you may not be
   able to use all the functions of this website and our tools and
   services to their full extent. You can also prevent Google from

   to point out that on this website Google Analytics has been extended by
   the code “gat._anonymizeIp();” in order to guarantee an anonymous
   capture of IP addresses (so-called IP masking).

   We use Google AdWords Remarketing to advertise Opinary across the
   Internet. AdWords remarketing will display relevant ads tailored to you
   based on what parts of the Opinary website you have viewed by placing a
   cookie on your machine. This cookie does not in anyway identify you or

Logfiles

   Every time you access our Internet pages, usage data is transmitted

     * Date and time of retrieval
     * IP address of the accessing computer
     * Website (s) that the user visits as part of the offer
     * Transmitted amount of data, browser type and version

       your consent
     * if we need the data to execute a contract, at most as long as the
       contractual relationship with you or statutory retention periods
       are in effect,
     * if we use the data on the basis of a legitimate interest, at most
       as long as your interest in deletion or anonymization does not
       prevail. All personally identifiable information (PII) information
       that we collect from you will be processed after a period of one
       year in such a way that the personal connection to an original
       person can no longer be established.

   Opinary may refer to the website of third parties that provide useful
   information / services. All information that the user makes available
   on the linked pages is passed on directly to these third-party
   providers and is subject to the privacy policy of the respective

   practices of websites it links to. Links from Opinary’s Service to
   third parties or other websites are provided for the convenience of the
   user. You should consult the privacy policies of each website before
   providing them with personal information.

Social networks

Facebook

   Facebook is operated by Facebook Inc. of 1601 S. California Ave, Palo
   Alto, CA 94304, USA and is available at www.facebook.de. These
   individual social plugins are identified by one of the Facebook logos
   or with the addition “Facebook Social Plugin”. A list of the appearance
   and functions of each plugin can be found here: developers.
   facebook.com/docs/plugins. When you access a page of our website that
   contains such a social plugin, the browser you are using will establish
   a direct connection to Facebook’s servers. The content of the social
   plugin is sent directly from Facebook to your browser and integrated
   into the website by your browser. We have no control over the amount of
   data that Facebook collects using the social plugins, and therefore we
   would like to inform you about this to the best of our knowledge: Due
   to the inclusion of the social plugins, Facebook will be informed that
   you have visited the corresponding page of our website, even if you are
   not registered as a Facebook user or not logged in to Facebook. This
   information is sent from your browser to a Facebook server in the
   United States together with your IP address and saved there. According
   to the information provided by Facebook, only an anonymous IP address
   of non-registered users in Germany is stored. If you are logged in to
   Facebook, Facebook can make a connection between your Facebook account
   and visiting our website. Facebook receives information about your
   visit to our website regardless of whether you interact with the social
   plugins or not.

   If you interact with the social plugins, for example by clicking on the
   “Like” button or by submitting a comment, the corresponding information
   is sent directly from your browser to Facebook and stored there. The
   information is also published on Facebook and displayed to your
   Facebook friends. For the purpose and scope of data collection and
   further processing and use of the data by Facebook, as well as your
   rights and options for privacy protection, please refer to Facebook’s
   Privacy Policy, which is available at www.facebook.com/about/privacy.
   If you are a registered user of Facebook and do not want Facebook to
   collect information about you through our website and link it to your
   Facebook-membership data, you must log out of Facebook before visiting
   our website. It is also possible to block the social plugins with
   add-ons for your browser, such as Facebook Blocker,
   webgraph.com/resources/facebookblocker.

Twitter

   This website uses the buttons of the Twitter service provided by
   Twitter Inc., 1355 Market St, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA.
   These plugins are recognizable by terms such as “Twitter” or “Tweet” or
   the Twitter logo. They allow you to share a post or a page of this
   website on Twitter. When a user accesses a web page that contains such
   a button, his browser establishes a direct connection to Twitter’s
   servers. The content of the Twitter button is sent directly to the
   user’s browser by Twitter. We have no influence on the amount of data
   that Twitter collects with the help of this plugin and can therefore
   only inform the user according to our knowledge: Afterwards, log data
   such as the IP address of the user, the previously accessed website,
   etc. are transmitted. For more information, please see the Twitter
   Privacy Policy at twitter.com/privacy.

Status of this Privacy Policy
