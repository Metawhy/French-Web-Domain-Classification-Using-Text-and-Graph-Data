Our Philosophy

   We go to extraordinary lengths to ensure that every element of our menu
   has been grown or reared ourselves or sourced from local Dorset
   suppliers who we feel share our ideals. Every dish has been carefully
   designed around the best of the season and showcases the amazing
   produce that our beautiful region has to offer.

   We keep a herd of rare breed Oxford, Sandy and Black pigs as well as
   our lovely chickens and we are soon to be home to another small herd of
   Poll Dorset sheep and lambs. We have bees as well and this year we hope
   to have more of our lovely honey to use at The Tickled Pig.
