   I’m a Senior Staff Software Engineer at Criteo. I’m probably best known
   for creating Play, the framework for easily building web applications
   with Java & Scala.

   I have 15 years of experience working on various software engineering
   projects. I have designed many large scale system, API, services &
   distributed architectures. I also like developing user facing
   applications, doing Front-End & UI development.

   These days I'm working on the infrastructure and the platform allowing
   Criteo to deal with the Peta Bytes of data used by our Analytics &
   Machine Learning pipelines (aka Big Data).

   Prior to Criteo:
    1. I co-founded Zengularity with my friend Habib. The company has been
       acquired since by Fabernovel.
    2. I launched prismic.io with my friend Sadek.
    3. I helped large companies such as LinkedIn or Apple to integrate the
       Play framework into their stack.
    4. I participated to the launch of Lightbend (previously known as
       Typesafe) by bringing a Scala web framework to the stack.
    5. I worked at INRIA in a research team focused on distributed work.
