     * Cinturato P1 test
     * Note this tyre

   The Italian manufacturer Pirelli was declared favourite by renowned
   automobile magazines after the summer tires tests, held in Germany, in
   2006. Very appreciated by the critics, these tires received attributes
   going from "very recommended" to "highly recommended". Founded in
   Milan, at the end of the 19th century Pirelli has definitely won its
   place among the greatest tire manufacturers in the world. Design and
   high technology: the Italians imposed their marks on the field with
   their perception of the tire mixing both the technical perfection and
   the most "design" aesthetics. In 2004, Pirelli "showed off" with
   Subaru, in the World Rally Championship. More recently they have become
   associates with Ford, who chose Pirelli as a strategic partner in 2006.

   The Italian manufacturer Pirelli was declared favourite by renowned
   automobile magazines after the summer tires tests, held in Germany, in
   2006. Very appreciated by the critics, these tires received attributes
   going from "very recommended" to "highly recommended". Founded in
   Milan, at the end of the 19th century Pirelli has definitely won its
   place among the greatest tire manufacturers in the world. Design and
   high technology: the Italians imposed their marks on the field with
   their perception of the tire mixing both the technical perfection and
   the most "design" aesthetics. In 2004, Pirelli "showed off" with
   Subaru, in the World Rally Championship. More recently they have become
   associates with Ford, who chose Pirelli as a strategic partner in 2006.

     * Cinturato P4 test
     * Note this tyre

   The Italian manufacturer Pirelli was declared favourite by renowned
   automobile magazines after the summer tires tests, held in Germany, in
   2006. Very appreciated by the critics, these tires received attributes
   going from "very recommended" to "highly recommended". Founded in
   Milan, at the end of the 19th century Pirelli has definitely won its
   place among the greatest tire manufacturers in the world. Design and
   high technology: the Italians imposed their marks on the field with
   their perception of the tire mixing both the technical perfection and
   the most "design" aesthetics. In 2004, Pirelli "showed off" with
   Subaru, in the World Rally Championship. More recently they have become
   associates with Ford, who chose Pirelli as a strategic partner in 2006.

     * Cinturato P6 test
     * Note this tyre

   The Italian manufacturer Pirelli was declared favourite by renowned
   automobile magazines after the summer tires tests, held in Germany, in
   2006. Very appreciated by the critics, these tires received attributes
   going from "very recommended" to "highly recommended". Founded in
   Milan, at the end of the 19th century Pirelli has definitely won its
   place among the greatest tire manufacturers in the world. Design and
   high technology: the Italians imposed their marks on the field with
   their perception of the tire mixing both the technical perfection and
   the most "design" aesthetics. In 2004, Pirelli "showed off" with
   Subaru, in the World Rally Championship. More recently they have become
   associates with Ford, who chose Pirelli as a strategic partner in 2006.

       Excellent blend of grip and feeling, the feedback really puts you
       in control and are stable and accurate in corners. become even more
       secure and predictable in the wet, no worries at all.
