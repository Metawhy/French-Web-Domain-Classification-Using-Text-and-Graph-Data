Dota Plus Autumn Update

   September 26, 2019 - Dota Team

   Today’s patch brings a few features to Dota Plus in the wake of the
   Battle Pass season, as well as the addition of all-new item sets for
   Lion, Slardar, and Crystal Maiden to the Dota Plus Rewards section.

   Plus subscribers can now use the Avoid Player feature to exclude
   unwanted players from their matchmaking pool, get precise stacking info
   with the Creep Pull Timers, ward more effectively with the Ward
   Suggestions, and see your total incoming damage breakdown by type.

   This update also replaces the old machine learning hero suggestions
   with the Friends and Foes feature from the Battle Pass, transfers some
   new Chat Wheel Sounds into your Dota Plus reward options, and adds the
   ability to customize your Chat Wheel phrases with emoticons.

   To top it off, we’ve also introduced the Season 4 Matchmaking Quests
   and some new hero quests to add some more ways to bump up the number of
   shards in your stash, and players who queue into the Hard Support role
   in Ranked Matchmaking can even earn bonus shards.

   Lastly, this year’s Trove Carafe will only be available for two more
   weeks, so players still interested in purchasing should make sure to
   snag some treasure before it’s gone.

Matchmaking Update for the Next Ranked Season

   September 17, 2019 - Dota Team

   The new Ranked season is here. Today’s blog will go over the changes we
   are doing as well as areas we are still thinking about. The changes in
   this update will be rolled out gradually over the next two days as we
   iron out bugs. The calibration part of the new season will begin this
   Thursday.

   Role Symmetry
   ====

   One big observation that we had since the previous update was that
   matches with misaligned roles had a meaningful impact on game quality.
   An example of this is when the mid player for one team has the highest
   rank on their team, and the mid player on the other team has the lowest
   rank. This tended to cause games to be really volatile and not
   enjoyable. In the past we used to prioritize rank spread between the
   two teams as one of the main criteria for the matchmaker to judge
   success, however as part of this update we are changing its priorities.
   It will now put a big emphasis on making sure that the roles are more
   symmetric rather than other criteria. This will also be something we
   will continue to tweak and iterate on over the coming weeks to make
   sure the algorithm’s search structure is correctly tuned and optimized
   for this.

   Draft Role Report
   ====

   To help ensure everyone plays the role they queued for, this update
   includes a role report function during the drafting and beginning
   minutes of the game. Starting with today’s update, using this
   information along with some other detection mechanisms, we will be much
   more aggressive in punishing players who abuse the system.

   Core and Support Ranks
   ====

   Some baseline dota skills and knowledge are shared between the Support
   and Core roles. So having the two numbers be entirely separated didn’t
   seem like a good idea to us, as we’d be losing valuable information
   about the player as well as promoting some warped incentives when you
   play your least used roles. As such, when you win or lose a game queued
   as one type of role, we’ll also update the MMR of the other type by a
   percentage of that game’s gains or losses. We’ll be tweaking that ratio
   over time as we figure out the best balance.

   Ban Waves
   ====

   This update includes a few different ban waves for bad actors. The
   first ban wave is to players with exceptionally low behavior scores. We
   will continue to do regular ban waves for users who fall into this
   small percentage of the community. Users that reach this low level of
   behavior in the game are too big of a tax on the rest of the community
   and are not wanted. The second case where users will be banned today is
   for anyone detected of violating the Steam Service Agreement that
   prevents the purchase or sale of Steam accounts. Buying accounts to get
   a higher or lower rank is not allowed and causes negative side effects
   for the play experience of others. This doesn’t catch all account sales
   that happen, but we think we have caught enough to take some action. We
   are also banning players who’ve been detected using exploits to gain an
   advantage over other players. In the coming weeks, we will be refining
   the detection algorithms for these abusive behaviors and will begin
   issuing weekly bans that will go into effect without advance notice to
   violating accounts. Accounts that we ban will now also have the
   associated phone number permanently blacklisted from being able to have
   access to ranked matchmaking.

   Smurfs
   ====

   We recognize that recently there has been an increase in smurf
   accounts. We share the sentiments the community has expressed on this
   issue and we consider it a high priority for us to solve as well. There
   isn’t a single solution that can address this issue easily, but we hope
   that a combination of multiple different changes over time will reduce
   the negative impacts and frequency of it.

   The first change in this area is the usage of phone number
   verification. We’ve found a loophole that allowed a large number of
   users to play ranked without a unique phone number attached. We have
   fixed this bug and any user that does not have their account set up
   correctly will be prevented from queuing until it is resolved. This
   will also affect accounts that have been actively playing in ranked
   matchmaking, rather than just new accounts going forward.

   We are also changing the mechanism to grant Ranked access. Rather than
   a fixed number of games, we are changing the metric to be a time based
   one and increased that amount to 100 hours of playtime. Any users that
   already have access to ranked without meeting this requirement will be
   removed from ranked until they’ve played enough time.

   Our general approach to Smurfs is to try to get accounts that are
   performing higher than expected to their correct rank faster. The first
   change on this axis is to adjust MMR by more than just +/- 25 when we
   detect that a user has been clearly over performing (based on how the
   played heroes usually perform at a given rank). This will be an ongoing
   process as we get better at detecting this, but from the data analysis
   we’ve done so far, we think we can make some progress using this. This
   change will be silent for a few days as we verify the detection
   mechanism is working as intended, and will be enabled once that is
   verified. The other change we are making is how we calibrate the
   initial ranked MMR for new accounts entering ranked. Leveraging the new
   hours played gate we are adding for ranked access, we will be using
   your account’s historical performance more aggressively to place you
   into a more accurate initial rank. In the past we introduced a really
   low cap on initial rank, we think that was a mistake on our part,
   because it caused smurfs to unnecessarily impact a large volume of
   games before arriving at a closer-to-accurate rank.

   Moving forward, we will be spending more time on live detection of
   smurfing and boosting behaviors. This will hopefully allow us to put
   detected accounts into an aggressive recalibration, resulting in a much
   quicker adjustment to an accurate MMR while reducing the number of
   games that are ruined in the process. In addition to this aggressive
   recalibration, we’ll also be detecting and banning accounts for
   egregious boosting or exploiting of game mechanics.

   Miscellaneous Changes
   ====

   To help reduce role confusion when queuing as a party, we’ve added a
   detailed popup for times when your party’s selected roles are
   incompatible, such as when two players have only selected the same
   role.

   While this update is banning extremely low behavior score players,
   we’ve also increased the number of commends available for each player
   so you can recognize good behavior in your games as well.

   Other Thoughts
   ====

   There are a few other general changes that we are not sure are needed
   yet or haven’t been able to address yet, but are on our radar. We
   thought it might be a good idea to supplement this blog with
   information in the hope that community conversation about it can be
   helpful.

   – High MMR games: While we have some changes here that directly and
   indirectly improve matchmaking quality for the extremely high end
   bracket, we will be closely monitoring this to see if other changes are
   needed.

   – Hard Support: For certain MMR brackets, queue times and game quality
   would be meaningfully improved if there were a bigger percentage of
   players queuing for Hard Support. Many of the subpar matches we’ve
   found were a result of there not being enough players queuing for this
   role. We are exploring to see if any solutions can be effective for
   incentivising this. We also know that it is more common that you’ll get
   Hard Support if you queue for all the roles, and we’d like that to
   eventually not be the case.

   – Role queue abuse: As mentioned above, we’ll be much more aggressive
   in punishing players who don’t play the role they’ve queued for. If we
   find that role abuse persists despite these efforts, we’ll consider
   implementing role-specific bans that prevent a user from queuing for
   the abused role in future matchmaking games after they’ve left low
   priority. Our hope is that implementing such measures will be
   unnecessary as the results of our other changes.

   – Smurfs: Dota 2 being a free-to-play game introduces various
   matchmaking related challenges. One option we have thought about is
   having Ranked access have a one time entry cost, and that access can be
   lost for players who regularly ruin games. We may also grandfather in
   users that we have enough data on, but we haven’t gone too deep in
   assessing the details here. We aren’t sure if we need this as a
   solution yet either, we hope that other solutions can have a good
   effect at improving the matchmaking ecosystem.

   In terms of our development focus moving forward, we are spending more
   of our time than usual focusing on matchmaking quality. We believe that
   is the right call given how much opportunity there is to make the
   day-to-day experience better for all players. We look forward to seeing
   your feedback on this update, and to continue to hear feedback in the
   following weeks for how to improve matchmaking.

The International Grand Champions

   August 30, 2019 - Dota Team

   Road to the Aegis
   Congratulations to OG, Grand Champions at The International 2019.

   OG rebuffed every challenger and silenced all critics as the first
   reigning champions in the history of The International to successfully
   defend their hold on the Aegis of Champions.

   After a dominating Group Stage that saw them drop only two games to
   their fourteen wins, OG squared off against a Newbee squad that was
   eager to prove themselves on the Main Stage. Newbee eked out a small
   advantage in the early goings of game one before OG took over and
   snowballed to victory. The defending champs never trailed in game two,
   and Newbee failed to kill ana’s Juggernaut even a single time.

   Next up would be the stalwart Evil Geniuses, who smashed through OG’s
   defenses for a convincing victory in game one that saw EG’s top cores
   at their best. In game two, the teams traded blows for thirty minutes
   before OG took over and never looked back–taking the win to push the
   series to a decisive game three in which OG’s ana killed every EG
   player at least once en route to victory.

   Last year’s runners-up PSG.LGD were the next challengers subjected to
   OG’s dominating run. Though the elite Chinese squad were able to secure
   a game-one victory, game two was a one-sided stomp in which ana was
   again unkillable–this time on the tournament powerhouse Alchemist. Game
   three was a tough fight with huge net worth swings. PSG.LGD scored more
   kills than the OG lineup, but the end result went the way of the
   resilient champions, sending OG into the Grand Finals for a second
   consecutive year to await their next opponent.

   While PSG.LGD did their best to set up a rematch by taking game one of
   the Lower Bracket Finals, Team Liquid proved the worthiest opponent,
   cracking off two straight victories to secure the right to face OG in
   the Grand Finals.

   As had happened in the previous two rounds, OG dropped the first game
   to their adversaries, unable to overcome Liquid’s assault despite
   leveling out a 20K net worth deficit before their Ancient fell.

   But from there, it was all OG. Their clever drafting and stellar play
   led the way to three straight victories over Team Liquid. OG sent the
   challengers packing and claimed the Aegis of Champions–the first
   players to ever raise it twice.

   As bearers of the ultimate symbol of victory, these names shall forever
   be inscribed–again–upon the Aegis of Champions:

                                    2019
                           Anathan “ana” Pham
                      Topias “Topson” Taavitsainen
                          Sébastien “Ceb” Debs
                         Jesse “JerAx” Vainikka
                        Johan “N0tail” Sundstein

   Looking Back
   If you missed any of the tournament, or just want to relive the
   incredible moments and plays, head over to the Dota 2 YouTube channel,
   where you can find replays of the tournament, including broadcast
   content from in between the games. You can also find a stash of photos
   from the event over on our Instagram and the Dota 2 Flickr.

   We would like to thank all of the players, talent, and everyone in the
   Dota community for helping bring this celebration to life. The
   International is the crowning moment of the competitive season, and
   without everyone’s support, none of this would be possible. We hope you
   enjoyed this year’s tournament as much as we did.

   The Days Ahead
   In the wake of The International, our next focus will be on preparing
   for the new Ranked Season as well as releasing some small gameplay
   balance tweaks. With the recent changes to Ranked Matchmaking, we’re
   interested to hear any feedback or suggestions you have. As always,
   it’s helpful to include account info and match IDs with your feedback
   in the contact form.

   Our next major release will be arriving later this fall with The
   Outlanders update, featuring the two new heroes–Snapfire and Void
   Spirit–that we announced at the event, as well as the next gameplay
   patch.

Trove Carafe Immortals

   August 19, 2019 - Dota Team

   The Trove Carafe for The International 2019 is now available, featuring
   all-new items for Bounty Hunter, Crystal Maiden, Nature’s Prophet, Arc
   Warden, Templar Assassin, Chaos Knight, and Tusk. In addition, each
   treasure you open offers the chance to receive a rare item set for
   Techies, very rare golden versions of the Tusk or Crystal Maiden items,
   or an ultra rare set for Monkey King.

   The Trove Carafe also lets you support your favorite broadcast talent
   at this year’s event by purchasing autographed versions of the
   treasure. Select the desired talent from the dropdown menu when
   purchasing to inscribe their autograph onto the item that you unbox.

   Attendee Item Drops

   Fans watching the tournament live at Mercedes-Benz Arena in Shanghai
   will once again have the chance to receive special item drops during
   the Main Event. At First Blood in each individual game, a limited
   number of exclusive Attendee Treasures will drop, each containing
   visually-unique versions of items selected from this year’s Immortals.
   To be eligible, make sure to register your daily code once you arrive
   at the arena.

   The International Main Event

   After four days of grueling battle, The International 2019 Group Stage
   is complete. Already we must say goodbye to the first two teams
   eliminated–Chaos Esports and Ninjas in Pyjamas.

   Defending champions OG are headed to the Upper Bracket after a
   dominating performance. They’ll be joined there by PSG.LGD, Team
   Secret, Vici Gaming, Evil Geniuses, TNC Predator, Newbee, and
   Virtus.pro.

   Alliance, Mineski, Infamous Gaming, Fnatic, Natus Vincere, Team Liquid,
   Royal Never Give Up, and Keen Gaming all face the threat of immediate
   elimination as they head into their first-round best-of-one games in
   the Lower Bracket on Tuesday, August 20 at Mercedes-Benz Arena.

   The opening broadcast begins at 10:00am China Standard Time. Head over
   to The International website for more info on the tournament standings,
   schedule, and more.

Tiny Prestige Item and Custom Creeps

   August 13, 2019 - Dota Team

   Today’s update rolls out the exclusive ‘Majesty of the Colossus’
   prestige item set for Tiny at Battle Level 255—along with the
   ‘Reptilian Refuge’ custom Radiant and Dire creeps at level 182—to fill
   out the Battle Pass rewards line as we approach The International.

   Featuring completely new models for each of his Grow states, plus
   custom animations and effects for Avalanche and Tree Grab, the ‘Majesty
   of the Colossus’ can only be earned by increasing your Battle Level to
   255 before the conclusion of The International 2019 Battle Pass.
   Players who’ve already grown to level 255 can claim this item set from
   the rewards line and roll into the lanes in splendor and style.

   To accommodate the release of this new item set, Tiny’s item slots have
   also been updated and simplified to correspond to his four levels of
   Grow, and his materials have been optimized to allow for more robust
   content creation. This means he will soon become available on the
   workshop, and that artists will only need to focus on making items to
   fit four base slots and one weapon slot on any future Tiny designs.

   The International Group Stage

   The first Group Stage action of The International kicks off at 9:00 am
   on Thursday, August 15 in Shanghai. With seeding in the Main Event at
   stake right from the start, make sure to tune in to the main stream to
   see the first stage of the tournament unfold.

Summer Scrub Part 2

   August 8, 2019 - Dota Team

   Today’s update delivers the second half of the Summer Scrub, focused on
   bug fixes and some quality of life improvements just in time for The
   International.

   One of the first changes you’re likely to notice is the implementation
   of a new version of the customizable hero grid. Players can now create
   multiple grid presets, each with their own unique layouts and
   categories. You can drag and drop heroes around the grid and rename or
   resize different buckets to suit your needs for any situation.

   We’ve also added a new alternate layout for the in-game item shop that
   allows you to toggle the classic column view to a new grid-style layout
   that retains the Basic and Upgrade sections while adding multiple
   grouped sub-categories for ease of use.

   On the game side, we decided to do a little house cleaning related to
   players exploiting matchmaking, botting or transferring accounts,
   resulting in a fresh ban wave for cheaters today. We’ve also made
   multiple performance improvements focused on minimizing hitches during
   teamfights.

   There’s also a whole host of bug fixes that you can read about over on
   the update page here. Thanks to everyone in the Dota community who
   helped us identify which things were most in need of a good scrub.
