   On a cold day in late 2016, two men sat in a corner at Nargis Café, an
   Uzbek and Russian restaurant in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. The place was
   decorated with tchotchkes from the steppes and ceramic depictions of
   peasant life: grandmas in babushkas, farmers with sheep. On a tiled

Shopping: Stripes & Checks and Tall Leather Boots

   If you’re as crazy for fall outfits as we are, you’ll love that plaids
   and checks are back again, and this time, we’re pairing the trend, in
   the form of a wool midi skirt, with a Georgia striped high-neck
   alpaca-blend sweater. Other items on our list include Byredo’s
   Bibliothèque, newly available as an eau de parfum, an intoxicating
   scent of fruity peach and plum top notes, floral violet and peony
   accords, and an earthy base of patchouli, leather and vanilla that
   lingers on the skin and is perfect for autumn. There are also some
   beautiful new pieces of jewellery from The Shop―scroll down for our

   retrofitting their singular, decades-past dance-noir for big-budget rap
   and pop.

   Style Inspiration: Happy October & Autumn Layers

Silk and Slips & October Whites

   EARLY OCTOBER and no one seems to be able to let go of whites just yet,
   pairing creamy silk slip skirts with cosy ecru turtlenecks or balloon
   sleeve maxi dresses with tall leather boots. Whether boiler suits or
   blazers, pleated dresses or cropped denim, autumn comes in shades of
   white…

   Of course I have a lot of memories of my father. It’s only natural,
   considering that we lived under the same roof of our not exactly
   spacious home from the time I was born until I left home at eighteen.

Style Inspiration: Autumn Wicker

   Some might think that wicker is a summer thing, but the wicker items in
   The Shop have continued to be popular long after summer’s end. If
   you’re wondering how to take your wicker bag from summer to fall, a
   pair of blue jeans and a blazer are all it takes…

   Style Inspiration | Logo Mania: The Return of Fendi & Karl Lagerfeld’s
   Last Work

   @styleappetite

This is a time of fashion houses reissuing their iconic pieces, and with
Fendi's reissuing of its Baguette on the SS19 runways and Karl Lagerfeld's
recent passing away, the Italian fashion house is very much on everyone's
minds. The late designer did, after all, work for the brand for 54 years. So
for this edition of Style Inspiration, we'll look at the many iterations of
Fendi's iconic FℲ branded pieces, from mock turtlenecks and knits to capes,
tights, and trenches, and of course, the Baguette.

"Lagerfeld spent an astonishing, world-record-breaking 54 years at Italian
house Fendi, producing more than 100 collections for it." (The Guardian)

KARL LAGERFELD'S FINAL SHOW

As soon as guests entered the venue, the Italian house's tribute to the
late Karl Lagerfeld and his 54-year-long tenure as creative director was
immediately felt: Above the catwalk's entrance was his handwritten signature
in lights; at every seat was a touching tribute card that commemorates his
death; and show notes came with sketches of Lagerfeld's final collection for
Fendi.

After, the room went dark and a video featured a not-too-long-ago Lagerfeld
sketching his first-ever design all the way from 1965, showing that at Fendi,
his memory will always live on. (Fashionista)

“I want the bow.” That instruction came to Silvia Venturini Fendi from Karl
Lagerfeld on Monday, the day before his death. Backstage after showing her
and Lagerfeld’s beautiful Fendi collection, the last of their long-term
collaboration, Venturini Fendi was emotional as she greeted well-wishers; she
had known Lagerfeld up-close for most of her life. He started working with
her mother and aunts at Fendi in 1965, a record for collaborative longevity
and excellence that will never be approached. Her comments confirmed that
which many who knew Karl had long assumed: If he couldn’t live forever, he
would go engaged in the most important thing in the world to him―work.

Lagerfeld was fully engaged until the end and planned to attend the show. “He
was supposed to come. We organized everything for him to be here,” Venturini
Fendi said. “This collection made him live longer. Because we had been
working a lot.”

It showed. Over the years Lagerfeld took Fendi in numerous directions, most
recently, one that infused high polish with a sporty attitude. He achieved
this mood via intricate cuts, layerings and working with remarkable
materials, the fruits of Fendi’s incredible R&D. He would bring it all
together ingeniously, the complications of construction belied by an inviting
visual ease. That was the case here, in a collection that radiated relaxed
authority.

The Fendi Baguette is Back

The Return of the Fendi Baguette

As evident from Spring/Summer 2019 runways, the Fendi Baguette is officially
back. The slender, unstructured, logo-clasped design was first dreamed up by
Silvia Venturini Fendi in 1996, at a time when larger bags such as Prada's
black nylon backpack were leading the market. Named after the French bread,
the design was not met with much enthusiasm at Fendi, but the designer went
with her instincts and and the first Baguette was released  on runways in
1997. It would become wildly successful and the first "It" bag. The Baguette
would be featured on Sex and the City several times, sealing its fate as a
fashion icon. In fact, "Fendi was the first luxury house to take a chance and
lend pieces to stylist Patricia Field for the first season of the show in
1998, and she repaid their faith in her by making the bag one of its stars."

Interior Design: A Scandinavian Home by Hanna Wessman

   Tuesday 19th May, 2015

   by This Is Glamorous

   Hanna-Wessman1

   SOMETHING A LITTLE AGAINST type by way of interiors today —
   Scandinavian, modern, blue — and yet there is still a maximalist
   quality to the work of Hanna Wessman, who decorated this home for a
   friend. Perhaps it is the bits of gold or the white roses, or that it
   could nearly be described as ornate austerity . . .
