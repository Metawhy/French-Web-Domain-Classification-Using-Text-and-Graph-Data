       This mouse has changable grips yet both are far too small!
       The whole mouse needs to be 25% bigger. how about some usefull
       grips rather than just pictures please. Due to the small size I
       find is causes poor accuracy and wrist strain.
       This is ment to be a gaming mouse. Most people I know have the same
       size hand as me‚Ä¶.

        Erik Charlton May 22, 2009 at 14:32
            Hi Graeme,
            Thanks for the feedback. I realize that some G9 customers out
            there would prefer a larger grip. We have created a larger
            grip, the ID grip, which today is only available for sale in
            the U.S. on Logitech.com. We are trying to expedite plans to
            release this grip for sale in other parts of the world, but as
            of today, it is not yet available. Also, we do have two widely
            available mice, the G5 and MX518, that offer the larger shape
            for those who prefer a big mouse. The G9 was seeking to appeal
            to a range of gamers, including those who prefer a smaller
            mouse.
            Gamers prefer a lot of different types of mouse shapes for
            gaming, which is why you see so many different shapes out in
            the market. Unfortunately, no one size fits all.

       I was considering buying one of these to replace my first
       generation Logitech G5 (single side button), as the the tilt-wheel
       eventually became unresponsive when using side-scroll (Button 5 and
       6). However, the size and shape concerns me, as I also need it for
       graphic design and editing and high-end gaming so prolonged usage
       has to come into the picture.
       My inquiry, I always hear the ID grip is bigger then the wide-grip
       packaged with the G9/G9x, but cannot find a single comparison shot
       (say to G5/the old grip, etc.) to get an idea of how much bigger.
       How much taller is the palm, how much wider, and what‚Äôs the
       material like (is it a very-hard rubberized material like the G5/G7
       or softer), etc.?
       Honestly, other then finding out it‚Äôs vaguely bigger in a customer
       review then the wide-grip, there is a lack of information
       considering it‚Äôs such an expensive mouse combination (we are
       talking roughly $130 before S&H and tax). So it‚Äôs essentially
       competing price wise with the Razer Mamba for the most expensive
       gamer mouse.
       I think everyone just wants to see the look or shape of an MX
       Revolution / MX1100 / G5 with the power of the G9/G9X under the
       hood. We haven‚Äôt really seen a new gamer mouse with that shape,
       incredible look, or size from Logitech in awhile. So coming out
       with a new shell or grip for the mouse that fits that bill would
       probably make a bunch of people happy.
       (Not to mention when this grip was announced some articles and
       video reviews kept mentioning you could custom tailor the surface
       texture, color, shape, size, and picture and it ended up only being
       the picture was somewhat of a letdown).

            Hi Jason,
            Thanks for the feedback ‚Äî we are currently working on
            providing improved content on our Web site to include
            information about our mouse shapes and size. On the ID grip
            product pages on Logitech.com, you\‚Äôll find the following
            information.
            Technical Specifications:
            Dimensions
            ‚Äì Length: 11.5 cm
            ‚Äì Width: 8.5 cm
            ‚Äì Height: 3.5 cm
            ‚Äì Weight (Grip only): 45 g
            ‚Äì Weight (Grip plus G9 mouse, no cord): 133 g
            Materials
            ‚Äì Plastic grip with soft-touch coating
            ‚Äì Ink-infused plastic panel
            The ID grip does not have the same DryGrip coating that is
            found on the sides of the G5 Laser Mouse. Instead, it is a
            soft-touch coating more similar to that used on the MX518.
            Here are some informal photos showing how the ID grip compares
            to the G5 (as well as the existing Wide Load/XL grip shipping
            with current G9x), so hopefully this helps give you more
            perspective on how the grip stacks up.
            Those who prefer the larger, more palming-style shape of the
            G5 and MX518 usually find the ID grip for the G9 to be more
            suitable. While we do\‚Äônt have anything to announce, we are
            aware that the G5 could use a little update. üôÇ
            Ciao, Erik

   Jason Pillock June 3, 2009 at 19:51
       Thanks Erik,
       The comparison photos helped and it‚Äôs definitely closing in on the
       size and shape of it‚Äôs bigger brothers, which is just enough from
       me to give it a test drive now. I have one suggestion based on that
       photo of the bottom and with the grips growing in size. You might
       want to consider adding more small Polytetrafluoroethylene feet to
       right-side and back-end of the grip. It feels like the grips might
       otherwise drag a bit if enough pressure is applied in a given way,
       is off-balance slightly, or hangs on a side more then another.
       My only remaining concern, something I found out when continuing to
       research the mouse is an issue with the prepackaged G9 (not sure
       about the G9x) grips (sounds more like the wide-grip) will easily
       begin flaking and peeling when rubbed against the skin. Is the new
       ID Grip suffering the same issue or will I need to regularly call
       Logitech for replacements?
       (I could probably fix that problem myself by either striping the
       material down and replacing it with something better or soaking it
       in a solution to coat it.)
       In any case, I look forward to more G9 grips and any new G-Series
       mice that manage to make their way to retail. Maybe, even use this
       grip idea for the next G-Series mice as well, with more chooses in
       grip shapes, textures, color, etc.

        Erik Charlton June 6, 2009 at 11:01
            Hi Jason,
            The initial G9 units had an issue with paint flaking or
            peeling on some of the Wide Load/XL grips. We have since
            improved the specifications and changed vendors for improved
            durability, and the ID grip does have this improved coating.
            If someone has an issue with an early unit though, they can
            contact customer support for a replacement grip.

       I know you are trying to make this avaliable in the rest of the
       world. But might I suggest making the pre-built grips avaliable
       first‚Ä¶
       I know it will take a long time to make the custom picture service
       avaliable since it requires web site translation, local processing
       facilities etc. But for those of us who do not want their own
       pictures, how about shipping say 10 of your most popular pre made
       picture grips (flurry, etc) to resellers in a few countries outside
       the US. I don‚Äôt think that would take to long to set-up and would
       keep most people happy.

   Mat June 18, 2009 at 02:06
       How about even the option of international dispatch from your US
       website to at least give people the option until things are setup
       elsewhere.

       there, the G9x is not there and ofcourse the ID GRIPS are NOT
       THERE. i cant buy from logitech US because my credit card is issued

       THANK YOU
       p.s: i‚Äôve been looking for a solution for this for the past 4

       Hi
       How about making these available, and possibly in a wider variety
       of shapes, without a picture at all and at an appropriately reduced
       price. I couldn‚Äôt care less about a picture that will be covered by
       my hand while my eyes are looking at the screen, often in a dark
       room.
       Why not a $10 non-picture equivalent. You‚Äôd be sure to sell them
       quickly.
       For the most part I like this mouse and it‚Äôs really improved my
       game but, I‚Äôm about to give up on it because my claw style grip is
       uncomfortable if not causing injury. I bought this mouse largely on
       the ‚Äúunrealized‚Äù promise of finding just the right grip to fit my
       style but this mouse has features that other mice don‚Äôt and that
       I‚Äôve come to find indispensable. Suggesting a person ‚Äúbuy‚Äù a lesser
       mouse when this mouse is capable of being adapted is not what I
       would call helpful. You‚Äôre missing a golden opportunity by not
       taking full advantage of the potential interchangeable grips
       offers. Pictures on 1 new grip style is the best you can do?

       I‚Äôm a long time user of this mouse and i absolutely love it.
       Anyway, in my AUTOCAD class we decided to make a 3d drawing of any
       object, i decided on the logitech g9 mouse. I‚Äôd appreciate it if
       anyone could supply some extra dimensions like arc length and what
       not.

V220 Mouse Now Offered in a Variety of Colors and Patterns

   Posted on June 9, 2009 by Delphine Donne-Crock in News and
   Announcements, PC Peripherals with 2 Comments on V220 Mouse Now Offered
   in a Variety of Colors and Patterns

   As senior global product marketing manager for notebook mice, I‚Äôve had
   the pleasure of helping to drive a number of innovations since joining
   Logitech three years ago.

   When I joined Logitech, I thought that our mouse lineup was great, but
   I noticed that they were mainly black or silver in color. These colors
   seemed, in general, to be aimed more at men than at women, so I set
   about adding colors to the line-up. Working with the Logitech
   notebook-mouse team, we launched a range of colors of our V220 mouse
   last year.

   A year later, I am very excited to launch the new V220 collection,
   which offers a full range of new and refreshing patterns for the V220
   cordless mouse for notebooks. If you‚Äôre like me, you enjoy adding a
   touch of your personality to the things you use every day, whether it
   be a special keychain, a fashionable clothing accessory, or a cell
   phone in your signature color. My goal with this collection is to help
   you celebrate your style when it comes to your laptop accessories.

   The new V220 mouse patterns and colors will be available beginning
   today in the U.S for a suggested retail price of $29.99.
