The 20th International Conference on Computational Science and its
Applications

   The 20th International Conference on Computational Science and
   Applications (ICCSA 2020) will be held on July 1 - 4, 2020 in Cagliari,
   Italy in collaboration with the University of Cagliari, Italy.

   Cagliari is the largest city of Sardinia Island. In its neighborhood
   are located several extraordinary beautiful beaches!

   ICCSA 2020 has been the next event in a series of highly successful
   International Conferences on Computational Science and Its Applications
   (ICCSA), previously held in Saint Petersburg, Russia (2019), Melbourne,
   Australia (2018), Trieste, Italy (2017), Beijing. China (2016), Banff,
   Canada (2015), Guimaraes, Portugal (2014), Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
   (2013), Salvador de Bahia, Brazil (2012), Santander, Spain (2011),
   Fukuoka, Japan (2010), Suwon, Korea (2009), Perugia, Italy (2008),
   Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (2007), Glasgow, UK (2006), Singapore (2005),
   Assisi, Italy (2004), Montreal, Canada (2003), and (as ICCS) in
   Amsterdam, The Netherlands  (2002) and San Francisco, USA (2001). The
   first ICCSA conference was co-organized by C.J.K. Tan (UK) and M.
   Gavrilova (U of Calgary, Canada) in 2003.

   Computational Science is a main pillar of most of the present research,
   industrial and commercial activities and plays a unique role in
   exploiting Information and Communication Technologies as innovative
   technologies.

   The ICCSA Conference offers a real opportunity to discuss new issues,
   tackle complex problems and find advanced enabling solutions able to
   shape new trends in Computational Science.

   Submitted papers will be subject to stringent peer review by at least
   three experts and carefully evaluated based on originality,
   significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition.

   All accepted papers will be included in the Springer Lecture Notes in
   Computer Science (LNCS) series and indexed by Scopus, EI Engineering
   Index, Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index (included
   in ISI Web of Science), and several other indexing services. The papers
   will contain linked references, XML versions and citable DOI numbers.

   Springer is able to manage ORCID ID related to the authors and the
   Proceedings Volumes Editors! Please add the ORCID ID related to each
   author of your submitted paper!!!

   Warning: Fake ICCSA Conference by WASET
   We have noticed the existence of organisations such as WASET that run
   fake “conferences” in order to make profit with the registration fees,
   often spoofing the names of real conferences. WASET claims to be
   organising a conference called ICCSA next year, which is a FAKE ICCSA
   conference.
   The Real ICCSA conference has been organised by the ICCSA Society since
   2003. We do not have any involvement with WASET. Please spread this
   news to your contacts and communities so that nobody mistakenly
   participates to such fake conferences.
   WASET is predator publisher. Go to this Wiki
