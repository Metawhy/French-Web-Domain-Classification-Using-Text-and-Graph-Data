   The Spheres Opening Day
     __________________________________________________________________

The Spheres are a place where employees can think and work differently
surrounded by plants.

   The Spheres are a result of innovative thinking about the character of
   a workplace and an extended conversation about what is typically
   missing from urban offices– a direct link to nature. The Spheres are
   home to more than 40,000 plants from the cloud forest regions of over
   30 countries.
