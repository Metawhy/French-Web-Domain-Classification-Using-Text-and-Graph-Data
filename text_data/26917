   About this book
          Semidefinite and conic optimization is a major and thriving
          research area within the optimization community. Although
          semidefinite optimization has been studied (under different
          names) since at least the 1940s, its importance grew immensely
          during the 1990s after polynomial-time interior-point methods
          for linear optimization were extended to solve semidefinite
          optimization problems.

          Since the beginning of the 21st century, not only has research
          into semidefinite and conic optimization continued unabated, but
          also a fruitful interaction has developed with algebraic
          geometry through the close connections between semidefinite
          matrices and polynomial optimization. This has brought about
          important new results and led to an even higher level of
          research activity.

          This Handbook on Semidefinite, Conic and Polynomial Optimization
          provides the reader with a snapshot of the state-of-the-art in
          the growing and mutually enriching areas of semidefinite
          optimization, conic optimization, and polynomial optimization.
          It contains a compendium of the recent research activity that
          has taken place in these thrilling areas, and will appeal to
          doctoral students, young graduates, and experienced researchers
          alike.

          The Handbook’s thirty-one chapters are organized into four
          parts:

          + Theory, covering significant theoretical developments as well
            as the interactions between conic optimization and polynomial
            optimization;
          + Algorithms, documenting the directions of current algorithmic
            development;
          + Software, providing an overview of the state-of-the-art;
          + Applications, dealing with the application areas where
            semidefinite and conic optimization has made a significant
            impact in recent years.

   Reviews
          From the reviews:

          “This volume is a collection of self contained survey papers on
          various aspects of semidefinite programming and polynomial
          optimization. The volume is divided into four sections, covering
          the theory of conic and polynomial optimization, algorithms,
          software implementations, and applications of semidefinite and
          polynomial optimization. … This is an advanced book and
          particularly in the theory section … . The papers in this volume
          will be of interest to advanced graduate students and
          researchers working in conic optimization, SDP, and polynomial
          optimization.” (Brian Borchers, The Mathematical Association of
          America, June, 2012)

   About this book
          Semidefinite and conic optimization is a major and thriving
          research area within the optimization community. Although
          semidefinite optimization has been studied (under different
          names) since at least the 1940s, its importance grew immensely
          during the 1990s after polynomial-time interior-point methods
          for linear optimization were extended to solve semidefinite
          optimization problems.

          Since the beginning of the 21st century, not only has research
          into semidefinite and conic optimization continued unabated, but
          also a fruitful interaction has developed with algebraic
          geometry through the close connections between semidefinite
          matrices and polynomial optimization. This has brought about
          important new results and led to an even higher level of
          research activity.

          This Handbook on Semidefinite, Conic and Polynomial Optimization
          provides the reader with a snapshot of the state-of-the-art in
          the growing and mutually enriching areas of semidefinite
          optimization, conic optimization, and polynomial optimization.
          It contains a compendium of the recent research activity that
          has taken place in these thrilling areas, and will appeal to
          doctoral students, young graduates, and experienced researchers
          alike.

          The Handbook’s thirty-one chapters are organized into four
          parts:

          + Theory, covering significant theoretical developments as well
            as the interactions between conic optimization and polynomial
            optimization;
          + Algorithms, documenting the directions of current algorithmic
            development;
          + Software, providing an overview of the state-of-the-art;
          + Applications, dealing with the application areas where
            semidefinite and conic optimization has made a significant
            impact in recent years.

   Reviews
          From the reviews:

          “This volume is a collection of self contained survey papers on
          various aspects of semidefinite programming and polynomial
          optimization. The volume is divided into four sections, covering
          the theory of conic and polynomial optimization, algorithms,
          software implementations, and applications of semidefinite and
          polynomial optimization. … This is an advanced book and
          particularly in the theory section … . The papers in this volume
          will be of interest to advanced graduate students and
          researchers working in conic optimization, SDP, and polynomial
          optimization.” (Brian Borchers, The Mathematical Association of
          America, June, 2012)
