   Open Y: Drupal Distribution for YMCA's

   This group had the goal of creating a digital platform that was
   cost-effective, yet provided the best possible customer experience. For
   YMCAs with smaller digital budgets or teams, this allows any
   association to have a top-tier website for little investment, and YMCAs
   with larger digital budgets were able to innovate and expand, thus,
   Drupal 8 built a better platform for everyone.

   State of Drupal Presentation

   Many Drupalists recently came together for DrupalCon Amsterdam.
   As a matter of tradition, I presented my State of Drupal keynote. I
   kicked off with an update on Drupal 8, then gave an update on Drupal 9,
   as we're just eight months from the target release date. I then thanked
   all of Drupal's contributors, and other volunteers.
