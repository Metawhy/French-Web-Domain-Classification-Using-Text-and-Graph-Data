   Gold Mini Pizza Boxes!  The PERFECT pairing to the Christmastime is
   Here Suite!

   The Gold Mini Pizza Boxes were a tad brighter than I wanted them to be,
   so I distressed it with a sanding block.  I absolutely LOVE the
   result!  It is almost a matte finish and it pairs well with the Gold
   Foil Sheets.

   I wrapped the outside of the Gold Mini Pizza Box with the gorgeous Gold
   1/4″ Shimmer Ribbon, securing it with Mini Glue Dots and a bow.

   The largest of the Rose Dies cuts out both the stamped image and the
   image from the Christmas Is Here Designer Series Paper.  The Stampin’
   Up! colors in the Christmastime is Here Suite are: Cherry Cobbler,
   Early Espresso, Mossy Meadow, Poppy Parade & Gold Foil!

   Many of the images from the Designer Series Paper are fussy cut
   friendly. I fussy cut several pieces for my five 3×3 cards shown
   below.

   Make sure you have some Gold Foil Sheets and Gold Stampin’ Emboss
   Powder on hand!  I used them for the sentiments and accent pieces on
   both the Gold Mini Pizza Box decor and the 3×3 cards.

   The Gold Glitter Enamel Dots were added to each piece as the final
   touch!

   Winter Woods and Buffalo Check Stamp Sets by Stampin' Up! Card by
   Stesha Bloodhart, Stampin' Hoot!

   Winter Woods! I absolutely LOVE this Stamp Set and coordinating dies!

   The Stamp Review Crew, a ground of stampers from around the globe that
   love Stampin’ Up! products,  is hopping and featuring the Winter Woods
   Cling Stamp Set!  This stamp set has a coordinating die set called Into
   the Woods.  Although the cards created below are not new, they are my
   most popular Pinterest Pins for a year’s running.  Since I ran out of
   time to create something new (story of my life these days it seems) I
   decided to re-share these creations in case you may have missed them
   the first go-round.
   Visit the Stamp Review Crew Blog!
   Winter Woods and Buffalo Check Stamp Sets by Stampin' Up! Card by
   Stesha Bloodhart, Stampin' Hoot!

   Good News!  The True Gentleman Buttons are back in the CLEARANCE RACK
   and marked down to $2.80!  What a steal!  I used them on both of my
   card creations as they pair so well with the Winter Woods and Buffalo
   Check Stamp Sets.
   [Step-By-Step-Instructions-Stampin-Hoot.jpg]
     * With a Stampin’ Trimmer, cut a piece of Crumb Cake Cardstock to 5
       1/2″ x 4 1/4″.
     * Cut a piece of Crumb Cake Cardstock to 5″ x 2 1/2″.  Stamp the
       Birch Trees in Tuxedo Black Memento Ink. Adhere with Stampin’
       Dimensionals.
     * Cut a piece of Cherry Cobbler Cardstock to 4 1/4″ x 5 1/2″.  Using
       the Stamparatus, stamp the Buffalo Check in Tuxedo Black Memento
       Ink as many times as needed for desired coverage.  Cut down to two
       1 1/2″ x 5 1/4″, using the check pattern as a guideline.
       Crinkle/distress the edges. Wrap 4 loops of Linen Thread around one
       of the pieces.  Adhere a True Gentleman Button (with Linen Thread)
       with a Mini Glue Dot.  Adhere as shown with Snail Adhesive and
       Stampin’ Dimensionals.
     * Crop the Merry with a Big Shot and Basic Black Cardstock.  Snip
       Mini Stampin’ Dimensionals to size and adhere to the card.
     * Use Tuxedo Black Memento Ink to stamp the pine tree, deer and
       sentiment onto Crumb Cake Cardstock.  Crop the pine tree and deer
       with the coordinating framelits and a Big Shot.  Snip the sentiment
       to size with a Paper Snips.  Adhere as shown with Stampin’
       Dimensionals.

   Do you struggle with masculine cards?  I hear that a lot, but masculine
   cards are some of my favorite to create…it may be because of the way I
   was brought up (horses, hunting, and more) so they come easier to me,
   not sure, but I truly hope I am inspiring others to help create more
   masculine creations.

   When CASEing (Copy and Share Everything) I decided to stick to the
   layout.  You can choose to CASE all or just part of the creation, just
   CASE the part that inspires you.  Colors, layout, theme, etc. I changed
   all items out with Wrapped in Plaid 6 x 6 Designer Series Paper, Gold
   Foil, and Gold Embossing.
