   The Fifth International Symposium on "Biology of Decision Making"
   (SBDM) will take place on May 11-13, 2015 in Paris, France. The first
   day of conference will take place at Ecole Normale Supérieure, 29 rue
   d'Ulm, 75005 Paris. The two next days will take place at the Institut

   ethology, psychiatry, neural and computational approaches) to decision
   making.
   The conference will include 6 sessions:
     * Beyond two: Multi-alternative and multi-attribute choices,
     * Shaky business: Neural sources of choice variability,
     * Looking for causality: Choice bias following brain manipulation,
