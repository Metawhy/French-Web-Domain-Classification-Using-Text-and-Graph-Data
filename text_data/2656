Giant pumice raft from underwater volcanic eruption makes its way to Great
Barrier Reef

   By Kate McKenna

   Drifting through the ocean, the sailors suddenly lost sight of water.

   Surrounding their boat was a floating mass of pumice rocks — the result
   of an underwater volcanic eruption near Tonga two weeks ago.

Key points:

     * An Australian couple detailed their experience with the "total rock
       rubble slick" on social media while sailing their catamaran to Fiji
     * Pieces of pumice from the pumice raft should start washing up along
       Australia's coastline in seven to 12 months' time
     * Pumice rafts pose a navigational hazard for boats in the area as
       they are very abrasive and can get lodged in rudder systems

   Queensland University of Technology geologist Associate Professor Scott
   Bryan said it "would have been a really eerie experience sailing into
   this sea of floating rock".

   "No longer seeing water and hearing the scratching of the pumice
   against the hull," he said.

   Known as a pumice raft, this so-called island of floating rock is
   gradually heading for Australian shores and is so expansive it can be
   tracked via satellite.

   Australian couple Michael Hoult and Larissa Brill detailed their
   experience in a Facebook post with the "total rock rubble slick" while
   sailing their catamaran to Fiji.

   "The waves were knocked back to almost calm and the boat was slowed to
   1kt," they wrote.

     "The rubble slick went as far as we could see in the moonlight and
     without spotlight — we made a turn to starboard and managed to sail
     clear of the rubble slick."

Marine life 'hitching a ride'

   Associate Professor Bryan said along the way an abundance of marine
   life would attach themselves to the pumice raft, "hitching a ride"
   across the Coral Sea.

   Australia

   "In this 150-odd square kilometres of pumice out there right now,
   there's probably billions to trillions of pieces of pumice all floating
   together and each piece of pumice is a vehicle for some marine
   organism," he said.

   He said pieces of pumice should start washing up along Australia's
   coastline in seven to 12 months.

   "When it gets here, [the pumice raft will be] covered in a whole range
   of organisms of algae and barnacles and corals and crabs and snails and
   worms," he said.

   "We're going to have millions of individual corals and lots of other
   organisms all coming in together with the potential of finding new
   homes along our coastline.

     "This is a way for healthy, young corals to be rapidly introduced to
     the Great Barrier Reef."

   Associate Professor Bryan has studied the phenomenon for two decades,
   and 15 years ago he published research about an earlier eruption
   involving the same volcano near Tonga.

   "I saw pumice along the beach and thought it must have come from some
   eruption, which led me to forensically work out where," he said.

Navigational hazard for boats

   Associate Professor Bryan said this sort of event was occurring every
   five years.

   "[The raft] is a natural mechanism for species to colonise, restock and
   grow in a new environment," he said.

   "It's just one way that nature can help promote regeneration."

   But he warned pumice rafts could also pose a navigational hazard for
   boats in the area.

     "Pumice is very abrasive, it can scrape paint off boats, get lodged
     in the rudder systems, and can certainly be a nuisance and problem
     for boats," Associate Professor Bryan said.

   "It's important for them to not necessarily sail through the pumice
   rafts."

   He said the sailors who encountered the latest pumice raft would
   provide him with samples of the pumice to assist his research.

Why the growing subscription economy spells big bucks for business

   RN
   By Ben Hays and Fiona Pepper for The Money

   Your road-trip playlist is synced, all the TV shows and movies you
   could possibly need for a family getaway are just a tap or click away,
   but how will you fit the whole gang in your three-door hatch?

   Simply tweak your subscription and the kids can now each bring a
   friend, or you can hit the sand dunes in a new four-wheel drive.

   This kind of convenience is already a reality in some parts of the
   world and could soon be en route to a driveway near you.

   The subscription economy. It's not exactly a new concept — most people
   with a smartphone would be making a recurring payment for at least one
   or a combination of newspapers, magazines, music-streaming,
   video-streaming, cloud storage, and of course, the phone itself.

Listen to the story

   The Money takes a look at subscriptions, and how they are changing the
   way we buy goods and services.

   Its success has made it a model business are increasingly adopting.
   From toothbrushes to vegetables, entertainment to cars: providing
   services and products by subscription is a great way for companies to
   get to know you and keep you close.

   And as the list of products grows, so too do the profits.

   America's subscription economy was estimated to be worth $420 billion
   in 2015.

   "The data shows the subscription economy is growing faster, year over
   year," says Iman Ghodosi, general manager of Asia-Pacific for
   subscription consultancy Zuora.

   "In 2015, [revenue growth] was 13 per cent and now, in 2019, it's about
   22 per cent. That's between five and nine times faster … than the S&P
   500 companies' revenues."

Why subscriptions are good for business

   Mr Ghodosi says subscription services are a "shift away from a
   product-centric mindset to selling … outcomes".

   "The subscription economy is all about, 'How can I service my end
   customer — whether that's a consumer or a business — on what they
   want?'" he says.

   He predicts that in the next couple of years, 70 per cent of Australian
   businesses will offer products and services on a recurring basis.

   staple subscription service for many Australian homes. (ABC Science:

   Gary Mortimer, an associate professor from QUT Business School, says
   it's a symbiotic relationship.

   It's a win for the consumer, who — when dragging a trolley through
   fluorescent neon aisles — doesn't want to have to think about
   replenishing mundane, recurring items, such as cleaning products,
   personal-hygiene products and even toilet paper.

   "Those types of staple products that we always need and always tend to
   run out of work really well as a subscription service … it just turns
   up at the door," Dr Mortimer says.

   And it's a win for the business because they are fostering a
   relationship with the customer — nurturing and ensuring extended
   loyalty — and providing a predictable, recurring source of revenue.

'Flipping the script'

   More than a decade ago, Adobe saw the potential in subscriptions with
   its Photoshop software.

   Up until then, Adobe users were required to purchase expensive licences
   to access the software and pay maintenance on that licence to keep
   receiving the latest updates, but, as Mr Ghodosi explains, the company
   decided to "flip the script on the monetisation".

   "They said, 'Hey, we're no longer going to charge thousands of dollars
   for the licence, we want to build an ongoing relationship with our end
   users'," he says.

   Adobe introduced a recurring revenue model where the customer pays a
   monthly fee, and in addition to receiving the software, customers also
   get regular updates, which add value to the service.

   "You end up having customers for life rather than having to continually
   innovate and hope the customer buys the new version," Mr Ghodosi says.

   Even carmakers — in an industry traditionally focused on selling a
   product — are seeing the advantages of fostering direct relationships
   with customers.

   a four-wheel drive. Photo: A vehicle subscription allows customers to
   change cars as the need arises. (Getty)

   Mr Ghodosi says several leading brands in Europe and North America are
   offering subscription services focused purely on "trying to get you
   from point A to Point B, rather than trying to have you own their
   vehicles".

   For a monthly fee, he says, you can access any car you like.

   "There's no burden of ownership, you don't have to worry about residual
   values, you don't have to worry about resale, you don't have to worry
   about insurance," he says.

   "A good example could be that during a week you're commuting to and
   from work, so you're going to need a small car. At the end of the
   month, or in six weeks' time, you're going on a family trip, so you
   want to give that car back to the auto manufacturer and get a large
   [seven-seater] or four-wheel drive."

The gamble of the 'box'

   An early and popular form of subscription is the "surprise" box, often
   containing beauty products and samples, arriving at your door every
   month.

   Dr Mortimer says the subscription-box market in the US has grown by
   about 100 per cent over the past decade to be worth about $2.5 billion
   annually, and there are more and more Australian businesses and brands
   getting involved.

   part of the appeal of mystery boxes. (Getty: Elitsa Deykova)

   He says a large part of the success of the box model (and something it
   has in common with gambling) is what's known as "operant conditioning"
   — or not knowing if you'll have a positive or negative experience.

   "Think about the pokies. We have a couple of wins and we have a couple
   of losses so we don't feel real good," he says.

   "But then we go again, thinking we'll get a better outcome.

   "Sometimes, [the subscription box] turns up on our door and we love the
   contents. And sometimes, we're a little bit disappointed. But that
   doesn't discourage us. We wait for the next month to see if we get a
   good subscription box.

     "That reward uncertainty is really, really important because if we
     receive the same range of wines every month, very quickly we would
     get very bored of it."

   It's a model that has proved a hit for Philomena Kwok, who runs an
   online business selling boxes of flowers.

   "Each box is very no frills. There's no fancy wrapping, there's no
   arrangement," she says.

   "It's very much like a fruit and veggie box. You get … the best of
   what's in season … and guidance to show you how to put it together for
   your home.

   "My customers don't actually know what's in their box until the very
   day they receive it."

   The Money explains how the Australian economy and everything in it
   works, and how it connects to the global economy.

   Ms Kwok says her subscription service means a steady source of revenue,
   which sets her apart from traditional florists, who make most of their
   money on the big holidays, like Valentine's Day, Mother's Day and
   Christmas.

   Another advantage of her business model is a lack of wastage.

   "A traditional florist might throw out half of their stock every day
   because they need their shops to look full and beautiful and also to
   give customers choice," she says.

   "We don't do that at all so we only provide what's best in season and
   our wastage is probably below 1 per cent."

Who gets a slice of the pie?

   Perhaps the most common and most-often-forgotten subscription is that
   of the ubiquitous mobile phone and the role it plays in facilitating
   external subscriptions via apps.

   stopped new customers from using Apple's payment system. (ABC RN: Ben
   Hays)

   Apple has 1.4 billion devices in circulation, with 1 billion active
   users.

   Technology commentator and app developer Peter Marks says 120 million
   of those Apple users are subscribing to something.

   "These are things that become part of your life," he says.

   "They are rolling subscriptions that get charged every month or every
   year to your account."

   But he says you may not realise that when you purchase a subscription
   via an app bought in the App Store, "Apple takes a 30 per cent cut of
   that … and 15 per cent … year on year after that".

   That translates to a lot of money for Apple.

   "That of course upsets some of the subscription businesses, who feel
   that while Apple adds value or Google adds value with making it easy to
   get the app the first time, once that's done, their relationship is
   really between the consumer and the content maker," Mr Marks says.

   He says Apple may have pocketed up to $256 million last year from its
   cut of the Netflix iOS app — 2018's top-grossing app.

   Netflix has since ended that arrangement, and has stopped new customers
   from using Apple's payment system.

   But divorce hasn't been easy and it may have ongoing ramifications for
   the video-streaming service.

   "If you don't get your subscription through the Apple App Store, the
   application is not allowed to even link out to where to actually get a
   subscription," Mr Marks explains.

   "In fact they cannot tell the user how to do it. You're not allowed to
   put any explanation of how to actually get a username and password."

   He says Netflix will likely absorb the hit because they're a strong
   brand and people can figure it out, "but the fact Apple won't let you
   have even an explanation in there is going to hurt some users".

   But while industry may yet grapple with the mechanics, Mr Marks says:
   "The future is subscriptions."

     "I think everyone wants to get to that place where they have
     long-term relationships with consumers."

   Thirty years ago, Wally Conron was asked to breed a non-shedding guide
   dog. Looking back, he worries that he created a monster.

   "I bred the labradoodle for a blind lady whose husband was allergic to
   dog hair," he says.

   "Why people are breeding them today, I haven't got a clue."

   In the 1980s, Wally worked as the breeding manager for the Royal Guide
   Dogs Association of Australia, now known as Guide Dogs Victoria.

   Most of the time, that meant breeding Labrador pups. But one day he
   received a letter from a blind lady in Hawaii whose husband was
   allergic to long-haired dogs.

   "She wanted to know if we could come up with a dog that she could use
   as a guide dog and her husband wouldn't be allergic to," he says,
   speaking to the ABC podcast Sum Of All Parts.

   At the time, Australia and Hawaii had similar quarantine provisions so
   a partnership had been struck up between Guide Dogs Victoria and Eye of
   the Pacific, a Hawaii-based organisation for the vision impaired.

   Initially, Wally saw the task as fairly straightforward — "the standard
   poodle would do the job".

   But after trialling 33 different standard poodles, Wally came to the
   conclusion that the poodle didn't have the right temperament to be a
   successful guide dog.

   All the while, Wally says he was very aware of the "poor lady sitting
   in Hawaii with no guide dog".

   So after three years of attempting to find a solution, Wally came up
   with the idea of a brand new crossbreed —"a dog with the working
   ability of the Labrador and the coat of the poodle".

   Enter the labradoodle.

The experiment

   Firstly Wally needed to find a suitable standard poodle to breed with
   one of the Guide Dogs Victoria Labrador bitches. He didn't have to look
   too far afield.

   "Our boss had one, a standard poodle, that as far as I knew it had no
   hereditary problems, so I used it," Wally says.

   So one afternoon in 1989, Wally brought Brandy, a Labrador bitch, over
   to John Gosling's house to meet Harley.

   Nine weeks later, Brandy delivered the first known litter of
   labradoodle pups.

   Wally was thrilled, although still slightly apprehensive, unsure if any
   of the three pups would be suitable guide dogs.

   "It was great, but I still had worries. Were they non-allergic? Were
   they going to be suitable?" Wally says.

   Coat clippings and saliva from each of the pups were sent to Hawaii for
   testing and just one of the pups came back compatible.

   That pup was named Sultan.

   Temperamentally, Sultan was considered the best of the three
   labradoodle pups, so Wally says he was trained up and sent off to
   Hawaii to begin work as the world's first labradoodle guide dog.

A gimmick that caught on

   With Sultan in Hawaii, Wally says he still had two other labradoodle
   pups that would make great guide dogs — except no-one wanted them.

   Despite a six-month wait for a Labrador guide dog, Wally says not one
   family was willing to take one of the Labrador crosses.

Listen to the podcast

   Hear the full story of Wally and Sultan — plus Harry the rotund ginger
   mutt — on the ABC podcast Sum Of All Parts.

   Out of sheer frustration, Wally went to the Guide Dogs Victoria PR
   department.

   "I said 'can you get onto the media and tell them that we've bred a
   special breed? A breed called the labradoodle — it's non-allergenic',"
   Wally says.

   So it was then that the name labradoodle was invented: a desperate
   attempt to get guide dog clients on board with this new crossbreed.

   "It was a gimmick. No-one wanted a crossbreed but everybody wanted a
   labradoodle. Same dog, different name."

   And quickly it became apparent that the demand for the labradoodle went
   well beyond the vision impaired community. Guide Dogs Victoria became
   inundated with labradoodle enquiries from all over the world.

   "I could not visualise the publicity that a crossbred dog would get,"
   Wally says.

   "Cars would stop and people would get out of the car and say to me,
   'excuse me what sort of dog is that?' I'd say 'it's a labradoodle!'"

   The reason the labradoodle took off was fairly straightforward,
   according to Jessica Hekman from the Broad Institute in Boston, who
   researches dog behaviour and genetics.

   "A lot of the way that we think about dogs is the story that we can
   tell about the dogs that we've got," Dr Hekman explains.

   "Having the story, 'well this dog is just a mix of a couple of
   different things' — it didn't used to be a good story.

   "So when you start attaching cool names, then it starts turning into a
   new, cool story."

The regret

   It was amongst the media hype that Wally says his feelings about the
   labradoodle began to change.

   "I realised what I had done within a matter of days."

   As a professional dog breeder, Wally says his biggest concern was
   always about breeding the healthiest pups, but he believes that didn't
   end up being the case for a lot of labradoodle breeders "who got on the
   bandwagon".

   "I realised the reason for these unethical, ruthless people [was] to
   breed these dogs and sell them for big bucks," Wally says.

   The popularity of the labradoodle was overwhelming and Wally became
   increasingly concerned about the quality of the breeding process being
   adopted. Thirty years on it still haunts him.

   "I opened a Pandora's box and released a Frankenstein's monster," he
   says.

   "When I'm out and I see these labradoodles I can't help myself, I go
   over them in my mind.

   "I look at it thinking, does it have hip dysplasia, has it got elbow
   problems, any other problems I can see?

   "I find that the biggest majority are either crazy or have a hereditary
   problem. I do see some damn nice labradoodles but they're few and far
   between."

   But not everyone shares Wally's regret.

   John was equally as surprised by the uptake of the breed but saw it as
   a positive turn of events.

   "We could never have thought it was going to become so prolific," he
   says.

   "Our thinking was particularly toward guide dogs and vision-impaired
   people who had a difficulty with an allergy, but it's gone way beyond
   that.

   "It's actually turned out to be something, in my opinion, quite
   fantastic.

   "I don't have regrets at all."

   litter of labradoodle pups would create.

   Dr Hekman says labradoodles are just one of many dog breeds with
   runaway popularity.

   "My feeling is while there are certainly a fair number of people
   crossing poodles to anything and everything — and maybe not always in
   the wisest way — there were always people out there trying to meet the
   insatiable demand that we have for dogs," she says.

The labradoodle legacy

   Even though Wally still regrets creating the labradoodle, his science
   experiment back in the late 80s led to numerous successful labradoodle
   guide dogs, as well as kickstarting the entire "oodle" trend.

   The origins of the cavoodle, groodle, jackapoo, schnoodle, golden
   doodle (the list of poodle crosses really is endless) all stemmed back
   to the birth of Sultan and his labradoodle siblings.

   Additionally, the original labradoodle guide dog, Sultan, served as a
   highly regarded guide dog — so much so that when he was due for
   retirement his owner struggled to decide who should adopt him.

   "The challenge that the client had was that there were so many people
   who knew Sultan, they all wanted him when he retired," John says.

   John had ongoing contact with Sultan, doing annual check-ups in Hawaii.
   So when it came time to retire, Sultan's owner approached John and
   asked if he would like this highly sought-after dog.

   Sultan was flown from Hawaii to Melbourne and spent the last three
   years of his life with John.

   "He came to work with me back at Guide Dogs Victoria where he started,"
   John says.

   And then when Sultan died it only made sense to bury him in John's
   backyard alongside his standard poodle dad, Harley.

   Now in the backyard of this suburban Melbourne home just between the
   hills hoist and the boundary fence, rests the origins of the
   labradoodle.

   Hovering over two large stones that mark the dogs' graves, John
   reflects on Harley and Sultan's life contributions.

   "You were here for a reason," John says, as if speaking directly to the
   dogs. "It was a reason for many people to have good guide dogs.

   "You did what you had to do and you did your best at that."

Giant pumice raft from underwater volcanic eruption makes its way to Great
Barrier Reef

   By Kate McKenna

   Updated August 24, 2019 11:59:44

   Drifting through the ocean, the sailors suddenly lost sight of water.

   Surrounding their boat was a floating mass of pumice rocks — the result
   of an underwater volcanic eruption near Tonga two weeks ago.

Key points:

     * An Australian couple detailed their experience with the "total rock
       rubble slick" on social media while sailing their catamaran to Fiji
     * Pieces of pumice from the pumice raft should start washing up along
       Australia's coastline in seven to 12 months' time
     * Pumice rafts pose a navigational hazard for boats in the area as
       they are very abrasive and can get lodged in rudder systems

   Queensland University of Technology geologist Associate Professor Scott
   Bryan said it "would have been a really eerie experience sailing into
   this sea of floating rock".

   "No longer seeing water and hearing the scratching of the pumice
   against the hull," he said.

   Known as a pumice raft, this so-called island of floating rock is
   gradually heading for Australian shores and is so expansive it can be
   tracked via satellite.

   Australian couple Michael Hoult and Larissa Brill detailed their
   experience in a Facebook post with the "total rock rubble slick" while
   sailing their catamaran to Fiji.

   "The waves were knocked back to almost calm and the boat was slowed to
   1kt," they wrote.

     "The rubble slick went as far as we could see in the moonlight and
     without spotlight — we made a turn to starboard and managed to sail
     clear of the rubble slick."

Marine life 'hitching a ride'

   Associate Professor Bryan said along the way an abundance of marine
   life would attach themselves to the pumice raft, "hitching a ride"
   across the Coral Sea.

   Australia

   "In this 150-odd square kilometres of pumice out there right now,
   there's probably billions to trillions of pieces of pumice all floating
   together and each piece of pumice is a vehicle for some marine
   organism," he said.

   He said pieces of pumice should start washing up along Australia's
   coastline in seven to 12 months.

   "When it gets here, [the pumice raft will be] covered in a whole range
   of organisms of algae and barnacles and corals and crabs and snails and
   worms," he said.

   "We're going to have millions of individual corals and lots of other
   organisms all coming in together with the potential of finding new
   homes along our coastline.

     "This is a way for healthy, young corals to be rapidly introduced to
     the Great Barrier Reef."

   Associate Professor Bryan has studied the phenomenon for two decades,
   and 15 years ago he published research about an earlier eruption
   involving the same volcano near Tonga.

   "I saw pumice along the beach and thought it must have come from some
   eruption, which led me to forensically work out where," he said.

Navigational hazard for boats

   Associate Professor Bryan said this sort of event was occurring every
   five years.

   "[The raft] is a natural mechanism for species to colonise, restock and
   grow in a new environment," he said.

   "It's just one way that nature can help promote regeneration."

   But he warned pumice rafts could also pose a navigational hazard for
   boats in the area.

     "Pumice is very abrasive, it can scrape paint off boats, get lodged
     in the rudder systems, and can certainly be a nuisance and problem
     for boats," Associate Professor Bryan said.

   "It's important for them to not necessarily sail through the pumice
   rafts."

   He said the sailors who encountered the latest pumice raft would
   provide him with samples of the pumice to assist his research.

Why the growing subscription economy spells big bucks for business

   RN
   By Ben Hays and Fiona Pepper for The Money

   Updated February 22, 2019 08:34:24

   Your road-trip playlist is synced, all the TV shows and movies you
   could possibly need for a family getaway are just a tap or click away,
   but how will you fit the whole gang in your three-door hatch?

   Simply tweak your subscription and the kids can now each bring a
   friend, or you can hit the sand dunes in a new four-wheel drive.

   This kind of convenience is already a reality in some parts of the
   world and could soon be en route to a driveway near you.

   The subscription economy. It's not exactly a new concept — most people
   with a smartphone would be making a recurring payment for at least one
   or a combination of newspapers, magazines, music-streaming,
   video-streaming, cloud storage, and of course, the phone itself.

Listen to the story

   The Money takes a look at subscriptions, and how they are changing the
   way we buy goods and services.

   Its success has made it a model business are increasingly adopting.
   From toothbrushes to vegetables, entertainment to cars: providing
   services and products by subscription is a great way for companies to
   get to know you and keep you close.

   And as the list of products grows, so too do the profits.

   America's subscription economy was estimated to be worth $420 billion
   in 2015.

   "The data shows the subscription economy is growing faster, year over
   year," says Iman Ghodosi, general manager of Asia-Pacific for
   subscription consultancy Zuora.

   "In 2015, [revenue growth] was 13 per cent and now, in 2019, it's about
   22 per cent. That's between five and nine times faster … than the S&P
   500 companies' revenues."

Why subscriptions are good for business

   Mr Ghodosi says subscription services are a "shift away from a
   product-centric mindset to selling … outcomes".

   "The subscription economy is all about, 'How can I service my end
   customer — whether that's a consumer or a business — on what they
   want?'" he says.

   He predicts that in the next couple of years, 70 per cent of Australian
   businesses will offer products and services on a recurring basis.

   staple subscription service for many Australian homes. (ABC Science:

   Gary Mortimer, an associate professor from QUT Business School, says
   it's a symbiotic relationship.

   It's a win for the consumer, who — when dragging a trolley through
   fluorescent neon aisles — doesn't want to have to think about
   replenishing mundane, recurring items, such as cleaning products,
   personal-hygiene products and even toilet paper.

   "Those types of staple products that we always need and always tend to
   run out of work really well as a subscription service … it just turns
   up at the door," Dr Mortimer says.

   And it's a win for the business because they are fostering a
   relationship with the customer — nurturing and ensuring extended
   loyalty — and providing a predictable, recurring source of revenue.

'Flipping the script'

   More than a decade ago, Adobe saw the potential in subscriptions with
   its Photoshop software.

   Up until then, Adobe users were required to purchase expensive licences
   to access the software and pay maintenance on that licence to keep
   receiving the latest updates, but, as Mr Ghodosi explains, the company
   decided to "flip the script on the monetisation".

   "They said, 'Hey, we're no longer going to charge thousands of dollars
   for the licence, we want to build an ongoing relationship with our end
   users'," he says.

   Adobe introduced a recurring revenue model where the customer pays a
   monthly fee, and in addition to receiving the software, customers also
   get regular updates, which add value to the service.

   "You end up having customers for life rather than having to continually
   innovate and hope the customer buys the new version," Mr Ghodosi says.

   Even carmakers — in an industry traditionally focused on selling a
   product — are seeing the advantages of fostering direct relationships
   with customers.

   a four-wheel drive. Photo: A vehicle subscription allows customers to
   change cars as the need arises. (Getty)

   Mr Ghodosi says several leading brands in Europe and North America are
   offering subscription services focused purely on "trying to get you
   from point A to Point B, rather than trying to have you own their
   vehicles".

   For a monthly fee, he says, you can access any car you like.

   "There's no burden of ownership, you don't have to worry about residual
   values, you don't have to worry about resale, you don't have to worry
   about insurance," he says.

   "A good example could be that during a week you're commuting to and
   from work, so you're going to need a small car. At the end of the
   month, or in six weeks' time, you're going on a family trip, so you
   want to give that car back to the auto manufacturer and get a large
   [seven-seater] or four-wheel drive."

The gamble of the 'box'

   An early and popular form of subscription is the "surprise" box, often
   containing beauty products and samples, arriving at your door every
   month.

   Dr Mortimer says the subscription-box market in the US has grown by
   about 100 per cent over the past decade to be worth about $2.5 billion
   annually, and there are more and more Australian businesses and brands
   getting involved.

   part of the appeal of mystery boxes. (Getty: Elitsa Deykova)

   He says a large part of the success of the box model (and something it
   has in common with gambling) is what's known as "operant conditioning"
   — or not knowing if you'll have a positive or negative experience.

   "Think about the pokies. We have a couple of wins and we have a couple
   of losses so we don't feel real good," he says.

   "But then we go again, thinking we'll get a better outcome.

   "Sometimes, [the subscription box] turns up on our door and we love the
   contents. And sometimes, we're a little bit disappointed. But that
   doesn't discourage us. We wait for the next month to see if we get a
   good subscription box.

     "That reward uncertainty is really, really important because if we
     receive the same range of wines every month, very quickly we would
     get very bored of it."

   It's a model that has proved a hit for Philomena Kwok, who runs an
   online business selling boxes of flowers.

   "Each box is very no frills. There's no fancy wrapping, there's no
   arrangement," she says.

   "It's very much like a fruit and veggie box. You get … the best of
   what's in season … and guidance to show you how to put it together for
   your home.

   "My customers don't actually know what's in their box until the very
   day they receive it."

   The Money explains how the Australian economy and everything in it
   works, and how it connects to the global economy.

   Ms Kwok says her subscription service means a steady source of revenue,
   which sets her apart from traditional florists, who make most of their
   money on the big holidays, like Valentine's Day, Mother's Day and
   Christmas.

   Another advantage of her business model is a lack of wastage.

   "A traditional florist might throw out half of their stock every day
   because they need their shops to look full and beautiful and also to
   give customers choice," she says.

   "We don't do that at all so we only provide what's best in season and
   our wastage is probably below 1 per cent."

Who gets a slice of the pie?

   Perhaps the most common and most-often-forgotten subscription is that
   of the ubiquitous mobile phone and the role it plays in facilitating
   external subscriptions via apps.

   stopped new customers from using Apple's payment system. (ABC RN: Ben
   Hays)

   Apple has 1.4 billion devices in circulation, with 1 billion active
   users.

   Technology commentator and app developer Peter Marks says 120 million
   of those Apple users are subscribing to something.

   "These are things that become part of your life," he says.

   "They are rolling subscriptions that get charged every month or every
   year to your account."

   But he says you may not realise that when you purchase a subscription
   via an app bought in the App Store, "Apple takes a 30 per cent cut of
   that … and 15 per cent … year on year after that".

   That translates to a lot of money for Apple.

   "That of course upsets some of the subscription businesses, who feel
   that while Apple adds value or Google adds value with making it easy to
   get the app the first time, once that's done, their relationship is
   really between the consumer and the content maker," Mr Marks says.

   He says Apple may have pocketed up to $256 million last year from its
   cut of the Netflix iOS app — 2018's top-grossing app.

   Netflix has since ended that arrangement, and has stopped new customers
   from using Apple's payment system.

   But divorce hasn't been easy and it may have ongoing ramifications for
   the video-streaming service.

   "If you don't get your subscription through the Apple App Store, the
   application is not allowed to even link out to where to actually get a
   subscription," Mr Marks explains.

   "In fact they cannot tell the user how to do it. You're not allowed to
   put any explanation of how to actually get a username and password."

   He says Netflix will likely absorb the hit because they're a strong
   brand and people can figure it out, "but the fact Apple won't let you
   have even an explanation in there is going to hurt some users".

   But while industry may yet grapple with the mechanics, Mr Marks says:
   "The future is subscriptions."

     "I think everyone wants to get to that place where they have
     long-term relationships with consumers."

   Thirty years ago, Wally Conron was asked to breed a non-shedding guide
   dog. Looking back, he worries that he created a monster.

   "I bred the labradoodle for a blind lady whose husband was allergic to
   dog hair," he says.

   "Why people are breeding them today, I haven't got a clue."

   In the 1980s, Wally worked as the breeding manager for the Royal Guide
   Dogs Association of Australia, now known as Guide Dogs Victoria.

   Most of the time, that meant breeding Labrador pups. But one day he
   received a letter from a blind lady in Hawaii whose husband was
   allergic to long-haired dogs.

   "She wanted to know if we could come up with a dog that she could use
   as a guide dog and her husband wouldn't be allergic to," he says,
   speaking to the ABC podcast Sum Of All Parts.

   At the time, Australia and Hawaii had similar quarantine provisions so
   a partnership had been struck up between Guide Dogs Victoria and Eye of
   the Pacific, a Hawaii-based organisation for the vision impaired.

   Initially, Wally saw the task as fairly straightforward — "the standard
   poodle would do the job".

   But after trialling 33 different standard poodles, Wally came to the
   conclusion that the poodle didn't have the right temperament to be a
   successful guide dog.

   All the while, Wally says he was very aware of the "poor lady sitting
   in Hawaii with no guide dog".

   So after three years of attempting to find a solution, Wally came up
   with the idea of a brand new crossbreed —"a dog with the working
   ability of the Labrador and the coat of the poodle".

   Enter the labradoodle.

The experiment

   Firstly Wally needed to find a suitable standard poodle to breed with
   one of the Guide Dogs Victoria Labrador bitches. He didn't have to look
   too far afield.

   "Our boss had one, a standard poodle, that as far as I knew it had no
   hereditary problems, so I used it," Wally says.

   labradoodle.

   So one afternoon in 1989, Wally brought Brandy, a Labrador bitch, over
   to John Gosling's house to meet Harley.

   Nine weeks later, Brandy delivered the first known litter of
   labradoodle pups.

   Wally was thrilled, although still slightly apprehensive, unsure if any
   of the three pups would be suitable guide dogs.

   "It was great, but I still had worries. Were they non-allergic? Were
   they going to be suitable?" Wally says.

   Coat clippings and saliva from each of the pups were sent to Hawaii for
   testing and just one of the pups came back compatible.

   That pup was named Sultan.

   Temperamentally, Sultan was considered the best of the three
   labradoodle pups, so Wally says he was trained up and sent off to
   Hawaii to begin work as the world's first labradoodle guide dog.

A gimmick that caught on

   With Sultan in Hawaii, Wally says he still had two other labradoodle
   pups that would make great guide dogs — except no-one wanted them.

   Despite a six-month wait for a Labrador guide dog, Wally says not one
   family was willing to take one of the Labrador crosses.

Listen to the podcast

   Hear the full story of Wally and Sultan — plus Harry the rotund ginger
   mutt — on the ABC podcast Sum Of All Parts.

   Out of sheer frustration, Wally went to the Guide Dogs Victoria PR
   department.

   "I said 'can you get onto the media and tell them that we've bred a
   special breed? A breed called the labradoodle — it's non-allergenic',"
   Wally says.

   So it was then that the name labradoodle was invented: a desperate
   attempt to get guide dog clients on board with this new crossbreed.

   "It was a gimmick. No-one wanted a crossbreed but everybody wanted a
   labradoodle. Same dog, different name."

   And quickly it became apparent that the demand for the labradoodle went
   well beyond the vision impaired community. Guide Dogs Victoria became
   inundated with labradoodle enquiries from all over the world.

   "I could not visualise the publicity that a crossbred dog would get,"
   Wally says.

   "Cars would stop and people would get out of the car and say to me,
   'excuse me what sort of dog is that?' I'd say 'it's a labradoodle!'"

   Dog-genetics researcher Jessica Hekman says the labradoodle caught on
   as a breed because of its 'cool' story.

   Two labradoodle pups sitting on grass.

   Dog-genetics researcher Jessica Hekman says the labradoodle caught on
   as a breed because of its 'cool' story.

   The reason the labradoodle took off was fairly straightforward,
   according to Jessica Hekman from the Broad Institute in Boston, who
   researches dog behaviour and genetics.

   "A lot of the way that we think about dogs is the story that we can
   tell about the dogs that we've got," Dr Hekman explains.

   "Having the story, 'well this dog is just a mix of a couple of
   different things' — it didn't used to be a good story.

   "So when you start attaching cool names, then it starts turning into a
   new, cool story."

The regret

   It was amongst the media hype that Wally says his feelings about the
   labradoodle began to change.

   "I realised what I had done within a matter of days."

   As a professional dog breeder, Wally says his biggest concern was
   always about breeding the healthiest pups, but he believes that didn't
   end up being the case for a lot of labradoodle breeders "who got on the
   bandwagon".

   "I realised the reason for these unethical, ruthless people [was] to
   breed these dogs and sell them for big bucks," Wally says.

   The popularity of the labradoodle was overwhelming and Wally became
   increasingly concerned about the quality of the breeding process being
   adopted. Thirty years on it still haunts him.

   "I opened a Pandora's box and released a Frankenstein's monster," he
   says.

   "When I'm out and I see these labradoodles I can't help myself, I go
   over them in my mind.

   "I look at it thinking, does it have hip dysplasia, has it got elbow
   problems, any other problems I can see?

   "I find that the biggest majority are either crazy or have a hereditary
   problem. I do see some damn nice labradoodles but they're few and far
   between."

   But not everyone shares Wally's regret.

   John was equally as surprised by the uptake of the breed but saw it as
   a positive turn of events.

   "We could never have thought it was going to become so prolific," he
   says.

   "Our thinking was particularly toward guide dogs and vision-impaired
   people who had a difficulty with an allergy, but it's gone way beyond
   that.

   "It's actually turned out to be something, in my opinion, quite
   fantastic.

   "I don't have regrets at all."

   litter of labradoodle pups would create.

   Dr Hekman says labradoodles are just one of many dog breeds with
   runaway popularity.

   "My feeling is while there are certainly a fair number of people
   crossing poodles to anything and everything — and maybe not always in
   the wisest way — there were always people out there trying to meet the
   insatiable demand that we have for dogs," she says.

The labradoodle legacy

   Even though Wally still regrets creating the labradoodle, his science
   experiment back in the late 80s led to numerous successful labradoodle
   guide dogs, as well as kickstarting the entire "oodle" trend.

   The origins of the cavoodle, groodle, jackapoo, schnoodle, golden
   doodle (the list of poodle crosses really is endless) all stemmed back
   to the birth of Sultan and his labradoodle siblings.

   Additionally, the original labradoodle guide dog, Sultan, served as a
   highly regarded guide dog — so much so that when he was due for
   retirement his owner struggled to decide who should adopt him.

   "The challenge that the client had was that there were so many people
   who knew Sultan, they all wanted him when he retired," John says.

   John had ongoing contact with Sultan, doing annual check-ups in Hawaii.
   So when it came time to retire, Sultan's owner approached John and
   asked if he would like this highly sought-after dog.

   Sultan was flown from Hawaii to Melbourne and spent the last three
   years of his life with John.

   "He came to work with me back at Guide Dogs Victoria where he started,"
   John says.

   And then when Sultan died it only made sense to bury him in John's
   backyard alongside his standard poodle dad, Harley.

   Now in the backyard of this suburban Melbourne home just between the
   hills hoist and the boundary fence, rests the origins of the
   labradoodle.

   Hovering over two large stones that mark the dogs' graves, John
   reflects on Harley and Sultan's life contributions.

   "You were here for a reason," John says, as if speaking directly to the
   dogs. "It was a reason for many people to have good guide dogs.

   "You did what you had to do and you did your best at that."
