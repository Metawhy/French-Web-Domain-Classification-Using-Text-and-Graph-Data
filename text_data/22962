What is Modernizr?

   It’s a collection of superfast tests – or “detects” as we like to call
   them – which run as your web page loads, then you can use the results
   to tailor the experience to the user.

Why do I need it?

   All web developers come up against differences between browsers and
   devices. That’s largely due to different feature sets: the latest
   versions of the popular browsers can do some awesome things which older
   browsers can’t – but we still have to support the older ones.

   Modernizr makes it easy to deliver tiered experiences: make use of the
   latest and greatest features in browsers which support them, without
   leaving less fortunate users high and dry.

       Description

       This does not necessarily reflect a touchscreen device:
          + Older touchscreen devices only emulate mouse events
          + Modern IE touch devices implement the Pointer Events API
            instead: use Modernizr.pointerevents to detect support for
            that
          + Some browsers & OS setups may enable touch APIs when no
            touchscreen is connected
          + Future browsers may implement other event models for touch
            interactions
       See this article: You Can't Detect A Touchscreen.
       It's recommended to bind both mouse and touch/pointer events
       simultaneously – see this HTML5 Rocks tutorial.

       Flex Line Wrapping
       Description
       Detects support for the flex-wrap CSS property, part of Flexbox,
       which isn’t present in all Flexbox implementations (notably
       Firefox).
       This featured in both the 'tweener' syntax (implemented by IE10)
       and the 'modern' syntax (implemented by others). This detect will
       return true for either of these implementations, as long as the
       flex-wrap property is supported. So to ensure the modern syntax is
       supported, use together with Modernizr.flexbox:
if (Modernizr.flexbox && Modernizr.flexwrap) {
  // Modern Flexbox with `flex-wrap` supported
}
else {
  // Either old Flexbox syntax, or `flex-wrap` not supported
}

       Usage
