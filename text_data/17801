   5G DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION IT INFRASTRUCTURE TECHNOLOGY

A New Digital Stack: The Direct Route Telco Transformation

   By Jennifer Kyriakakis | January 22, 2019
   All 5G AGILE DEVELOPMENT CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION
   INNOVATION IoT IT INFRASTRUCTURE ON-DEMAND POINT OF VIEW TECHNOLOGY
   [5G____________________]

   With each G, expectations change and capabilities increase. What
   started as a network for mobile phone calls in the ’90s eventually
   evolved into a network for data in the form of information,
   entertainment and productivity.

   5G, like the Gs before, brings many new expectations and capabilities
   but is primarily anticipated to improve the overall customer
   experience. However, improving the customer experience covers a lot of
   ground and poses obstacles for operators as they are faced with the
   task of updating their infrastructure to support digitalization. Legacy
   tech stacks are not equipped to handle this transformation, which
   leaves operators scrambling to upgrade their systems. There is another
   path that avoids this pain point, and that is starting over with a new
   digital stack.

   In the past, when standardized processes were more important than
   customer experience, legacy platforms for billing, CRM and order
   management did exactly what was asked of them. Today, it is not so
   simple. The shift in user expectations means Telcos need to reconsider
   how they digitally transform, or risk customers leaving for better
   service elsewhere.

   Hoping that subscribers will have a better experience with outdated BSS
   is like offering them a compass, instead of GPS, for directions and
   keeping your fingers crossed that they get to their destination. The
   consumer knows a better experience exists and giving them anything less
   is objectionable.

Moving Beyond Another BSS Upgrade

   While it’s tempting to squeeze the most out of expensive legacy
   architectures, sticking with what exists and attempting to update
   current systems has failed to usher change in the Telco environment.
   Firstly, because standing BSS technologies were designed for the
   demands of the past to support end of month billing, retail stores,
   call center care and voice-centric services. Second, while enhancements
   to existing BSS infrastructure may deliver slightly improved results,
   it doesn’t alleviate legacy issues with IT silos, scalability, upgrades
   and the high cost of process change. Creating a new, more agile IT
   infrastructure based on a real-time digital commerce platform and a
   self-care driven engagement layer offers the necessary traditional
   functionality while dramatically improving the customer experience.
   “Starting over” with a unified commerce platform that provides
   network-grade reliability in a high volume, ultra-low latency, complex,
   multi-network environment is what’s needed to support monetizing the
   network(s) across all parts of the business. A new digital stack lays
   the foundation to capitalize on the opportunities created from
   digitization, IoT and 5G.

A Single Source. A Single Stack.

   Sometimes an old car just can’t be fixed no matter how many times you
   take it to the shop. You just need a new car. The same can be said of
   legacy BSS. Existing systems are burdened with siloed data and
   infrastructure. When a Telco has a variety of subscriber segments and
   service types, each with its own payment methods and price plans, all
   run on multiple systems, the silos become very complex and expensive to
   manage.

   A new digital stack offers a single source of data (truth!) that
   streamlines the workflow by making accurate real-time information
   available to all internal systems and external channels. The result is
   improved customer experiences, immediate monetization opportunities and
   more efficient workflows. This is where true digital transformation
   begins.

Open Published APIs and Configuration-Based Software

   Traditional BSS architectures were custom tailored for each operator’s
   exact needs. While it (sort-of) worked then, it most definitely doesn’t
   work now. No two deployments were the same and many of the BSS
   components came from different vendors which were glued together with
   middleware, making any change both risky and time-consuming. In today’s
   fast-moving market, operators are now forced to struggle with the
   cumbersome bespoke software that requires costly custom coding and
   extensive testing for even minor changes or new features. As a result,
   all that need for customization now means that operators are less able
   to respond to the market and less capable of launching new products.

   With a new digital BSS stack, operators can move beyond today’s
   limitations and bring agile business practices into the heart of their
   organizations. Modern capabilities, like open published APIs and
   configuration-based software, make it faster to deploy and more
   accessible to operate.

Telcos Do Not Need to Rely on Heavy System Integration

   It is said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over
   and over and hoping for different results. The traditional Telco model
   must change if we expect true transformation to happen. The pitfalls of
   heavy system integration are well understood. A new digital stack that
   is designed from the onset to be configurable, automated and upgradable
   will be ready for 5G and new commercial opportunities without the need
   for massive retooling or re-architecting.

   Transformation doesn’t happen overnight, but to remain relevant in
   today’s digital-first environment, Telcos must break free of cumbersome
   transformation projects quickly and prepare to stay competitive or face
   the threat of being left behind. The next decade will be a golden one
   for Telco if the industry embraces and innovates around new
   monetization opportunities. At the core of finding innovation is
   choosing the right platforms on which to build new operating models and
   future-proof the business. A new digital stack positions Telcos to be
   digital leaders.

   5G DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION IT INFRASTRUCTURE TECHNOLOGY

A New Digital Stack: The Direct Route Telco Transformation

   By Jennifer Kyriakakis | January 22, 2019

   [5G____________________]

   With each G, expectations change and capabilities increase. What
   started as a network for mobile phone calls in the ’90s eventually
   evolved into a network for data in the form of information,
   entertainment and productivity.

   5G, like the Gs before, brings many new expectations and capabilities
   but is primarily anticipated to improve the overall customer
   experience. However, improving the customer experience covers a lot of
   ground and poses obstacles for operators as they are faced with the
   task of updating their infrastructure to support digitalization. Legacy
   tech stacks are not equipped to handle this transformation, which
   leaves operators scrambling to upgrade their systems. There is another
   path that avoids this pain point, and that is starting over with a new
   digital stack.

   In the past, when standardized processes were more important than
   customer experience, legacy platforms for billing, CRM and order
   management did exactly what was asked of them. Today, it is not so
   simple. The shift in user expectations means Telcos need to reconsider
   how they digitally transform, or risk customers leaving for better
   service elsewhere.

   Hoping that subscribers will have a better experience with outdated BSS
   is like offering them a compass, instead of GPS, for directions and
   keeping your fingers crossed that they get to their destination. The
   consumer knows a better experience exists and giving them anything less
   is objectionable.

Moving Beyond Another BSS Upgrade

   While it’s tempting to squeeze the most out of expensive legacy
   architectures, sticking with what exists and attempting to update
   current systems has failed to usher change in the Telco environment.
   Firstly, because standing BSS technologies were designed for the
   demands of the past to support end of month billing, retail stores,
   call center care and voice-centric services. Second, while enhancements
   to existing BSS infrastructure may deliver slightly improved results,
   it doesn’t alleviate legacy issues with IT silos, scalability, upgrades
   and the high cost of process change. Creating a new, more agile IT
   infrastructure based on a real-time digital commerce platform and a
   self-care driven engagement layer offers the necessary traditional
   functionality while dramatically improving the customer experience.
   “Starting over” with a unified commerce platform that provides
   network-grade reliability in a high volume, ultra-low latency, complex,
   multi-network environment is what’s needed to support monetizing the
   network(s) across all parts of the business. A new digital stack lays
   the foundation to capitalize on the opportunities created from
   digitization, IoT and 5G.

A Single Source. A Single Stack.

   Sometimes an old car just can’t be fixed no matter how many times you
   take it to the shop. You just need a new car. The same can be said of
   legacy BSS. Existing systems are burdened with siloed data and
   infrastructure. When a Telco has a variety of subscriber segments and
   service types, each with its own payment methods and price plans, all
   run on multiple systems, the silos become very complex and expensive to
   manage.

   A new digital stack offers a single source of data (truth!) that
   streamlines the workflow by making accurate real-time information
   available to all internal systems and external channels. The result is
   improved customer experiences, immediate monetization opportunities and
   more efficient workflows. This is where true digital transformation
   begins.

Open Published APIs and Configuration-Based Software

   Traditional BSS architectures were custom tailored for each operator’s
   exact needs. While it (sort-of) worked then, it most definitely doesn’t
   work now. No two deployments were the same and many of the BSS
   components came from different vendors which were glued together with
   middleware, making any change both risky and time-consuming. In today’s
   fast-moving market, operators are now forced to struggle with the
   cumbersome bespoke software that requires costly custom coding and
   extensive testing for even minor changes or new features. As a result,
   all that need for customization now means that operators are less able
   to respond to the market and less capable of launching new products.

   With a new digital BSS stack, operators can move beyond today’s
   limitations and bring agile business practices into the heart of their
   organizations. Modern capabilities, like open published APIs and
   configuration-based software, make it faster to deploy and more
   accessible to operate.

Telcos Do Not Need to Rely on Heavy System Integration

   It is said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over
   and over and hoping for different results. The traditional Telco model
   must change if we expect true transformation to happen. The pitfalls of
   heavy system integration are well understood. A new digital stack that
   is designed from the onset to be configurable, automated and upgradable
   will be ready for 5G and new commercial opportunities without the need
   for massive retooling or re-architecting.

   Transformation doesn’t happen overnight, but to remain relevant in
   today’s digital-first environment, Telcos must break free of cumbersome
   transformation projects quickly and prepare to stay competitive or face
   the threat of being left behind. The next decade will be a golden one
   for Telco if the industry embraces and innovates around new
   monetization opportunities. At the core of finding innovation is
   choosing the right platforms on which to build new operating models and
   future-proof the business. A new digital stack positions Telcos to be
   digital leaders.
