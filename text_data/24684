Information operations directed at Hong Kong

   By Twitter Safety
   Monday, 19 August 2019
   Link copied successfully

   We are disclosing a significant state-backed information operation
   focused on the situation in Hong Kong, specifically the protest
   movement and their calls for political change.
   What we are disclosing
   This disclosure consists of 936 accounts originating from within the
   People’s Republic of China (PRC). Overall, these accounts were
   deliberately and specifically attempting to sow political discord in
   Hong Kong, including undermining the legitimacy and political positions
   of the protest movement on the ground. Based on our intensive
   investigations, we have reliable evidence to support that this is a
   coordinated state-backed operation. Specifically, we identified large
   clusters of accounts behaving in a coordinated manner to amplify
   messages related to the Hong Kong protests.

   As Twitter is blocked in PRC, many of these accounts accessed Twitter
   using VPNs. However, some accounts accessed Twitter from specific
   unblocked IP addresses originating in mainland China. The accounts we
   are sharing today represent the most active portions of this campaign;
   a larger, spammy network of approximately 200,000 accounts — many
   created following our initial suspensions — were proactively suspended
   before they were substantially active on the service.

   All the accounts have been suspended for a range of violations of our
   platform manipulation policies, which we define as:
     * Spam
     * Coordinated activity
     * Fake accounts
     * Attributed activity
     * Ban evasion

   Examples of violative content

   Next steps
   Covert, manipulative behaviors have no place on our service — they
   violate the fundamental principles on which our company is built. As we
   have said before, it is clear that information operations and
   coordinated inauthentic behavior will not cease. These deceptive
   strategies have been around for far longer than Twitter has existed.
   They adapt and change as the geopolitical terrain evolves worldwide and
   as new technologies emerge. For our part, we are committed to
   understanding and combating how bad-faith actors use our services.
   Today we are adding archives containing complete Tweet and user
   information for the 936 accounts we’ve disclosed to our archive of
   information operations — the largest of its kind in the industry.
   We will continue to be vigilant, learning from this network and
   proactively enforcing our policies to serve the public conversation. We
   hope that by being transparent and open we will empower further
   learning and public understanding of these nefarious tactics. You can
   access relevant account and Tweet information on our dedicated Election
   Integrity Hub.

   Note: We have divided these archives into two parts to better enable
   review of the intersecting networks of accounts which comprise this
   campaign. We have evidence to indicate that both sets are associated
   with the same entity.

Tips

Automation and the use of multiple accounts

   By Yoel Roth
   Wednesday, 21 February 2018
   Link copied successfully

   Keeping Twitter safe and free from spam is a top priority for us. One
   of the most common spam violations we see is the use of multiple
   accounts and the Twitter developer platform to attempt to artificially
   amplify or inflate the prominence of certain Tweets. To be clear:
   Twitter prohibits any attempt to use automation for the purposes of
   posting or disseminating spam, and such behavior may result in
   enforcement action.

   In January, we announced that as part of our Information Quality
   efforts we would be making changes to TweetDeck and the Twitter API to
   limit the ability of users to perform coordinated actions across
   multiple accounts. These changes are an important step in ensuring we
   stay ahead of malicious activity targeting the crucial conversations
   taking place on Twitter — including elections in the United States and
   around the world. Today, we’re sharing details about those changes, as
   well as important guidance for developers on how to comply with these
   rules.

   Please review this guidance carefully, as you may be required to make
   changes to your application or service.

   Do not (and do not allow your users to) simultaneously post identical
   or substantially similar content to multiple accounts. For example,
   your service should not permit a user to select several accounts they
   control from which to publish a given Tweet.
     * This applies regardless of whether the Tweets are published to
       Twitter at the same time, or are scheduled/queued for future
       publication.
     * As an alternative to posting identical content, you can Retweet
       content from one account from the other accounts you wish to share
       that post from. This should only be done from a small number of
       distinct accounts that you directly control. Please note that bulk,
       aggressive, or very high-volume automated Retweeting is not
       permitted under the Automation Rules, and may be subject to
       enforcement actions.

   Do not (and do not allow your users to) simultaneously perform actions
   such as Likes, Retweets, or follows from multiple accounts. For
   example, your service should not permit a user to select several
   accounts they control to follow a specified account.
     * For additional information on aggressive or inorganic following
       behavior, please refer to this developer forum post.
     * For additional information on the appropriate use of automation for
       replies and mentions, please refer to this developer forum post.

   The use of any form of automation (including scheduling) to post
   identical or substantially similar content, or to perform actions such
   as Likes or Retweets, across many accounts that have authorized your
   app (whether or not you created or directly control those accounts) is
   not permitted. For example, applications that coordinate activity
   across multiple accounts to simultaneously post Tweets with a specific
   hashtag (e.g. in an attempt to cause that topic to trend) are
   prohibited.
     * While we continue to permit cross-posting outside information (such
       as weather alerts or RSS feeds) to Twitter using automation, you
       should only post this content to one account you control.
     * As a sole exception to this rule, applications that broadcast or
       share weather, emergency, or other public service announcements of
       broad community interest (for example, earthquake or tsunami
       alerts) are permitted to post this content across multiple accounts
       who have authorized an app.

   Today, we’re also introducing changes to TweetDeck’s multiple account
   functionality to reflect this guidance. Users of TweetDeck will no
   longer be able to select multiple accounts through which to perform an
   action such as Tweeting, Retweeting, liking, or following.

   If your app or service includes features which allow users to perform
   simultaneous actions across multiple accounts, you should make changes
   to bring it into compliance with this policy by March 23, 2018. Failure
   to comply with these rules could result in enforcement action, up to
   and including the suspension of associated applications and accounts.

   While we provide detailed definitions of what constitutes spam in the
   Twitter Rules and Automation Rules, you should keep these two policies
   front of mind whenever you use the Twitter API to publish, share, or
   engage with content on Twitter:
     * Posting duplicative or substantially similar content, replies, or
       mentions over multiple accounts you control, or creating duplicate
       or substantially similar accounts, with or without the use of
       automation, is never allowed.
     * Posting multiple updates (on a single account or across multiple
       accounts you control) to a trending or popular topic (for instance,
       through the use of a specific hashtag) with an intent to subvert or
       manipulate the topic, or to artificially inflate the prominence of
       a hashtag or topic, is never allowed.

   You can ask questions about any of our developer policies, and
   specifically about this clarification, using the Rules and Policies
   category in the Developer Forums.

An easier way to save and share Tweets

   By Jesar Shah
   Wednesday, 28 February 2018
   Link copied successfully

   From articles and threads to videos and GIFs, timelines are packed with
   Tweets that you don't always have time to fully explore in the moment.
   You’ve told us you want to save them for later.

   Hello, Bookmarks!

   Today, we’re introducing Bookmarks, an easy way to save Tweets for
   quick access later. But wait, there’s more! Today’s update makes
   sharing better, too. With our new “share” icon on every Tweet, you’ll
   be able to bookmark a Tweet, share via Direct Message, or share off of
   Twitter any number of ways. Because we put all sharing actions together
   in one place, it’s easier to save and share privately or publicly — in
   the moment, or later.

   How It Works

   To bookmark a Tweet, tap the share icon under the Tweet and select,
   “Add Tweet to Bookmarks”. To find it later, tap “Bookmarks” from your
   profile icon menu. You can remove Tweets from your Bookmarks at any
   time. Also, only you can see what you’ve bookmarked. Learn more about
   how to bookmark in our Help Center.

   Bookmarks help people keep up with the best of Twitter. You can save a
   Tweet with a live morning show like Buzzfeed’s #AM2DM to watch at
   another time, bookmark a thread from @Lin_Manuel about new Hamilton
   music to come back to, and save Tweets with links to interesting
   articles for later reading or sharing. You’ll no doubt show us more
   creative uses for Bookmarks than we ever imagined! (You have a tendency
   to do that on Twitter.)

   Better Because of Your Feedback

   We Tweeted ongoing updates as we built Bookmarks so we could
   incorporate your input as we worked. By working this way, we learned
   that you like to save replies so you can answer later and that you may
   share a Tweet hours or days later after you’ve bookmarked it. Thank you
   for being part of this process — your feedback was valuable in building
   this update, and it made it all the more fun for us as we built a new
   feature for you. As a result, we all have an easier way to save, share,
   and stay informed.

   Bookmarks are now rolling out globally on Twitter for iOS and Android,
   Twitter Lite, and mobile.twitter.com. Thanks for your collaboration to
   make Bookmarks happen. Happy bookmarking!

Tweeting Made Easier

   By Aliza Rosen
   Tuesday, 7 November 2017
   Link copied successfully

   In September, we launched a test that expanded the 140 character limit
   so every person around the world could express themselves easily in a
   Tweet. Our goal was to make this possible while ensuring we keep the
   speed and brevity that makes Twitter, Twitter. Looking at all the data,
   we’re excited to share we’ve achieved this goal and are rolling the
   change out to all languages where cramming was an issue.*

   During the first few days of the test many people Tweeted the full 280
   limit because it was new and novel, but soon after behavior normalized
   (more on this below). We saw when people needed to use more than 140
   characters, they Tweeted more easily and more often. But importantly,
   people Tweeted below 140 most of the time and the brevity of Twitter
   remained.

   Highlights are below and in our additional blogs about our
   experimentation process, extensive data analysis, research, and design
   work.

   Easier to Tweet

   Historically, 9% of Tweets in English hit the character limit. This
   reflects the challenge of fitting a thought into a Tweet, often
   resulting in lots of time spent editing and even at times abandoning
   Tweets before sending. With the expanded character count, this problem
   was massively reduced – that number dropped to only 1% of Tweets
   running up against the limit. Since we saw Tweets hit the character
   limit less often, we believe people spent less time editing their
   Tweets in the composer. This shows that more space makes it easier for
   people to fit thoughts in a Tweet, so they could say what they want to
   say, and send Tweets faster than before. You can see this happening in
   the graph below.

   [xHrnqf1T_normal.jpg]

   Keeping Twitter’s brevity

   We – and many of you – were concerned that timelines may fill up with
   280 character Tweets, and people with the new limit would always use up
   the whole space. But that didn’t happen. Only 5% of Tweets sent were
   longer than 140 characters and only 2% were over 190 characters. As a
   result, your timeline reading experience should not substantially
   change, you’ll still see about the same amount of Tweets in your
   timeline. For reference, in the timeline, Tweets with an image or poll
   usually take up more space than a 190 character Tweet.

   It’s worth emphasizing again that people in the test got very excited
   about the extra space in the beginning and many Tweets went way beyond
   140. People did silly (creative!) things like writing just a few
   characters per line to make their Tweets extra large. It was a
   temporary effect and didn’t last long. We expect to see some of this
   novelty effect spike again with this week’s launch and expect it to
   resume to normal behavior soon after.

   Engagement

   In addition to more Tweeting, people who had more room to Tweet
   received more engagement (Likes, Retweets, @mentions), got more
   followers, and spent more time on Twitter. People in the experiment
   told us that a higher character limit made them feel more satisfied
   with how they expressed themselves on Twitter, their ability to find
   good content, and Twitter overall.

   We are making this change after listening and observing a problem our
   global community was having (it wasn’t easy enough to Tweet!), studying
   data to understand how we could improve, trying it out, and listening
   to your feedback. We’ll continue listening and working to make Twitter
   easier for everyone while making sure we keep what you love.

   *Japanese, Korean, and Chinese will continue to have 140 characters
   because cramming is not an issue in these languages. In fact, these
   languages have always been able to say more with their Tweets because
   of the density of their writing systems. We shared more about this
   thinking and our research here.

   **On this graph, there is a small bump in the red line (which
   represents the group with 280 characters) at 140 because these people
   were also using older Twitter clients which didn’t have the ability to
   send longer Tweets, so they continued to hit the 140 character limit.
   This graph is for English-only Tweets.

Introducing Twitter Dashboard

   By �@noahmp�
   Tuesday, 28 June 2016
   Link copied successfully

   For businesses, Twitter is a place to share news, tell stories, and
   have conversations that support, educate, and delight their customers.
   It’s a place for authentic interactions – but we know that creating
   these kinds of connections isn’t always easy for businesses that are
   time and resource-constrained. That’s why we built a brand new app to
   help the busy people behind these businesses. Introducing: Twitter
   Dashboard.

   Twitter Dashboard is a powerful tool designed to help businesses
   connect with their customers and community. Large, dedicated teams
   typically have the advantage of sophisticated tools provided by Twitter
   ecosystem partners. Today we’re offering a free tool to give all
   businesses an advantage in the way they use Twitter. With an iOS app
   and desktop web experience, Dashboard offers a single destination to
   get things done. It gives business owners a clear picture of what’s
   being said about their businesses, lets them schedule Tweets, and
   offers insights about their Tweet performance.

   Dashboard can help you:

   Easily engage with your audience
   Create a custom feed to find out what’s being said about your business.
   (Chances are there’s more than the mentions you’d normally be notified
   about!) Use your custom feed to get right to the Tweets you want to see
   first and better engage with your community. For example, if you work
   at a cafe, you may see a Tweet from a customer who has a question about
   your hours. Or, if you’re a boutique owner, you might see a Tweet from
   a potential customer talking about one of your products. The ability to
   see these Tweets at a glance offers endless opportunities for you to
   connect with customers and potential customers with responses that add
   value.

   Introducing Twitter Dashboard

   Tweet when the time is right
   Now you can schedule Tweets to reach your audience when they’re online
   and you’re busy doing other things. If you want to edit your scheduled
   Tweets while you’re on the go, you can use the iOS Dashboard app to
   update your Tweet queue.

   Introducing Twitter Dashboard

   Get Tweet ideas and inspiration
   Kickstart your creative process with Tweet tips geared just for
   businesses. They can help you start conversations and engage your
   audience in those moments when you’re not sure what to Tweet. For
   example, if you work at a restaurant, a tip like, “Your team is as
   unique as your business. Tweet a surprising fact about one of your team
   members,” might remind you to share some recent recognition your chef
   received. Or, if you’re an interior designer, seeing, “Share the love.
   Like and Retweet kind words from your customers,” might prompt you to
   Retweet a customer’s excited reaction to one of your recent projects.

   Introducing Twitter Dashboard

   We’ve heard from businesses about how they plan to integrate Twitter
   Dashboard into their marketing strategy:

     Being able to easily schedule Tweets and manage my queue with
     Twitter Dashboard is critical to staying on track with our
     engagement campaigns on Twitter.
     Logan Robinson, Social Media Manager@GarnetandGold

     From our first use we could tell Twitter Dashboard would become an
     essential tool for our business. Not only is scheduling Tweets now a
     seamless experience, but having access to a custom timeline is
     helping us identify the best opportunities to engage with our
     customers and potential customers on Twitter.
     Jeff Kitchen, Online Community Manager@Crutchfield

   Get started
   The Twitter Dashboard beta is available to all US-based businesses
   today. Go to dashboard.twitter.com or download Dashboard in the App
   Store.

Information operations directed at Hong Kong

   By Twitter Safety
   Monday, 19 August 2019
   Link copied successfully

   We are disclosing a significant state-backed information operation
   focused on the situation in Hong Kong, specifically the protest
   movement and their calls for political change.
   What we are disclosing
   This disclosure consists of 936 accounts originating from within the
   People’s Republic of China (PRC). Overall, these accounts were
   deliberately and specifically attempting to sow political discord in
   Hong Kong, including undermining the legitimacy and political positions
   of the protest movement on the ground. Based on our intensive
   investigations, we have reliable evidence to support that this is a
   coordinated state-backed operation. Specifically, we identified large
   clusters of accounts behaving in a coordinated manner to amplify
   messages related to the Hong Kong protests.

   As Twitter is blocked in PRC, many of these accounts accessed Twitter
   using VPNs. However, some accounts accessed Twitter from specific
   unblocked IP addresses originating in mainland China. The accounts we
   are sharing today represent the most active portions of this campaign;
   a larger, spammy network of approximately 200,000 accounts — many
   created following our initial suspensions — were proactively suspended
   before they were substantially active on the service.

   All the accounts have been suspended for a range of violations of our
   platform manipulation policies, which we define as:
     * Spam
     * Coordinated activity
     * Fake accounts
     * Attributed activity
     * Ban evasion

   Examples of violative content

   [xHrnqf1T_normal.jpg]

   Next steps
   Covert, manipulative behaviors have no place on our service — they
   violate the fundamental principles on which our company is built. As we
   have said before, it is clear that information operations and
   coordinated inauthentic behavior will not cease. These deceptive
   strategies have been around for far longer than Twitter has existed.
   They adapt and change as the geopolitical terrain evolves worldwide and
   as new technologies emerge. For our part, we are committed to
   understanding and combating how bad-faith actors use our services.
   Today we are adding archives containing complete Tweet and user
   information for the 936 accounts we’ve disclosed to our archive of
   information operations — the largest of its kind in the industry.
   We will continue to be vigilant, learning from this network and
   proactively enforcing our policies to serve the public conversation. We
   hope that by being transparent and open we will empower further
   learning and public understanding of these nefarious tactics. You can
   access relevant account and Tweet information on our dedicated Election
   Integrity Hub.

   Note: We have divided these archives into two parts to better enable
   review of the intersecting networks of accounts which comprise this
   campaign. We have evidence to indicate that both sets are associated
   with the same entity.

Tips

Automation and the use of multiple accounts

   By Yoel Roth
   Wednesday, 21 February 2018
   Link copied successfully

   Keeping Twitter safe and free from spam is a top priority for us. One
   of the most common spam violations we see is the use of multiple
   accounts and the Twitter developer platform to attempt to artificially
   amplify or inflate the prominence of certain Tweets. To be clear:
   Twitter prohibits any attempt to use automation for the purposes of
   posting or disseminating spam, and such behavior may result in
   enforcement action.

   In January, we announced that as part of our Information Quality
   efforts we would be making changes to TweetDeck and the Twitter API to
   limit the ability of users to perform coordinated actions across
   multiple accounts. These changes are an important step in ensuring we
   stay ahead of malicious activity targeting the crucial conversations
   taking place on Twitter — including elections in the United States and
   around the world. Today, we’re sharing details about those changes, as
   well as important guidance for developers on how to comply with these
   rules.

   Please review this guidance carefully, as you may be required to make
   changes to your application or service.

   Do not (and do not allow your users to) simultaneously post identical
   or substantially similar content to multiple accounts. For example,
   your service should not permit a user to select several accounts they
   control from which to publish a given Tweet.
     * This applies regardless of whether the Tweets are published to
       Twitter at the same time, or are scheduled/queued for future
       publication.
     * As an alternative to posting identical content, you can Retweet
       content from one account from the other accounts you wish to share
       that post from. This should only be done from a small number of
       distinct accounts that you directly control. Please note that bulk,
       aggressive, or very high-volume automated Retweeting is not
       permitted under the Automation Rules, and may be subject to
       enforcement actions.

   Do not (and do not allow your users to) simultaneously perform actions
   such as Likes, Retweets, or follows from multiple accounts. For
   example, your service should not permit a user to select several
   accounts they control to follow a specified account.
     * For additional information on aggressive or inorganic following
       behavior, please refer to this developer forum post.
     * For additional information on the appropriate use of automation for
       replies and mentions, please refer to this developer forum post.

   The use of any form of automation (including scheduling) to post
   identical or substantially similar content, or to perform actions such
   as Likes or Retweets, across many accounts that have authorized your
   app (whether or not you created or directly control those accounts) is
   not permitted. For example, applications that coordinate activity
   across multiple accounts to simultaneously post Tweets with a specific
   hashtag (e.g. in an attempt to cause that topic to trend) are
   prohibited.
     * While we continue to permit cross-posting outside information (such
       as weather alerts or RSS feeds) to Twitter using automation, you
       should only post this content to one account you control.
     * As a sole exception to this rule, applications that broadcast or
       share weather, emergency, or other public service announcements of
       broad community interest (for example, earthquake or tsunami
       alerts) are permitted to post this content across multiple accounts
       who have authorized an app.

   Today, we’re also introducing changes to TweetDeck’s multiple account
   functionality to reflect this guidance. Users of TweetDeck will no
   longer be able to select multiple accounts through which to perform an
   action such as Tweeting, Retweeting, liking, or following.

   If your app or service includes features which allow users to perform
   simultaneous actions across multiple accounts, you should make changes
   to bring it into compliance with this policy by March 23, 2018. Failure
   to comply with these rules could result in enforcement action, up to
   and including the suspension of associated applications and accounts.

   While we provide detailed definitions of what constitutes spam in the
   Twitter Rules and Automation Rules, you should keep these two policies
   front of mind whenever you use the Twitter API to publish, share, or
   engage with content on Twitter:
     * Posting duplicative or substantially similar content, replies, or
       mentions over multiple accounts you control, or creating duplicate
       or substantially similar accounts, with or without the use of
       automation, is never allowed.
     * Posting multiple updates (on a single account or across multiple
       accounts you control) to a trending or popular topic (for instance,
       through the use of a specific hashtag) with an intent to subvert or
       manipulate the topic, or to artificially inflate the prominence of
       a hashtag or topic, is never allowed.

   You can ask questions about any of our developer policies, and
   specifically about this clarification, using the Rules and Policies
   category in the Developer Forums.

An easier way to save and share Tweets

   By Jesar Shah
   Wednesday, 28 February 2018
   Link copied successfully

   From articles and threads to videos and GIFs, timelines are packed with
   Tweets that you don't always have time to fully explore in the moment.
   You’ve told us you want to save them for later.

   Hello, Bookmarks!

   Today, we’re introducing Bookmarks, an easy way to save Tweets for
   quick access later. But wait, there’s more! Today’s update makes
   sharing better, too. With our new “share” icon on every Tweet, you’ll
   be able to bookmark a Tweet, share via Direct Message, or share off of
   Twitter any number of ways. Because we put all sharing actions together
   in one place, it’s easier to save and share privately or publicly — in
   the moment, or later.

   How It Works

   To bookmark a Tweet, tap the share icon under the Tweet and select,
   “Add Tweet to Bookmarks”. To find it later, tap “Bookmarks” from your
   profile icon menu. You can remove Tweets from your Bookmarks at any
   time. Also, only you can see what you’ve bookmarked. Learn more about
   how to bookmark in our Help Center.

   Bookmarks help people keep up with the best of Twitter. You can save a
   Tweet with a live morning show like Buzzfeed’s #AM2DM to watch at
   another time, bookmark a thread from @Lin_Manuel about new Hamilton
   music to come back to, and save Tweets with links to interesting
   articles for later reading or sharing. You’ll no doubt show us more
   creative uses for Bookmarks than we ever imagined! (You have a tendency
   to do that on Twitter.)

   Better Because of Your Feedback

   We Tweeted ongoing updates as we built Bookmarks so we could
   incorporate your input as we worked. By working this way, we learned
   that you like to save replies so you can answer later and that you may
   share a Tweet hours or days later after you’ve bookmarked it. Thank you
   for being part of this process — your feedback was valuable in building
   this update, and it made it all the more fun for us as we built a new
   feature for you. As a result, we all have an easier way to save, share,
   and stay informed.

   Bookmarks are now rolling out globally on Twitter for iOS and Android,
   Twitter Lite, and mobile.twitter.com. Thanks for your collaboration to
   make Bookmarks happen. Happy bookmarking!

Tweeting Made Easier

   By Aliza Rosen
   Tuesday, 7 November 2017
   Link copied successfully

   In September, we launched a test that expanded the 140 character limit
   so every person around the world could express themselves easily in a
   Tweet. Our goal was to make this possible while ensuring we keep the
   speed and brevity that makes Twitter, Twitter. Looking at all the data,
   we’re excited to share we’ve achieved this goal and are rolling the
   change out to all languages where cramming was an issue.*

   During the first few days of the test many people Tweeted the full 280
   limit because it was new and novel, but soon after behavior normalized
   (more on this below). We saw when people needed to use more than 140
   characters, they Tweeted more easily and more often. But importantly,
   people Tweeted below 140 most of the time and the brevity of Twitter
   remained.

   Highlights are below and in our additional blogs about our
   experimentation process, extensive data analysis, research, and design
   work.

   Easier to Tweet

   Historically, 9% of Tweets in English hit the character limit. This
   reflects the challenge of fitting a thought into a Tweet, often
   resulting in lots of time spent editing and even at times abandoning
   Tweets before sending. With the expanded character count, this problem
   was massively reduced – that number dropped to only 1% of Tweets
   running up against the limit. Since we saw Tweets hit the character
   limit less often, we believe people spent less time editing their
   Tweets in the composer. This shows that more space makes it easier for
   people to fit thoughts in a Tweet, so they could say what they want to
   say, and send Tweets faster than before. You can see this happening in
   the graph below.

   Keeping Twitter’s brevity

   We – and many of you – were concerned that timelines may fill up with
   280 character Tweets, and people with the new limit would always use up
   the whole space. But that didn’t happen. Only 5% of Tweets sent were
   longer than 140 characters and only 2% were over 190 characters. As a
   result, your timeline reading experience should not substantially
   change, you’ll still see about the same amount of Tweets in your
   timeline. For reference, in the timeline, Tweets with an image or poll
   usually take up more space than a 190 character Tweet.

   It’s worth emphasizing again that people in the test got very excited
   about the extra space in the beginning and many Tweets went way beyond
   140. People did silly (creative!) things like writing just a few
   characters per line to make their Tweets extra large. It was a
   temporary effect and didn’t last long. We expect to see some of this
   novelty effect spike again with this week’s launch and expect it to
   resume to normal behavior soon after.

   Engagement

   In addition to more Tweeting, people who had more room to Tweet
   received more engagement (Likes, Retweets, @mentions), got more
   followers, and spent more time on Twitter. People in the experiment
   told us that a higher character limit made them feel more satisfied
   with how they expressed themselves on Twitter, their ability to find
   good content, and Twitter overall.

   We are making this change after listening and observing a problem our
   global community was having (it wasn’t easy enough to Tweet!), studying
   data to understand how we could improve, trying it out, and listening
   to your feedback. We’ll continue listening and working to make Twitter
   easier for everyone while making sure we keep what you love.

   *Japanese, Korean, and Chinese will continue to have 140 characters
   because cramming is not an issue in these languages. In fact, these
   languages have always been able to say more with their Tweets because
   of the density of their writing systems. We shared more about this
   thinking and our research here.

   **On this graph, there is a small bump in the red line (which
   represents the group with 280 characters) at 140 because these people
   were also using older Twitter clients which didn’t have the ability to
   send longer Tweets, so they continued to hit the 140 character limit.
   This graph is for English-only Tweets.

Introducing Twitter Dashboard

   By �@noahmp�
   Tuesday, 28 June 2016
   Link copied successfully

   For businesses, Twitter is a place to share news, tell stories, and
   have conversations that support, educate, and delight their customers.
   It’s a place for authentic interactions – but we know that creating
   these kinds of connections isn’t always easy for businesses that are
   time and resource-constrained. That’s why we built a brand new app to
   help the busy people behind these businesses. Introducing: Twitter
   Dashboard.

   Twitter Dashboard is a powerful tool designed to help businesses
   connect with their customers and community. Large, dedicated teams
   typically have the advantage of sophisticated tools provided by Twitter
   ecosystem partners. Today we’re offering a free tool to give all
   businesses an advantage in the way they use Twitter. With an iOS app
   and desktop web experience, Dashboard offers a single destination to
   get things done. It gives business owners a clear picture of what’s
   being said about their businesses, lets them schedule Tweets, and
   offers insights about their Tweet performance.

   Dashboard can help you:

   Easily engage with your audience
   Create a custom feed to find out what’s being said about your business.
   (Chances are there’s more than the mentions you’d normally be notified
   about!) Use your custom feed to get right to the Tweets you want to see
   first and better engage with your community. For example, if you work
   at a cafe, you may see a Tweet from a customer who has a question about
   your hours. Or, if you’re a boutique owner, you might see a Tweet from
   a potential customer talking about one of your products. The ability to
   see these Tweets at a glance offers endless opportunities for you to
   connect with customers and potential customers with responses that add
   value.

   Introducing Twitter Dashboard

   Tweet when the time is right
   Now you can schedule Tweets to reach your audience when they’re online
   and you’re busy doing other things. If you want to edit your scheduled
   Tweets while you’re on the go, you can use the iOS Dashboard app to
   update your Tweet queue.

   Introducing Twitter Dashboard

   Get Tweet ideas and inspiration
   Kickstart your creative process with Tweet tips geared just for
   businesses. They can help you start conversations and engage your
   audience in those moments when you’re not sure what to Tweet. For
   example, if you work at a restaurant, a tip like, “Your team is as
   unique as your business. Tweet a surprising fact about one of your team
   members,” might remind you to share some recent recognition your chef
   received. Or, if you’re an interior designer, seeing, “Share the love.
   Like and Retweet kind words from your customers,” might prompt you to
   Retweet a customer’s excited reaction to one of your recent projects.

   Introducing Twitter Dashboard

   We’ve heard from businesses about how they plan to integrate Twitter
   Dashboard into their marketing strategy:

     Being able to easily schedule Tweets and manage my queue with
     Twitter Dashboard is critical to staying on track with our
     engagement campaigns on Twitter.
     Logan Robinson, Social Media Manager@GarnetandGold

     From our first use we could tell Twitter Dashboard would become an
     essential tool for our business. Not only is scheduling Tweets now a
     seamless experience, but having access to a custom timeline is
     helping us identify the best opportunities to engage with our
     customers and potential customers on Twitter.
     Jeff Kitchen, Online Community Manager@Crutchfield

   Get started
   The Twitter Dashboard beta is available to all US-based businesses
   today. Go to dashboard.twitter.com or download Dashboard in the App
   Store.

Les "Questions" Twitter arrivent en France

   Par �@tdd�
   mercredi, 21 octobre 2015
   Le lien a bien été copié

   Nous avons le plaisir de vous annoncer la disponibilité des Questions
   Twitter en France. D’ici quelques jours et en quelques clics, les
   utilisateurs pourront interroger leurs followers sur les sujets qui
   leur tiennent à cœur.

   Il n’existe pas de meilleure plateforme que Twitter pour obtenir des
   réponses instantanées et sur mesure. Choisissez ce sur quoi vous
   souhaitez interroger votre communauté, par exemple : comment appeler
   votre chien? qui va gagner le match de ce soir? quel sujet politique
   les intéresse le plus?

     https://twitter.com/TwitterFrance/status/656835648943316993

   Pour tous les utilisateurs de Twitter, c’est une nouvelle manière de
   s’engager auprès de sa communauté et de comprendre précisément les
   attentes ou l’opinion du public. Et pour les participants, c’est une
   façon très simple de se faire entendre en toute anonymat.

   Auparavant, il était déjà possible de poser des questions sur Twitter
   de différentes manières - Tweeter des questions et suivre les réponses,
   faire un décompte d’utilisation de hashtags de vote, ou demander aux
   utilisateurs de mettre en favoris vs. Retweeter pour donner leur
   opinion. Bientôt, vous pourrez créer votre propre Question à double
   choix, directement depuis une fenêtre dédiée, et celle-ci sera
   disponible en ligne pendant 24 heures. Vous pourrez également donner
   votre opinion en toute confidentialité sur les Questions des autres
   utilisateurs.

   Les "Questions" Twitter arrivent en France

   Au cours des prochains jours, nous vous permettrons de créer une
   Question sur iOs, Android, et sur Twitter.com, grâce une icône dédiée
   en bas de votre écran.
     __________________________________________________________________

   MISE A JOUR : Vous pouvez maintenant proposer jusqu’à 4 options de
   réponses à une Questions Twitter.

An easier way to save and share Tweets

   By Jesar Shah
   Wednesday, 28 February 2018
   Link copied successfully

   From articles and threads to videos and GIFs, timelines are packed with
   Tweets that you don't always have time to fully explore in the moment.
   You’ve told us you want to save them for later.

   Hello, Bookmarks!

   Today, we’re introducing Bookmarks, an easy way to save Tweets for
   quick access later. But wait, there’s more! Today’s update makes
   sharing better, too. With our new “share” icon on every Tweet, you’ll
   be able to bookmark a Tweet, share via Direct Message, or share off of
   Twitter any number of ways. Because we put all sharing actions together
   in one place, it’s easier to save and share privately or publicly — in
   the moment, or later.

   How It Works

   To bookmark a Tweet, tap the share icon under the Tweet and select,
   “Add Tweet to Bookmarks”. To find it later, tap “Bookmarks” from your
   profile icon menu. You can remove Tweets from your Bookmarks at any
   time. Also, only you can see what you’ve bookmarked. Learn more about
   how to bookmark in our Help Center.

   Bookmarks help people keep up with the best of Twitter. You can save a
   Tweet with a live morning show like Buzzfeed’s #AM2DM to watch at
   another time, bookmark a thread from @Lin_Manuel about new Hamilton
   music to come back to, and save Tweets with links to interesting
   articles for later reading or sharing. You’ll no doubt show us more
   creative uses for Bookmarks than we ever imagined! (You have a tendency
   to do that on Twitter.)

   Better Because of Your Feedback

   We Tweeted ongoing updates as we built Bookmarks so we could
   incorporate your input as we worked. By working this way, we learned
   that you like to save replies so you can answer later and that you may
   share a Tweet hours or days later after you’ve bookmarked it. Thank you
   for being part of this process — your feedback was valuable in building
   this update, and it made it all the more fun for us as we built a new
   feature for you. As a result, we all have an easier way to save, share,
   and stay informed.

   Bookmarks are now rolling out globally on Twitter for iOS and Android,
   Twitter Lite, and mobile.twitter.com. Thanks for your collaboration to
   make Bookmarks happen. Happy bookmarking!

Tweeting Made Easier

   By Aliza Rosen
   Tuesday, 7 November 2017
   Link copied successfully

   In September, we launched a test that expanded the 140 character limit
   so every person around the world could express themselves easily in a
   Tweet. Our goal was to make this possible while ensuring we keep the
   speed and brevity that makes Twitter, Twitter. Looking at all the data,
   we’re excited to share we’ve achieved this goal and are rolling the
   change out to all languages where cramming was an issue.*

   During the first few days of the test many people Tweeted the full 280
   limit because it was new and novel, but soon after behavior normalized
   (more on this below). We saw when people needed to use more than 140
   characters, they Tweeted more easily and more often. But importantly,
   people Tweeted below 140 most of the time and the brevity of Twitter
   remained.

   Highlights are below and in our additional blogs about our
   experimentation process, extensive data analysis, research, and design
   work.

   Easier to Tweet

   Historically, 9% of Tweets in English hit the character limit. This
   reflects the challenge of fitting a thought into a Tweet, often
   resulting in lots of time spent editing and even at times abandoning
   Tweets before sending. With the expanded character count, this problem
   was massively reduced – that number dropped to only 1% of Tweets
   running up against the limit. Since we saw Tweets hit the character
   limit less often, we believe people spent less time editing their
   Tweets in the composer. This shows that more space makes it easier for
   people to fit thoughts in a Tweet, so they could say what they want to
   say, and send Tweets faster than before. You can see this happening in
   the graph below.

   Keeping Twitter’s brevity

   We – and many of you – were concerned that timelines may fill up with
   280 character Tweets, and people with the new limit would always use up
   the whole space. But that didn’t happen. Only 5% of Tweets sent were
   longer than 140 characters and only 2% were over 190 characters. As a
   result, your timeline reading experience should not substantially
   change, you’ll still see about the same amount of Tweets in your
   timeline. For reference, in the timeline, Tweets with an image or poll
   usually take up more space than a 190 character Tweet.

   It’s worth emphasizing again that people in the test got very excited
   about the extra space in the beginning and many Tweets went way beyond
   140. People did silly (creative!) things like writing just a few
   characters per line to make their Tweets extra large. It was a
   temporary effect and didn’t last long. We expect to see some of this
   novelty effect spike again with this week’s launch and expect it to
   resume to normal behavior soon after.

   Engagement

   In addition to more Tweeting, people who had more room to Tweet
   received more engagement (Likes, Retweets, @mentions), got more
   followers, and spent more time on Twitter. People in the experiment
   told us that a higher character limit made them feel more satisfied
   with how they expressed themselves on Twitter, their ability to find
   good content, and Twitter overall.

   We are making this change after listening and observing a problem our
   global community was having (it wasn’t easy enough to Tweet!), studying
   data to understand how we could improve, trying it out, and listening
   to your feedback. We’ll continue listening and working to make Twitter
   easier for everyone while making sure we keep what you love.

   *Japanese, Korean, and Chinese will continue to have 140 characters
   because cramming is not an issue in these languages. In fact, these
   languages have always been able to say more with their Tweets because
   of the density of their writing systems. We shared more about this
   thinking and our research here.

   **On this graph, there is a small bump in the red line (which
   represents the group with 280 characters) at 140 because these people
   were also using older Twitter clients which didn’t have the ability to
   send longer Tweets, so they continued to hit the 140 character limit.
   This graph is for English-only Tweets.
