   In addition to all of the things the Joker publicity cycle has assured
   us Todd Phillips’ Batman-adjacent Scorsese riff is not—not an
   incitement to violence, not an endorsement of its main character’s
   actions, not subject to questions from red-carpet interviewers—there’s
   also this: Despite telling the story of an aspiring comedian who
   becomes an unhinged murder-clown, it’s not a canonical origin story.
   Joker has no connection to any ongoing onscreen saga set in Gotham
   City; Joaquin Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck will not go on to become Jack
   Nicholson’s purring hood Jack Napier, the agent of chaos that earned
   Heath Ledger a posthumous Oscar, or the chrome-grilled edge lord who
   stamped “damaged” on his forehead for Suicide Squad. Rather, he’s
   another voice in a giggling gestalt that has beguiled, tickled, and
   terrified audiences and creators ever since Jerry Robinson first laid
   down a sketch of a Joker card with crimson lips and a fearsome smile.
   The Joker, like his crime-fighting other half, isn’t a fixed idea but
   an ever-evolving archetype: the comical disguise Cesar Romero could don
   without shaving, the lanky killer of ’70s Batman comics, the villain
   who got Mark Hamill to give into the dark side.

   As such, there’s not really anything you need to know about the
   character before seeing the first movie to ever put his name in the
   title. (Because let’s be straight here: This is far from the first time
   the Joker has ever headlined a movie.) But ahead of Joker, you might be
   wondering: What’s the deal with this clown, and why do we keep telling
   stories about him? Without delving too deeply into the obvious—in 2019,
   nobody needs to be out here championing the Tim Burton Batman, The Dark
   Knight, The Killing Joke, or The Dark Knight Returns (though, if you
   haven’t seen or read those, you really should)—perhaps the following
   recommendations can offer some insight. And if they don’t, maybe you
   need to ask yourself another question: Why so serious?
     __________________________________________________________________

Batman, “Surf’s Up! Joker’s Under!” (1968)

   Cesar Romero romanced Betty Grable and saved the day as the Cisco Kid
   before painting over his signature mustache in the role he’d be best
   remembered for: Scuffling with Adam West and Burt Ward in 22 episodes
   of the ’60s live-action Batman series (and its big-screen spin-off).
   Each of those appearances were memorable, but from a simply bizarre
   (and beachy) perspective, one stands out: Season three’s “Surf’s Up!
   Joker’s Under!” At the time, the surfing craze had engulfed so much of
   popular culture that even the Joker was trying to win over the kids at
   Gotham Point by catching a wave in a contest against his arch nemesis.
   It’s largely an excuse for the Batman cast (including Batgirl!) to trot
   out slang like “island pullout” and “cowabunga,” but Joker (and Batman,
   for that matter) have never looked more ridiculous than wearing their
   “baggies” in front of an obvious rear-projection setup. Naturally,
   Batman is the eventual winner, due to the timely use of his Bat-Shark
   Repellant, and the indefatigable Joker is defeated yet again. Romero’s
   campy portrayal may have been the most benign of all Jokers, but he was
   also a hell of a lot of fun. [Gwen Ihnat]

A Death In The Family (1988)

   (BUTTON) (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   Jim Starlin and Jim Aparo’s A Death In The Family is famous as the
   story where the Joker captures and brutally tortures Jason Todd, the
   second Robin, before leaving him to die in an explosion. That’s the
   part everyone knows, but the Joker’s scheme goes completely off the
   wall in the final act. See, Jason got captured while he and Batman were
   investigating the Joker’s attempt to sell a nuclear weapon to Iran
   (this was the ’80s, after all), and Ayatollah Khomeini is so pleased
   with what the Joker is offering that he names the Clown Prince of Crime
   as his country’s representative to the United Nations and sends him to
   make a speech at the General Assembly in New York City—with the U.S.
   government actually using Superman to stop Batman from doing anything
   in hopes of avoiding an international incident. The speech turns out to
   be a sham and the Joker tries to kill everyone, obviously, giving
   Batman and Superman a chance to beat him up. Later, in a fit of grief
   over Jason’s death, Batman even allows the Joker to nearly get killed
   in a helicopter crash (though he somehow escapes unharmed). [Sam
   Barsanti]

Batman: The Animated Series, “The Laughing Fish” (1993)

   This one’s a threefer, the plots of two legendary comics—“The Joker’s
   Five-Way Revenge” and “The Laughing Fish,” each from a separate,
   legendary run in Batman’s flagship titles—synthesized by the TV series
   that dared to challenge Jack Nicholson for the title of definitive
   onscreen Joker a scant three years after his dance with the devil in
   the pale moon light. It could be a hybrid that looks as unnatural or
   unsightly as the episode’s smiling catch of the day, a televised
   cartoon recreating source material where the Joker bumps off innocent
   copyright clerks and attempts to feed an old man to a shark. This
   “Laughing Fish” hangs together thanks to the fact that those
   comics—widely credited with restoring the Joker’s sense of murderous
   menace (and in the case of Neal Adams and Denny O’Neil’s “Five-Way
   Revenge,” restoring the character’s presence on the comics page,
   period)—begin and end with some toothy sea creatures; it also helps
   that two of the driving forces behind Batman: The Animated, Bruce Timm
   and Paul Dini, are there to guide the episode along the razor’s edge.
   But the most important name in the credits is Mark Hamill, whose crazed
   carnival barker approach to the Joker projects a threat (his cackling
   entrance is just aces) even as the character dons an angler’s cap,
   signals to henchman with a whoopee cushion, and interrupts regularly
   scheduled programming to plug the seafood he’s rendered in his image
   for seemingly arbitrary reasons. Leave it to the Joker to render
   trademark registration into rip-roaring superhero action. [Erik Adams]

Batman Beyond: Return Of The Joker (2000)

   The slick cyberpunk series Batman Beyond acts as a continuation of
   Batman: The Animated Series and The New Batman Adventures, introducing
   viewers to a new Batman—the 16-year-old Terry McGinnis—and a new
   setting—Neo-Gotham in 2039. Beyond also abandoned most of Batman’s
   classic rogues gallery, the most notable exception being the
   direct-to-video feature, Return Of The Joker, released during the
   show’s third and final season. Return Of The Joker marked the first and
   only appearance of the original Clown Prince of Crime in the Beyond
   universe—until that point in the series, he was only referenced through
   the amateurish, Juggalo-looking street gang The Jokerz, who terrorized
   Neo-Gotham in his name. The film opens with the mysterious reappearance
   of The Joker (voiced by a returning Mark Hamill), who was presumed dead
   after an encounter with the original Batman. Without giving too much
   away, what follows is an intriguing expansion of the mythos surrounding
   Hamill’s Joker that occasionally drifts into unsettling territory—one
   scene in particular, a flashback involving the Joker and Batman’s
   former protégé Tim Drake, is genuinely disturbing. In fact, there was
   so much concern over Return Of The Joker’s imagery in the wake of the
   Columbine massacre, Warner Bros. Animation re-edited the film prior to
   its release. The “uncut” version was released on DVD shortly
   thereafter, and is now widely available. [Baraka Kaseko]

Batman #663, “The Clown At Midnight” (2010)

   Advertisement
   (BUTTON) (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   Few comic authors of the modern era have spent more time or energy on
   the question of what—not who—the Joker really is than Grant Morrison,
   whose character-redefining run on Batman in the late 2000s always
   seemed to circle back somehow to the Thin White Duke of Death. That
   tendency expresses itself most clearly in the prose-only “The Clown At
   Midnight,” in which the Joker methodically, and brutally, kills off all
   of his former henchman in an effort to wipe the slate clean and ready
   himself to become the next, even more monstrous version of his numerous
   personas. Morrison’s Batman run frequently falls back on the idea that
   every weird, nonsensical, magical, or science-fiction adventure that
   Batman engaged in back in the Silver Age really happened, in some form
   or another. “The Clown At Midnight” similarly argues that every Joker
   is the essential Joker, from the boner-spouting goofball of the “Satire
   Years,” to the cold-blooded killer of the New Homicidal, or the
   gleefully smiling clown of the Camp. (Those are all Mistah J’s terms,
   not ours.) In Morrison’s conception, the Joker is simply the ultimate
   survivor, “shuffling selves like a croupier deals cards, to buffer the
   shocks and work some alchemy that might just turn the lead of tragedy
   and horror into into the fierce, chaotic gold of the laughter of the
   damned.” Or, as Morrison also can’t help but note: Maybe he’s just
   nuts. [William Hughes]

Batman: Under The Red Hood (2010)

   Jason Todd’s blood may have been on the Joker’s hands, but it was
   really the majority of Batman readers who (narrowly) killed the second
   Boy Wonder in 1988. But just like in soap operas, popular comics
   characters rarely stay dead forever, and Jason eventually returned,
   first in the “Under The Hood” storyline that ran from 2004 to 2006, and
   then an excellent direct-to-video movie in 2010. The movie reveals that
   after Joker beat Robin with a crowbar and blew him up in a warehouse,
   Ra’s al Ghul swiped Jason’s body and revived him in the Lazarus Pit.
   Jason grows up to be a crime boss known as the Red Hood (an alias that
   factors into the Joker’s classic origin story), but his biggest beef
   with Batman is the same as many of ours: Why is Joker still alive?
   Jensen Ackles impressively captures Jason’s combined rage and grief as
   he protests: “If it had been you that he beat to a bloody pulp, if he
   had taken you from this world, I would’ve done nothing but search the
   planet for this pathetic pile of evil, death-worshiping garbage and
   then send him off to hell!” Although Joker basically functions as a
   pawn here in the battle between Jason and his former mentor, Under The
   Red Hood uncovers the truth of Batman’s eternal moral quandary. Voiced
   by Bruce Greenwood, Batman painfully admits as much to Jason: He thinks
   about killing Joker every day, but once he started killing, he’d never
   stop, and his battle over the darkness in his own soul would be lost:
   “If I allow myself to go down into that place… I’ll never come back.”
   So Joker survives, continuing to torment Batman as long as the Caped
   Crusader exists. [Gwen Ihnat]

Endgame (2012)

   Illustration for article titled A deck of Jokers: Going deeper with The
   Clown Prince Of Crime
   Screenshot: Engame

   A lot of Joker stories are about his perception of the relationship he
   has with Batman, like The Dark Knight’s “you complete me” speech, but
   Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo’s Endgame story arc is an inversion of
   that. After years of trying to convince Batman that they’re essentially
   soulmates, the Joker is done. He just wants Batman to die. To do that,
   he releases a gas in Gotham that forces everyone (including the Justice
   League) to try and kill their loved ones. As he searches for a cure,
   Batman realizes that an Arkham orderly named Eric Border (who had been
   in Batman comics for a year or so) was actually the Joker in disguise,
   and he finds seemingly definitive proof that Joker is actually
   immortal. It’s more complicated than that, but the story ends with both
   Joker and Batman seemingly dying when an underground cave collapses on
   them. Make sure to stick around for the next story arc, where an
   amnesiac Bruce Wayne meets a somewhat “cured” Joker who is trying to
   live an honest life and pleads with him to never put on the cape and
   cowl again—because he’s afraid of what he’ll become if Batman returns.

Batman: Arkham Knight (2015)

   Advertisement
   (BUTTON) (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   Mark Hamill’s definitive vocal take on the Joker rarely got a better
   chance to shine than in Rocksteady’s trilogy of Batman-based Arkham
   games, where—dead, or alive—the Joker always seemed to somehow get the
   last laugh. Nowhere was that clearer than in 2015’s big finale to the
   series, Arkham Knight, where Hamill’s drolly cackling supercriminal
   refuses to let a silly little thing like dying at the end of the
   previous game get in the way of spreading some of his signature mirth.
   The game’s most brilliant twist—empowered by a dose of fear toxin from
   its ostensible “main” villain, Scarecrow—places Hamill’s Joker as the
   intangible, constantly snarking devil on Bruce Wayne’s shoulder,
   driving him deeper and deeper into green-eyed madness as the night
   wears on. Hamill has always been the funniest of the Jokers, but he
   really gets a chance to shine here, laying down one-liner after
   one-liner that only his increasingly harried “buddy” can hear. At the
   same time, he gleefully leans into the series’ vision of the Joker’s
   most terrifying trait: Not what he’s done to people, or what he will
   do. Rather, it’s the madness he represents, always looming and
   threatening to eat away at the mind of a hero who often seems like he
   might be one bad night away from finally getting the joke. [William
   Hughes]

   [avclub-saturated.png] Age Of HeroesWith Age Of Heroes, Tom Breihan
   picks the most important superhero movie of every year, starting with
   the genre’s early big-budget moments and moving onto the
   multiplex-crushing monsters of today.

   Midway through Christopher Nolan’s 2008 movie The Dark Knight, the
   Joker gets himself arrested so that he can then break out of his
   holding cell and continue his grand experiment in human darkness. While
   he’s locked up, he’s placed in the custody of the Major Crimes Unit,
   the police force that’s supposedly been devoted to locking up Batman.
   In the movie, people keep referring to the Major Crimes Unit as the
   MCU. As in: “There’s a problem at the MCU!” Watching it today, you
   might hurt your neck doing double-takes at those initials every time.
   The Dark Knight, as it happens, came out at the last moment that “MCU”
   could possibly refer to anything related to Batman.

   Today, of course, we know the MCU as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the
   steamrolling blockbuster-generating engine that has become the dominant
   commercial force in all of moviemaking. It was never a given that the
   Marvel Cinematic Universe would work. By the time the people at Marvel
   got around to establishing their own movie studio, they’d already sold
   off the rights to many of their most-famous characters: Spider-Man, the
   X-Men, the Fantastic Four. Only the relative dregs were left over, and
   nobody knew whether a relatively minor character like Iron Man could
   anchor a whole movie, let alone a franchise. It was a gamble.

   It was a gamble, too, to cast Robert Downey Jr., a faded star who’d
   spent years battling his personal demons. It was a gamble to go against
   the sober, contemplative tone of superhero movies like Batman Begins or
   Superman Returns. Marvel instead found a light, quippy aesthetic—one
   that acknowledged the absurdity of the whole enterprise while still
   allowing for genuine adventure-serial thrills. (The Incredible Hulk,
   the second Marvel Cinematic Universe film, which came out a month
   before The Dark Knight, marked an altogether-unsuccessful reversion to
   that serious, heavy style.) The Iron Man gamble paid off spectacularly,
   many times over.

   Iron Man wasn’t just a hit, and it wasn’t just a tremendously
   entertaining movie. It was the foundation upon which an entire movie
   institution was built. More than a decade later, Marvel is still
   running with that tone and that aesthetic, and it is utterly dominating
   everything else in Hollywood. Rewatching Iron Man today, it’s
   remarkable how much of what would later power the whole franchise is
   already there: S.H.I.E.L.D, Agent Coulson, Downey’s nonstop smirky
   patter, Tony Stark’s unfortunate tendency to power up his own enemies,
   the soothing robot voice that Paul Bettany adopted years before he
   found himself painted red and green. (It’s also a more intense movie
   than you might remember. I tried to show it to my kids, and they were
   done as soon as the missiles hit the convoy.) And with that famous Iron
   Man post-credits scene, Marvel set up a dizzying array of future-movie
   possibilities. And then it somehow made good on those possibilities.
   That’s amazing.

   Iron Man’s importance, both to superhero movies and to cinema in
   general, cannot be overstated. And yet Iron Man was not the most
   important superhero movie of 2008. That distinction belongs to The Dark
   Knight, which was a genuine cultural phenomenon and which changed the
   way the public at large saw superheroes in the same way that Jaws
   changed sharks or Star Wars changed spaceships. Before The Dark Knight,
   superhero movies made money, but they were a sideshow. The Dark Knight
   made money, too; it was the highest-grossing movie of 2008. But it
   didn’t just make money. It was, in its moment, widely hailed as
   something resembling a masterpiece. When, for instance, the Academy Of
   Motion Picture Arts And Sciences failed to nominate The Dark Knight for
   a Best Picture Oscar, there was such a wide public outcry that the
   Academy changed its roles to allow for more nominees. That is an
   impact.

   Now: The Dark Knight is a better movie than the perfectly okay Slumdog
   Millionaire, the movie that ended up winning Best Picture for that
   year. But it’s no masterpiece. The Dark Knight is jagged and
   propulsive, sometimes to a fault. Scenes rarely get a chance to linger,
   to establish dramatic presence. When, for instance, Bruce Wayne is
   getting ready to quit being Batman and let Harvey Dent take over as
   Gotham City’s protector, there is no emotional weight there; it’s just
   a storyline move. The movie includes the best action set piece in any
   Batman movie, the astonishing truck chase, but the regular fight scenes
   (like the ones in Batman Begins) are too choppy to be properly
   thrilling. There’s the long Hong Kong interlude, which is pretty and
   fun but also extraneous and dumb—a clear excuse to get some Batman
   ass-kicking into a stretch of the movie that was otherwise notably
   devoid of Batman ass-kicking.

   And then there’s the last 40 minutes of the movie, where everything
   gets baggy and indistinct and sometimes dumb. The Joker gets an
   anticlimactic sendoff, dangling upside-down and trading barbs with
   Batman before Batman rushes off to find that Harvey Dent has become
   Two-Face. A surprisingly moving Tiny Lister moment saves a sequence
   that’s otherwise a dramatized version of a freshman philosophy-class
   thought experiment. And then there’s the whole thing about Batman
   bugging everyone’s cellphones, using a magical TV-bank doohickey to
   listen the Joker’s voice-waves (or whatever) while dumb-looking
   static-light things go over his eyes. For way too long, the movie turns
   into an episode of 24. When The Dark Knight came out, I can vividly
   remember seeing Glenn Beck on CNN, enthusiastically crowing about how
   the film was endorsing George W. Bush’s Patriot Act tactics. You never
   want Glenn Beck to think that you’re on his side.

   For all that, though, The Dark Knight still represents a towering
   achievement, from the nasty economy of the opening robbery scene to the
   final goosebump moment where Gary Oldman intones the movie’s title.
   Christopher Nolan made a fantastically engrossing summer entertainment
   full of big gestures that still sustained a fevered, immersive mood.
   The whole idea of The Dark Knight is that insanity begets more
   insanity. Batman has gone to extreme lengths to keep his city safe, and
   then he’s forced to contend with the possibility that he’s only made
   things worse, inspiring a wave of bad guys that’s just as into symbolic
   gestures as he is. Throughout the movie, we see images of that insanity
   encroaching: piles of money burning, corpses dangling, a civic hero
   transformed into a hate-driven freak. It’s there in the filmmaking,
   too—in the drones and whines of the incredible score, in the way the
   disorienting cameras whirl around simple conversations. And of course,
   it’s there in Heath Ledger.

   Ledger’s whole performance was a focus of widespread fascination before
   the movie had even come out. Before The Dark Knight, most of us figured
   that Jack Nicholson had already been the definitive Joker in Tim
   Burton’s 1989 Batman. (In an interview before The Dark Knight’s
   release, Nicholson said that he was “furious” that nobody had called
   him to be in this new Batman movie.) But then Ledger died of an
   accidental overdose months before the movie came out. This was one of
   the most truly shocking celebrity deaths of this century. It was River
   Phoenix all over again: a charismatic and talented young star who’d
   already proven himself as a talent and who didn’t really give off the
   image of someone who had problems like that.

   Ledger’s death was sad, even for those of us who’d never met him. But
   I’ll speak only for myself here: In some dark and shitty corner of my
   mind, his death also made me more excited for the movie. Maybe, I
   thought, Ledger had pushed himself so far into darkness while making
   this movie that he didn’t fully know how to pull himself out. Maybe he
   had essentially killed himself in bringing this character to life. And
   maybe that deadly devotion would manifest itself onscreen.

   Ledger’s death lent the movie a weird romanticism, sort of like the one
   that Kurt Cobain’s suicide gave to Nirvana’s MTV Unplugged In New York.
   Suddenly, we knew we were watching a major artist giving his last major
   work. This is the wrong way to think. There’s nothing romantic about
   death by addiction. It’s messy and shitty and sad, and it doesn’t fit
   into the pat narratives that we come up with.

   And yet Ledger’s performance as the Joker really was magical—powerful
   enough that Nicholson’s Joker almost instantly became a faded footnote.
   As the Joker, Ledger is legitimately disgusting: dirty and scarred-up,
   with yellow teeth and a tongue that’s constantly darting in and out of
   his mouth, like a lizard’s. But he’s magnetic, too. He tells different
   stories about his scars, just so we’ll know that he’s always lying. He
   confounds criminals as badly as he does police. He dances his way
   through a hospital explosion and intimidates a roomful of mob bosses.
   His voice—the best description I can manage is a tweaked-out Richard
   Nixon impression—is chilling and alien. And he seems to be in love with
   Batman in ways that make even Batman uncomfortable: “Don’t talk like
   you’re one of them. You’re not.”

   The criminal-mastermind stuff in The Dark Knight is fun. Even when you
   know it’s coming, the Joker’s escape from the police station is
   gripping; he’s putting such work into his schemes. And nobody’s ever
   handled a bazooka as nonchalantly as Ledger does during that chase
   scene. But the real great thing about The Dark Knight is the way the
   Joker has no real purpose—how his purpose is purposelessness. He calls
   himself “an agent of chaos,” which is both on-the-nose and accurate. We
   never get a real origin story for this Joker. He doesn’t even have a
   name. He’s just a force, a walking human entropy, “nothing in his
   pockets but knives and lint.”

   He’s a hell of a storytelling device, too. Nolan’s real point with the
   movie, I think, is to illustrate how close so many of are to madness,
   how civilization is always hanging by a fragile thread. That’s why the
   movie’s central tragedy is in the way Harvey Dent falls apart, and
   that’s why Batman ends the movie by willingly transforming himself into
   a scapegoat. It’s a compelling arc, and yet Ledger’s Joker cuts such a
   powerful figure that it overwhelms the movie, turning both Dent and
   Batman into marginal figures. The most memorable image in the movie
   isn’t Dent’s Two-Face reveal or Batman disappearing back into shadow at
   the end. It’s the Joker, high on his own malevolence, hanging his head
   out of a cop-car window like he’s a dog.

   Maybe Nolan intended for this to happen, and maybe he didn’t. Either
   way, he put together a cultural sensation that still has its hooks in
   us. Think of the way so many stray phrases from that beautifully
   written script have seeped into the lexicon: “You either die a hero, or
   you live long enough to see yourself become the villain,” “some men
   just want to watch the world burn,” “destined to do this forever.” The
   Dark Knight has entered the collective unconscious. It’ll always be
   with us.

   And for that reason, I’d argue that The Dark Knight is the most
   important superhero movie in history, not just of 2008. The Dark Knight
   is the reason that the public at large is willing to take superhero
   movies so seriously. It’s the buzz that we’re still chasing. It’s the
   promise fulfilled. It’s a vast summer blockbuster made without even the
   slightest consideration given to entertaining children, which of course
   means that children love it. The Dark Knight is an influential movie,
   of course, with goobers like Zack Snyder and David Ayer attempting to
   use its all-pervading bad vibes in way more ham-fisted ways. But its
   importance goes far beyond that direct influence.

   Iron Man was a miracle, of course, but I’d argue that after that, the
   Marvel Cinematic Universe didn’t produce another actual good movie for
   another three years. And I think The Dark Knight, just as much as Iron
   Man, is the reason that the Marvel Cinematic Universe is still around
   and still dominating. The Dark Knight showed Hollywood studios, and the
   public at large, what a superhero movie could be. After that, everyone
   had to try a whole lot harder.

   Other notable 2008 superhero movies: We’ve already addressed Iron Man
   in some depth. There’s an argument to be made that Iron Man is the
   second-most important superhero movie ever made. Hell, there’s probably
   an argument that it’s the most important superhero movie.

   But we should also talk about The Incredible Hulk, Marvel’s other
   inaugural MCU offering. Maybe it was brave of Marvel to attempt a
   reboot of their big green rage-monster only five years after the Ang
   Lee version. And the movie has some fun scenes, like a battle between
   the Hulk and some Army troops on a college campus. But French
   action-movie auteur Louis Leterrier gave the movie a drab, flat look,
   and star Edward Norton rewrote the script, making it heavier than it
   had to be. Marvel learned its lesson, adapting a bright and shiny
   in-house look and jettisoning both Norton and Iron Man’s Terrence
   Howard for actors who would play ball. In making these moves, Marvel
   effectively killed the primacy of both stars and directors, recognizing
   the characters and the storylines as the real draws. So now The
   Incredible Hulk is a historic scrapheap curiosity.

   Another road-not-taken Marvel movie is Lexi Alexander’s almost
   hilariously violent Punisher: War Zone, the third and probably final
   attempt to turn Marvel’s brutal vigilante antihero into a movie’s
   leading man. In this one, Ray Stevenson plays Frank Castle as a
   gigantic stab-happy Jason Voorhees motherfucker, a stone-carved killing
   machine, while Alexander piles on the exaggerated slapstick gore and
   various character actors, led by Dominic West, do their best to make
   Castle’s victims into unsympathetic caricatures. Marvel is probably
   right that the Punisher is better in Netflix-miniseries form than as
   the star of a major motion picture, but I really love this movie’s
   hyper-violent absurdism.

   With Hellboy II: The Golden Army, future Oscar winner Guillermo del
   Toro brought back the beloved cult-comics figure he’d already adapted
   and pitted him against a horde of magical Celtic-myth elf-creatures.
   Del Toro’s never been afraid of silliness, and Hellboy II has plenty of
   that. But it’s also a movie full of imaginative monster designs and
   gorgeous fantastical images. I don’t think it’s a classic, the way some
   people do, but it is top-shelf stoner spectacle.

   Hancock is another curiosity: a big-budget summer movie about a newly
   invented superhero, a way-too-powerful unreliable drunk with mysterious
   origins and no idea how to function alongside the rest of society. The
   movie doesn’t altogether work, but it does make some fascinatingly
   strange turns, especially once we learn a few things about a couple of
   characters’ origins.

   With The Spirit, meanwhile, comics legend Frank Miller, directing by
   himself for the first time, tried to make a CGI-heavy noir adaptation
   out of Will Eisner’s foundational superhero comic strip. The result is
   a notorious disaster, a self-important work of aestheticized nonsense
   that wastes the talents of way too many movie stars who should’ve known
   better. It’s the sort of movie that forces us to reconsider whether
   Frank Miller really was ever that great or whether he was just skating
   through his career on one hard-boiled cliché after another.

   The Spirit villain Samuel L. Jackson, still in the process of becoming
   Nick Fury, was also a villain in Doug Liman’s Jumper, about a kid who
   discovers that he’s part of a secret teleporting race. The pretty-good
   animated movie Bolt gave us the story of a TV-actor dog who thinks he,
   like his TV character, has actual powers. Franklyn was a British movie
   with Ryan Phillippe as a masked crimefighter who travels between
   realities. The superhero-adjacent Wanted adapted a deeply toxic Mark
   Millar comic about a society of supernaturally gifted assassins.
   Meanwhile, the dumber-than-fuck parody Superhero Movie was a
   probably-premature joke-a-minute parody about the still-developing
   superhero-movie genre. But since the parody-movie genre was on its last
   legs at the time, and since the movie sucked, it didn’t make much
   impact.

   Next time: Zack Snyder adapts Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’ foundational
   comic-book masterpiece Watchmen into a confounding big-budget movie.

A deck of Jokers: Going deeper with The Clown Prince Of Crime

   In addition to all of the things the Joker publicity cycle has assured
   us Todd Phillips’ Batman-adjacent Scorsese riff is not—not an
   incitement to violence, not an endorsement of its main character’s
   actions, not subject to questions from red-carpet interviewers—there’s
   also this: Despite telling the story of an aspiring comedian who
   becomes an unhinged murder-clown, it’s not a canonical origin story.
   Joker has no connection to any ongoing onscreen saga set in Gotham
   City; Joaquin Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck will not go on to become Jack
   Nicholson’s purring hood Jack Napier, the agent of chaos that earned
   Heath Ledger a posthumous Oscar, or the chrome-grilled edge lord who
   stamped “damaged” on his forehead for Suicide Squad. Rather, he’s
   another voice in a giggling gestalt that has beguiled, tickled, and
   terrified audiences and creators ever since Jerry Robinson first laid
   down a sketch of a Joker card with crimson lips and a fearsome smile.
   The Joker, like his crime-fighting other half, isn’t a fixed idea but
   an ever-evolving archetype: the comical disguise Cesar Romero could don
   without shaving, the lanky killer of ’70s Batman comics, the villain
   who got Mark Hamill to give into the dark side.

So, wait: What’s going on with all these Jokers?

   Last week, Hangover director Todd Phillips began revealing his upcoming
   Joker origin story. It…

   As such, there’s not really anything you need to know about the
   character before seeing the first movie to ever put his name in the
   title. (Because let’s be straight here: This is far from the first time
   the Joker has ever headlined a movie.) But ahead of Joker, you might be
   wondering: What’s the deal with this clown, and why do we keep telling
   stories about him? Without delving too deeply into the obvious—in 2019,
   nobody needs to be out here championing the Tim Burton Batman, The Dark
   Knight, The Killing Joke, or The Dark Knight Returns (though, if you
   haven’t seen or read those, you really should)—perhaps the following
   recommendations can offer some insight. And if they don’t, maybe you
   need to ask yourself another question: Why so serious?

Batman, “Surf’s Up! Joker’s Under!” (1968)

   Cesar Romero romanced Betty Grable and saved the day as the Cisco Kid
   before painting over his signature mustache in the role he’d be best
   remembered for: Scuffling with Adam West and Burt Ward in 22 episodes
   of the ’60s live-action Batman series (and its big-screen spin-off).
   Each of those appearances were memorable, but from a simply bizarre
   (and beachy) perspective, one stands out: Season three’s “Surf’s Up!
   Joker’s Under!” At the time, the surfing craze had engulfed so much of
   popular culture that even the Joker was trying to win over the kids at
   Gotham Point by catching a wave in a contest against his arch nemesis.
   It’s largely an excuse for the Batman cast (including Batgirl!) to trot
   out slang like “island pullout” and “cowabunga,” but Joker (and Batman,
   for that matter) have never looked more ridiculous than wearing their
   “baggies” in front of an obvious rear-projection setup. Naturally,
   Batman is the eventual winner, due to the timely use of his Bat-Shark
   Repellant, and the indefatigable Joker is defeated yet again. Romero’s
   campy portrayal may have been the most benign of all Jokers, but he was
   also a hell of a lot of fun. [Gwen Ihnat]

A Death In The Family (1988)

   Jim Starlin and Jim Aparo’s A Death In The Family is famous as the
   story where the Joker captures and brutally tortures Jason Todd, the
   second Robin, before leaving him to die in an explosion. That’s the
   part everyone knows, but the Joker’s scheme goes completely off the
   wall in the final act. See, Jason got captured while he and Batman were
   investigating the Joker’s attempt to sell a nuclear weapon to Iran
   (this was the ’80s, after all), and Ayatollah Khomeini is so pleased
   with what the Joker is offering that he names the Clown Prince of Crime
   as his country’s representative to the United Nations and sends him to
   make a speech at the General Assembly in New York City—with the U.S.
   government actually using Superman to stop Batman from doing anything
   in hopes of avoiding an international incident. The speech turns out to
   be a sham and the Joker tries to kill everyone, obviously, giving
   Batman and Superman a chance to beat him up. Later, in a fit of grief
   over Jason’s death, Batman even allows the Joker to nearly get killed
   in a helicopter crash (though he somehow escapes unharmed). [Sam

Batman: The Animated Series, “The Laughing Fish” (1993)

   This one’s a threefer, the plots of two legendary comics—“The Joker’s
   Five-Way Revenge” and “The Laughing Fish,” each from a separate,
   legendary run in Batman’s flagship titles—synthesized by the TV series
   that dared to challenge Jack Nicholson for the title of definitive
   onscreen Joker a scant three years after his dance with the devil in
   the pale moon light. It could be a hybrid that looks as unnatural or
   unsightly as the episode’s smiling catch of the day, a televised
   cartoon recreating source material where the Joker bumps off innocent
   copyright clerks and attempts to feed an old man to a shark. This
   “Laughing Fish” hangs together thanks to the fact that those
   comics—widely credited with restoring the Joker’s sense of murderous
   menace (and in the case of Neal Adams and Denny O’Neil’s “Five-Way
   Revenge,” restoring the character’s presence on the comics page,
   period)—begin and end with some toothy sea creatures; it also helps
   that two of the driving forces behind Batman: The Animated, Bruce Timm
   and Paul Dini, are there to guide the episode along the razor’s edge.
   But the most important name in the credits is Mark Hamill, whose crazed
   carnival barker approach to the Joker projects a threat (his cackling
   entrance is just aces) even as the character dons an angler’s cap,
   signals to henchman with a whoopee cushion, and interrupts regularly
   scheduled programming to plug the seafood he’s rendered in his image
   for seemingly arbitrary reasons. Leave it to the Joker to render
   trademark registration into rip-roaring superhero action. [Erik Adams]

Batman Beyond: Return Of The Joker (2000)

   The slick cyberpunk series Batman Beyond acts as a continuation of
   Batman: The Animated Series and The New Batman Adventures, introducing
   viewers to a new Batman—the 16-year-old Terry McGinnis—and a new
   setting—Neo-Gotham in 2039. Beyond also abandoned most of Batman’s
   classic rogues gallery, the most notable exception being the
   direct-to-video feature, Return Of The Joker, released during the
   show’s third and final season. Return Of The Joker marked the first and
   only appearance of the original Clown Prince of Crime in the Beyond
   universe—until that point in the series, he was only referenced through
   the amateurish, Juggalo-looking street gang The Jokerz, who terrorized
   Neo-Gotham in his name. The film opens with the mysterious reappearance
   of The Joker (voiced by a returning Mark Hamill), who was presumed dead
   after an encounter with the original Batman. Without giving too much
   away, what follows is an intriguing expansion of the mythos surrounding
   Hamill’s Joker that occasionally drifts into unsettling territory—one
   scene in particular, a flashback involving the Joker and Batman’s
   former protégé Tim Drake, is genuinely disturbing. In fact, there was
   so much concern over Return Of The Joker’s imagery in the wake of the
   Columbine massacre, Warner Bros. Animation re-edited the film prior to
   its release. The “uncut” version was released on DVD shortly
   thereafter, and is now widely available. [Baraka Kaseko]

Batman #663, “The Clown At Midnight” (2010)

   Few comic authors of the modern era have spent more time or energy on
   the question of what—not who—the Joker really is than Grant Morrison,
   whose character-redefining run on Batman in the late 2000s always
   seemed to circle back somehow to the Thin White Duke of Death. That
   tendency expresses itself most clearly in the prose-only “The Clown At
   Midnight,” in which the Joker methodically, and brutally, kills off all
   of his former henchman in an effort to wipe the slate clean and ready
   himself to become the next, even more monstrous version of his numerous
   personas. Morrison’s Batman run frequently falls back on the idea that
   every weird, nonsensical, magical, or science-fiction adventure that
   Batman engaged in back in the Silver Age really happened, in some form
   or another. “The Clown At Midnight” similarly argues that every Joker
   is the essential Joker, from the boner-spouting goofball of the “Satire
   Years,” to the cold-blooded killer of the New Homicidal, or the
   gleefully smiling clown of the Camp. (Those are all Mistah J’s terms,
   not ours.) In Morrison’s conception, the Joker is simply the ultimate
   survivor, “shuffling selves like a croupier deals cards, to buffer the
   shocks and work some alchemy that might just turn the lead of tragedy
   and horror into into the fierce, chaotic gold of the laughter of the
   damned.” Or, as Morrison also can’t help but note: Maybe he’s just
   nuts. [William Hughes]

Batman: Under The Red Hood (2010)

   Jason Todd’s blood may have been on the Joker’s hands, but it was
   really the majority of Batman readers who (narrowly) killed the second
   Boy Wonder in 1988. But just like in soap operas, popular comics
   characters rarely stay dead forever, and Jason eventually returned,
   first in the “Under The Hood” storyline that ran from 2004 to 2006, and
   then an excellent direct-to-video movie in 2010. The movie reveals that
   after Joker beat Robin with a crowbar and blew him up in a warehouse,
   Ra’s al Ghul swiped Jason’s body and revived him in the Lazarus Pit.
   Jason grows up to be a crime boss known as the Red Hood (an alias that
   factors into the Joker’s classic origin story), but his biggest beef
   with Batman is the same as many of ours: Why is Joker still alive?
   Jensen Ackles impressively captures Jason’s combined rage and grief as
   he protests: “If it had been you that he beat to a bloody pulp, if he
   had taken you from this world, I would’ve done nothing but search the
   planet for this pathetic pile of evil, death-worshiping garbage and
   then send him off to hell!” Although Joker basically functions as a
   pawn here in the battle between Jason and his former mentor, Under The
   Red Hood uncovers the truth of Batman’s eternal moral quandary. Voiced
   by Bruce Greenwood, Batman painfully admits as much to Jason: He thinks
   about killing Joker every day, but once he started killing, he’d never
   stop, and his battle over the darkness in his own soul would be lost:
   “If I allow myself to go down into that place… I’ll never come back.”
   So Joker survives, continuing to torment Batman as long as the Caped
   Crusader exists. [Gwen Ihnat]

Endgame (2012)

   Illustration for article titled A deck of Jokers: Going deeper with The
   Clown Prince Of Crime
   Screenshot: Engame

   A lot of Joker stories are about his perception of the relationship he
   has with Batman, like The Dark Knight’s “you complete me” speech, but
   Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo’s Endgame story arc is an inversion of
   that. After years of trying to convince Batman that they’re essentially
   soulmates, the Joker is done. He just wants Batman to die. To do that,
   he releases a gas in Gotham that forces everyone (including the Justice
   League) to try and kill their loved ones. As he searches for a cure,
   Batman realizes that an Arkham orderly named Eric Border (who had been
   in Batman comics for a year or so) was actually the Joker in disguise,
   and he finds seemingly definitive proof that Joker is actually
   immortal. It’s more complicated than that, but the story ends with both
   Joker and Batman seemingly dying when an underground cave collapses on
   them. Make sure to stick around for the next story arc, where an
   amnesiac Bruce Wayne meets a somewhat “cured” Joker who is trying to
   live an honest life and pleads with him to never put on the cape and
   cowl again—because he’s afraid of what he’ll become if Batman returns.

Batman: Arkham Knight (2015)

   (BUTTON) (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   Mark Hamill’s definitive vocal take on the Joker rarely got a better
   chance to shine than in Rocksteady’s trilogy of Batman-based Arkham
   games, where—dead, or alive—the Joker always seemed to somehow get the
   last laugh. Nowhere was that clearer than in 2015’s big finale to the
   series, Arkham Knight, where Hamill’s drolly cackling supercriminal
   refuses to let a silly little thing like dying at the end of the
   previous game get in the way of spreading some of his signature mirth.
   The game’s most brilliant twist—empowered by a dose of fear toxin from
   its ostensible “main” villain, Scarecrow—places Hamill’s Joker as the
   intangible, constantly snarking devil on Bruce Wayne’s shoulder,
   driving him deeper and deeper into green-eyed madness as the night
   wears on. Hamill has always been the funniest of the Jokers, but he
   really gets a chance to shine here, laying down one-liner after
   one-liner that only his increasingly harried “buddy” can hear. At the
   same time, he gleefully leans into the series’ vision of the Joker’s
   most terrifying trait: Not what he’s done to people, or what he will
   do. Rather, it’s the madness he represents, always looming and
   threatening to eat away at the mind of a hero who often seems like he
   might be one bad night away from finally getting the joke. [William
   Hughes]

   [avclub-saturated.png] Age Of HeroesWith Age Of Heroes, Tom Breihan
   picks the most important superhero movie of every year, starting with
   the genre’s early big-budget moments and moving onto the
   multiplex-crushing monsters of today.

   Midway through Christopher Nolan’s 2008 movie The Dark Knight, the
   Joker gets himself arrested so that he can then break out of his
   holding cell and continue his grand experiment in human darkness. While
   he’s locked up, he’s placed in the custody of the Major Crimes Unit,
   the police force that’s supposedly been devoted to locking up Batman.
   In the movie, people keep referring to the Major Crimes Unit as the
   MCU. As in: “There’s a problem at the MCU!” Watching it today, you
   might hurt your neck doing double-takes at those initials every time.
   The Dark Knight, as it happens, came out at the last moment that “MCU”
   could possibly refer to anything related to Batman.

   Today, of course, we know the MCU as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the
   steamrolling blockbuster-generating engine that has become the dominant
   commercial force in all of moviemaking. It was never a given that the
   Marvel Cinematic Universe would work. By the time the people at Marvel
   got around to establishing their own movie studio, they’d already sold
   off the rights to many of their most-famous characters: Spider-Man, the
   X-Men, the Fantastic Four. Only the relative dregs were left over, and
   nobody knew whether a relatively minor character like Iron Man could
   anchor a whole movie, let alone a franchise. It was a gamble.

   It was a gamble, too, to cast Robert Downey Jr., a faded star who’d
   spent years battling his personal demons. It was a gamble to go against
   the sober, contemplative tone of superhero movies like Batman Begins or
   Superman Returns. Marvel instead found a light, quippy aesthetic—one
   that acknowledged the absurdity of the whole enterprise while still
   allowing for genuine adventure-serial thrills. (The Incredible Hulk,
   the second Marvel Cinematic Universe film, which came out a month
   before The Dark Knight, marked an altogether-unsuccessful reversion to
   that serious, heavy style.) The Iron Man gamble paid off spectacularly,
   many times over.

   Iron Man wasn’t just a hit, and it wasn’t just a tremendously
   entertaining movie. It was the foundation upon which an entire movie
   institution was built. More than a decade later, Marvel is still
   running with that tone and that aesthetic, and it is utterly dominating
   everything else in Hollywood. Rewatching Iron Man today, it’s
   remarkable how much of what would later power the whole franchise is
   already there: S.H.I.E.L.D, Agent Coulson, Downey’s nonstop smirky
   patter, Tony Stark’s unfortunate tendency to power up his own enemies,
   the soothing robot voice that Paul Bettany adopted years before he
   found himself painted red and green. (It’s also a more intense movie
   than you might remember. I tried to show it to my kids, and they were
   done as soon as the missiles hit the convoy.) And with that famous Iron
   Man post-credits scene, Marvel set up a dizzying array of future-movie
   possibilities. And then it somehow made good on those possibilities.
   That’s amazing.

   Iron Man’s importance, both to superhero movies and to cinema in
   general, cannot be overstated. And yet Iron Man was not the most
   important superhero movie of 2008. That distinction belongs to The Dark
   Knight, which was a genuine cultural phenomenon and which changed the
   way the public at large saw superheroes in the same way that Jaws
   changed sharks or Star Wars changed spaceships. Before The Dark Knight,
   superhero movies made money, but they were a sideshow. The Dark Knight
   made money, too; it was the highest-grossing movie of 2008. But it
   didn’t just make money. It was, in its moment, widely hailed as
   something resembling a masterpiece. When, for instance, the Academy Of
   Motion Picture Arts And Sciences failed to nominate The Dark Knight for
   a Best Picture Oscar, there was such a wide public outcry that the
   Academy changed its roles to allow for more nominees. That is an
   impact.

   Now: The Dark Knight is a better movie than the perfectly okay Slumdog
   Millionaire, the movie that ended up winning Best Picture for that
   year. But it’s no masterpiece. The Dark Knight is jagged and
   propulsive, sometimes to a fault. Scenes rarely get a chance to linger,
   to establish dramatic presence. When, for instance, Bruce Wayne is
   getting ready to quit being Batman and let Harvey Dent take over as
   Gotham City’s protector, there is no emotional weight there; it’s just
   a storyline move. The movie includes the best action set piece in any
   Batman movie, the astonishing truck chase, but the regular fight scenes
   (like the ones in Batman Begins) are too choppy to be properly
   thrilling. There’s the long Hong Kong interlude, which is pretty and
   fun but also extraneous and dumb—a clear excuse to get some Batman
   ass-kicking into a stretch of the movie that was otherwise notably
   devoid of Batman ass-kicking.

   And then there’s the last 40 minutes of the movie, where everything
   gets baggy and indistinct and sometimes dumb. The Joker gets an
   anticlimactic sendoff, dangling upside-down and trading barbs with
   Batman before Batman rushes off to find that Harvey Dent has become
   Two-Face. A surprisingly moving Tiny Lister moment saves a sequence
   that’s otherwise a dramatized version of a freshman philosophy-class
   thought experiment. And then there’s the whole thing about Batman
   bugging everyone’s cellphones, using a magical TV-bank doohickey to
   listen the Joker’s voice-waves (or whatever) while dumb-looking
   static-light things go over his eyes. For way too long, the movie turns
   into an episode of 24. When The Dark Knight came out, I can vividly
   remember seeing Glenn Beck on CNN, enthusiastically crowing about how
   the film was endorsing George W. Bush’s Patriot Act tactics. You never
   want Glenn Beck to think that you’re on his side.

   For all that, though, The Dark Knight still represents a towering
   achievement, from the nasty economy of the opening robbery scene to the
   final goosebump moment where Gary Oldman intones the movie’s title.
   Christopher Nolan made a fantastically engrossing summer entertainment
   full of big gestures that still sustained a fevered, immersive mood.
   The whole idea of The Dark Knight is that insanity begets more
   insanity. Batman has gone to extreme lengths to keep his city safe, and
   then he’s forced to contend with the possibility that he’s only made
   things worse, inspiring a wave of bad guys that’s just as into symbolic
   gestures as he is. Throughout the movie, we see images of that insanity
   encroaching: piles of money burning, corpses dangling, a civic hero
   transformed into a hate-driven freak. It’s there in the filmmaking,
   too—in the drones and whines of the incredible score, in the way the
   disorienting cameras whirl around simple conversations. And of course,
   it’s there in Heath Ledger.

   Ledger’s whole performance was a focus of widespread fascination before
   the movie had even come out. Before The Dark Knight, most of us figured
   that Jack Nicholson had already been the definitive Joker in Tim
   Burton’s 1989 Batman. (In an interview before The Dark Knight’s
   release, Nicholson said that he was “furious” that nobody had called
   him to be in this new Batman movie.) But then Ledger died of an
   accidental overdose months before the movie came out. This was one of
   the most truly shocking celebrity deaths of this century. It was River
   Phoenix all over again: a charismatic and talented young star who’d
   already proven himself as a talent and who didn’t really give off the
   image of someone who had problems like that.

   Ledger’s death was sad, even for those of us who’d never met him. But
   I’ll speak only for myself here: In some dark and shitty corner of my
   mind, his death also made me more excited for the movie. Maybe, I
   thought, Ledger had pushed himself so far into darkness while making
   this movie that he didn’t fully know how to pull himself out. Maybe he
   had essentially killed himself in bringing this character to life. And
   maybe that deadly devotion would manifest itself onscreen.

   Ledger’s death lent the movie a weird romanticism, sort of like the one
   that Kurt Cobain’s suicide gave to Nirvana’s MTV Unplugged In New York.
   Suddenly, we knew we were watching a major artist giving his last major
   work. This is the wrong way to think. There’s nothing romantic about
   death by addiction. It’s messy and shitty and sad, and it doesn’t fit
   into the pat narratives that we come up with.

   And yet Ledger’s performance as the Joker really was magical—powerful
   enough that Nicholson’s Joker almost instantly became a faded footnote.
   As the Joker, Ledger is legitimately disgusting: dirty and scarred-up,
   with yellow teeth and a tongue that’s constantly darting in and out of
   his mouth, like a lizard’s. But he’s magnetic, too. He tells different
   stories about his scars, just so we’ll know that he’s always lying. He
   confounds criminals as badly as he does police. He dances his way
   through a hospital explosion and intimidates a roomful of mob bosses.
   His voice—the best description I can manage is a tweaked-out Richard
   Nixon impression—is chilling and alien. And he seems to be in love with
   Batman in ways that make even Batman uncomfortable: “Don’t talk like
   you’re one of them. You’re not.”

   The criminal-mastermind stuff in The Dark Knight is fun. Even when you
   know it’s coming, the Joker’s escape from the police station is
   gripping; he’s putting such work into his schemes. And nobody’s ever
   handled a bazooka as nonchalantly as Ledger does during that chase
   scene. But the real great thing about The Dark Knight is the way the
   Joker has no real purpose—how his purpose is purposelessness. He calls
   himself “an agent of chaos,” which is both on-the-nose and accurate. We
   never get a real origin story for this Joker. He doesn’t even have a
   name. He’s just a force, a walking human entropy, “nothing in his
   pockets but knives and lint.”

   He’s a hell of a storytelling device, too. Nolan’s real point with the
   movie, I think, is to illustrate how close so many of are to madness,
   how civilization is always hanging by a fragile thread. That’s why the
   movie’s central tragedy is in the way Harvey Dent falls apart, and
   that’s why Batman ends the movie by willingly transforming himself into
   a scapegoat. It’s a compelling arc, and yet Ledger’s Joker cuts such a
   powerful figure that it overwhelms the movie, turning both Dent and
   Batman into marginal figures. The most memorable image in the movie
   isn’t Dent’s Two-Face reveal or Batman disappearing back into shadow at
   the end. It’s the Joker, high on his own malevolence, hanging his head
   out of a cop-car window like he’s a dog.

   Maybe Nolan intended for this to happen, and maybe he didn’t. Either
   way, he put together a cultural sensation that still has its hooks in
   us. Think of the way so many stray phrases from that beautifully
   written script have seeped into the lexicon: “You either die a hero, or
   you live long enough to see yourself become the villain,” “some men
   just want to watch the world burn,” “destined to do this forever.” The
   Dark Knight has entered the collective unconscious. It’ll always be
   with us.

   And for that reason, I’d argue that The Dark Knight is the most
   important superhero movie in history, not just of 2008. The Dark Knight
   is the reason that the public at large is willing to take superhero
   movies so seriously. It’s the buzz that we’re still chasing. It’s the
   promise fulfilled. It’s a vast summer blockbuster made without even the
   slightest consideration given to entertaining children, which of course
   means that children love it. The Dark Knight is an influential movie,
   of course, with goobers like Zack Snyder and David Ayer attempting to
   use its all-pervading bad vibes in way more ham-fisted ways. But its
   importance goes far beyond that direct influence.

   Iron Man was a miracle, of course, but I’d argue that after that, the
   Marvel Cinematic Universe didn’t produce another actual good movie for
   another three years. And I think The Dark Knight, just as much as Iron
   Man, is the reason that the Marvel Cinematic Universe is still around
   and still dominating. The Dark Knight showed Hollywood studios, and the
   public at large, what a superhero movie could be. After that, everyone
   had to try a whole lot harder.

   Other notable 2008 superhero movies: We’ve already addressed Iron Man
   in some depth. There’s an argument to be made that Iron Man is the
   second-most important superhero movie ever made. Hell, there’s probably
   an argument that it’s the most important superhero movie.

   But we should also talk about The Incredible Hulk, Marvel’s other
   inaugural MCU offering. Maybe it was brave of Marvel to attempt a
   reboot of their big green rage-monster only five years after the Ang
   Lee version. And the movie has some fun scenes, like a battle between
   the Hulk and some Army troops on a college campus. But French
   action-movie auteur Louis Leterrier gave the movie a drab, flat look,
   and star Edward Norton rewrote the script, making it heavier than it
   had to be. Marvel learned its lesson, adapting a bright and shiny
   in-house look and jettisoning both Norton and Iron Man’s Terrence
   Howard for actors who would play ball. In making these moves, Marvel
   effectively killed the primacy of both stars and directors, recognizing
   the characters and the storylines as the real draws. So now The
   Incredible Hulk is a historic scrapheap curiosity.

   Another road-not-taken Marvel movie is Lexi Alexander’s almost
   hilariously violent Punisher: War Zone, the third and probably final
   attempt to turn Marvel’s brutal vigilante antihero into a movie’s
   leading man. In this one, Ray Stevenson plays Frank Castle as a
   gigantic stab-happy Jason Voorhees motherfucker, a stone-carved killing
   machine, while Alexander piles on the exaggerated slapstick gore and
   various character actors, led by Dominic West, do their best to make
   Castle’s victims into unsympathetic caricatures. Marvel is probably
   right that the Punisher is better in Netflix-miniseries form than as
   the star of a major motion picture, but I really love this movie’s
   hyper-violent absurdism.

   With Hellboy II: The Golden Army, future Oscar winner Guillermo del
   Toro brought back the beloved cult-comics figure he’d already adapted
   and pitted him against a horde of magical Celtic-myth elf-creatures.
   Del Toro’s never been afraid of silliness, and Hellboy II has plenty of
   that. But it’s also a movie full of imaginative monster designs and
   gorgeous fantastical images. I don’t think it’s a classic, the way some
   people do, but it is top-shelf stoner spectacle.

   Hancock is another curiosity: a big-budget summer movie about a newly
   invented superhero, a way-too-powerful unreliable drunk with mysterious
   origins and no idea how to function alongside the rest of society. The
   movie doesn’t altogether work, but it does make some fascinatingly
   strange turns, especially once we learn a few things about a couple of
   characters’ origins.

   With The Spirit, meanwhile, comics legend Frank Miller, directing by
   himself for the first time, tried to make a CGI-heavy noir adaptation
   out of Will Eisner’s foundational superhero comic strip. The result is
   a notorious disaster, a self-important work of aestheticized nonsense
   that wastes the talents of way too many movie stars who should’ve known
   better. It’s the sort of movie that forces us to reconsider whether
   Frank Miller really was ever that great or whether he was just skating
   through his career on one hard-boiled cliché after another.

   The Spirit villain Samuel L. Jackson, still in the process of becoming
   Nick Fury, was also a villain in Doug Liman’s Jumper, about a kid who
   discovers that he’s part of a secret teleporting race. The pretty-good
   animated movie Bolt gave us the story of a TV-actor dog who thinks he,
   like his TV character, has actual powers. Franklyn was a British movie
   with Ryan Phillippe as a masked crimefighter who travels between
   realities. The superhero-adjacent Wanted adapted a deeply toxic Mark
   Millar comic about a society of supernaturally gifted assassins.
   Meanwhile, the dumber-than-fuck parody Superhero Movie was a
   probably-premature joke-a-minute parody about the still-developing
   superhero-movie genre. But since the parody-movie genre was on its last
   legs at the time, and since the movie sucked, it didn’t make much
   impact.

   Next time: Zack Snyder adapts Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’ foundational
   comic-book masterpiece Watchmen into a confounding big-budget movie.

   [avclub-saturated.png] Age Of HeroesWith Age Of Heroes, Tom Breihan
   picks the most important superhero movie of every year, starting with
   the genre’s early big-budget moments and moving onto the
   multiplex-crushing monsters of today.

   Christopher Nolan’s Batman movies are as revered as any franchise of
   summer blockbusters can really be in this day and age. But when people
   make fun of them, they always seem to settle on one thing in
   particular: the Batman voice. When he’s in his Batman suit, Christian
   Bale doesn’t have too many long conversations, but when he does talk,
   it’s in some hybrid of grumpy-dad growl and death-metal grunt. It’s a
   deeply silly construction, this guttural constipated snarl. I fucking
   love it.

   2005’s Batman Begins, Nolan’s introduction to the rebooted franchise,
   was the first Batman movie where a villain wasn’t the most interesting
   character. There are, of course, plenty of villains. Liam Neeson makes
   a couple of surprise turns, rocking some insanely impressive facial
   hair and leading a mob of mysterious, culture-reshaping ninjas. Cillian
   Murphy gives amazing mad-scientist, preening and gibbering and bugging
   his eyes out. The way he delivers the phrase “the Bat Man” is great;
   the way he’s taken out by a secondary character’s taser is less so.
   Even the actorly eminence Tom Wilkinson gets in a walk-on role as a
   mobster, sticking around long enough to make one great speech about how
   “people from your world have so much to lose.”

   They’re all interesting characters, and they all have classically
   impeccable actors playing them. But for once, Batman gets to be the
   real star of a Batman movie. And that voice is the key to it. Christian
   Bale’s Bruce Wayne has been traumatized and sent down a
   self-destructive path. He’s ejected himself from society and gone off
   on the sort of finding-himself quest that has led him to gratuitously
   beat up fellow inmates at a Chinese prison camp. When he finally
   figures out some direction in life, he wants to stop being whatever he
   is and start being a forbidding and shadowy symbol. Using that voice
   isn’t his version of Christopher Reeve’s Clark Kent bumbling around all
   over the place. He’s not doing that voice so that people won’t
   recognize him as Bruce Wayne. He’s doing that voice so that people
   won’t recognize him as a human being.

   As a disguise, though, it works. My favorite scene from Batman Begins
   comes late in the movie, when Bruce Wayne is throwing himself a
   birthday party and realizes that it’s been infiltrated by his old clan
   of conspiratorial ninjas. So he goes into billionaire-asshole mode,
   drunkenly kicking all of his guests out and insulting them in the
   process. In that moment, Bale taps into some of the same oily
   rich-dipshit charisma that he’d conveyed so memorably in Mary Harron’s
   American Psycho five years earlier. He acts the way most actual rich
   guys act. He displays petty grudges, demands to be the center of
   attention, and sneers at anyone with less money than himself. He’s a
   perfect dickhead. He does this to save everyone from the lurking
   ninjas, but he also helps solidify the idea that he couldn’t be Batman.
   Because he’s a rich asshole, and when’s the last time a rich asshole
   showed any interest in being anything other than a rich asshole?

   Batman Begins was a movie with a mission. In the new era of profitable
   comic book blockbusters, Warner Bros. needed to erase the stink of the
   Joel Schumacher Batman movies, camp explosions that became instant
   cultural punchlines from the moment—in the lead-up to Batman & Robin’s
   release date—that the announcement about the Bat-nipples came out.
   Batman Begins exists to set up other movies, too. But even if we’d
   never gotten The Dark Knight out of it, even if the movie had lost tons
   of money and sent Warner scrambling to imagine another reboot, Batman
   Begins would still stand as a pretty amazing example of superhero-movie
   craft.

   Nolan was an inspired choice for this whole enterprise. He’d made his
   impact with the relentlessly clever Memento. With Insomnia, he’d proved
   that he could work with movie stars. With all of his films, he’d shown
   a visual flair and a fascination with the nuts and bolts of story.
   Batman Begins was his leveling-up moment, his big leap into the
   blockbuster arena.

   And Warner must’ve had a whole lot of faith in him. Batman Begins is
   not a movie that skimps on anything. The producers built a pretty
   decent chunk of Gotham City on soundstages in London. They designed the
   Tumbler, a monstrous new version of the Batmobile, and they built four
   working and street-ready versions of it, including one with a literal
   jet engine inside it. They designed a whole new martial arts system for
   Bruce Wayne to practice. And they filled the cast out with
   Oscar-caliber actors, with people like Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine
   and Gary Oldman all taking on relatively minor roles. Ken Watanabe is
   barely in it. Rutger Hauer gets what amounts to an extended cameo. Even
   the weird-looking little kid who Katie Holmes saves, while not remotely
   famous at the time, would go on to play Joffrey on Game Of Thrones.

   For his big Batman reimagining, Nolan wanted to ground the character,
   and his whole world, in something that at least vaguely resembled
   plausible reality. And he put so much care into what he was building.
   Visually, the movie is rich as hell. In the early scene where Christian
   Bale climbs a mountain to meet his ninja clan, we get helicopter shots
   of snowy mountain vistas, banners randomly flapping behind Bale, and
   flowers that look too blue to be real. Nolan finds ways to turn Thomas
   Wayne, a hopeless dupe in almost every retelling of the Batman myth,
   into a decent human being. (Nolan takes pains to make Bruce into the
   descendent of a long line of good rich people, to the point where
   Alfred casually mentions that the Batcave was a stop on the Underground
   Railroad.) He draws lines between economic depression (which, it turns
   out, was caused by ninjas) and high crime rates, and he resists the
   urge to turn Bruce’s parents’ killer into a mindless psychopath.

   Bruce doesn’t become Batman until an hour into the movie, and by that
   time, Nolan has already drawn up a rich world of corrupt politicians,
   corrupt corporate lackeys, corrupt cops, lordly crime bosses, and
   hopelessly trapped regular people. And so there’s a tremendous charge
   in that first transformation scene, with Batman only appearing in
   flashes, and with goons disappearing into shadows. It’s a slasher-movie
   scene, except the slasher is our hero.

   I have this distinct memory of leaving the theater with a friend after
   watching Batman Begins, both of our minds blown, raving about what we’d
   just seen. Superhero movies were just entering their boom period, but
   all of them, even the best ones, had been knowingly silly. No other
   filmmaker had ever really considered the idea that you could tell a
   story like this without winking at least a little bit. But Nolan didn’t
   wink. He took the character and the world around him seriously,
   treating an American myth with a gravity that had never really been on
   screen before. My friend and I were so dumbfounded that I’m pretty sure
   we used the word “believable” to describe what we’d just seen.

   Now, Batman Begins is not a believable movie. There is no way to tell a
   plausible story about a billionaire who, driven by a desire to make the
   world a better place, dresses up like a scary rodent and beats up
   mobsters. And Batman Begins is, at times, deeply silly. History, we
   learn, has been driven entirely by ninja interventions. Batman somehow
   summons a swarm of bats, from his cave, to help him fight off a
   deranged rogue psychiatrist’s goons. A giant rolling assault vehicle
   escapes a horde of police cars and helicopters mostly by turning off
   its lights. And the central evil plan is convoluted and absurd enough
   to leave Lex Luthor muttering to himself. The bad guys want to use a
   weapons-grade microwave to evaporate an entire city’s water supply,
   thus activating the weaponized-hallucinogen fear gas that they’ve been
   pumping into it, and turning the entire population into a wild and
   violent mob. There are easier ways to destroy a city, you know?

   Batman Begins is also a movie full of movie bullshit, characters who
   don’t remain remotely consistent. After spending who knows how long in
   the thrall of a ninja cult, Bruce Wayne refuses to kill a murderous
   farmer, so he sets off an explosion that must kill a whole lot of
   people, presumably including that same murderous farmer. Bruce’s
   butler, Alfred, inherits the entire Wayne estate, happily telling Bruce
   that maybe he can borrow the Rolls. The next time we see Alfred, he’s
   carrying a tray. Upon repeat viewings, little things like that really
   jump out.

   And while this doesn’t have anything to do with the plausibility, I
   have to mention the action scenes. Nolan sets the scenes up in clear
   and compelling ways. He brings in fight choreographers and sends his
   stars to study martial arts. He has a whole lot of ninjas in there. And
   yet the fight scenes are all indistinguishable blurs, full of shaky
   camerawork and choppy editing. This was the style at the time, and
   Nolan’s action scenes have gotten gradually better over the years, to
   the point where the aerial-dogfight scenes in last year’s Dunkirk are
   the best of their kind I’ve ever seen. But the Batman Begins fights are
   pure amateur hour. It drove me fucking nuts. How could this guy be so
   good at every aspect of action-movie filmmaking except for the actual
   action?

   But even with those quibbles, Batman Begins was a total eye-opener, a
   whole new vision of what a superhero movie could even be. Nolan has
   always had a way with mythic images, and some of the individual shots
   from Batman Begins will be with me forever: the taser harmlessly
   sparking off of Batman’s armor, or the bit where a helicopter camera
   swoops around Batman as he perches like a gargoyle on a Gotham spire.
   Nolan knew that just a little bit of veracity could go a long way. He
   knew that he could make Gotham look, more or less, like a real city,
   rather than a German-expressionist fantasyland. He knew he could cover
   plot holes with a few quick lines about Bruce Wayne using shell
   companies to buy his Batsuit’s components. And he knew that, with just
   a little bit of elbow grease, he could send moviegoers—grown adults who
   should really know better—out of the theater talking about how his
   Batman movie was realistic. That was a new thing.

   Other notable 2005 superhero movies: Christopher Nolan might’ve made
   launching a new superhero franchise look like an easy thing, but it’s
   apparently not that easy. Consider Tim Story’s first Fantastic Four
   movie, in which Marvel’s beloved interstellar-adventurer family comes
   to life in an incoherent flurry of bad jokes and worse CGI. The movie
   gave Chris Evans, then playing Johnny Storm, an early chance to flex
   his charm. But other than that, it’s a worthless,
   intelligence-insulting mess—exactly the sort of movie that, in its pure
   shittiness, underscores just how miraculous Batman Begins really was.

   It’s kind of a mess, but Francis Lawrence’s Constantine, based on a
   character that Alan Moore created, does a much better job at building a
   whole world and giving its hero some gravitas. As John Constantine,
   Keanu Reeves, in that weird career valley between the Matrix movies and
   John Wick, plays a sort of supernatural detective, hoping to cancel his
   own damnation by helping to keep the forces of Hell from overtaking
   Earth. It’s got the same overambitious plotting and bad CGI that plague
   so many of these movies, but it’s also got a great cast, including
   Tilda Swinton as a wayward angel and Shia LaBeouf as a Shia
   LaBeouf-esque loudmouth. (Also, Gavin Rossdale from Bush is in there?
   As a sexy demon?) And it takes its whole absurdity seriously.
   Constantine might also be the last big American studio movie to
   intentionally make smoking look cool. The cigarettes might be killing
   the main character, but he still gets to look cool while smoking them.
   (That same year, another Alan Moore story, the vaguely
   superhero-adjacent V For Vendetta, became a pretty okay movie.)

   For whatever reason, someone really thought that the bullshit-ass Ben
   Affleck Daredevil movie deserved a spinoff, and so we got Elektra. The
   movie isn’t nearly as bad as its reputation, and it’s sure as hell
   better than Daredevil. Elektra has some cool visual moments in with all
   the incoherent plotting, action, and CGI. But it does have the central
   problem of casting Jennifer Garner, a person who radiates niceness with
   every ounce of her being, as a cold-blooded ninja warrior. There are
   some problems you just can’t overcome.

   While superhero movies were becoming their own quasi-adult (or at least
   teenage) genre, 2005 did see the release of a few superhero movies for
   kids, like Sky High, the comedy about a school for teenage superheroes,
   or The Adventures Of Sharkboy And Lavagirl, Robert Rodriguez’s
   green-screen party about a kid whose superhero fantasies become
   reality. The Sci-Fi channel turned Man-Thing, Marvel’s tragic and
   silent swamp-monster hero, into a widely hated low-budget movie. Edward
   Furlong took over as the Crow in The Crow: Wicked Prayer, fighting
   David Boreanaz and Tara Reid and Tito Ortiz and Dennis Hopper in the
   character’s final straight-to-video movie. And Jamie Kennedy assumed
   the mantle of Jim Carrey in Son Of The Mask, a movie that I simply do
   not remember existing at all. Meanwhile, the non-superhero comics Sin
   City and A History Of Violence both became movies that were, in their
   own very different ways, iconic. I named my action-movie column after
   the latter, even though it wasn’t really an action movie.

   Next time: Bryan Singer tries to revive Richard Donner’s franchise with
   Superman Returns, and it goes badly in interesting ways.

   picks the most important superhero movie of every year, starting with
   the genre’s early big-budget moments and moving onto the
   multiplex-crushing monsters of today.

Batman (1989)

   For a little while there, people were shaving the Batman insignia into
   their hair. That’s the level of cultural dominance that Tim Burton’s
   Batman had going for it in the summer of 1989. Batman made a ton of
   money—over $400 million globally, in 1989 dollars—but that’s really
   only the half of it.

   People were so fired up about this movie that they wanted to become the
   movie somehow. Kids were quoting lines from the movie at each other on
   playgrounds before the movie had even come out, just from the TV
   commercials. Event movies arrive pretty routinely these days, but none
   of them feel like actual cultural events the way that Batman did. And
   as someone who was a kid at the time, I don’t even remember why.
   Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade made more money internationally that
   year, and I loved that movie, saw it twice in the theater. But it
   didn’t capture society’s imagination the same way, and it didn’t
   capture mine either.

   The funny thing about it—and now that I think about it, probably a big
   part of the reason for the excitement—was what a weird and personal
   movie Batman was. Burton didn’t grow up reading comic books, and so the
   Batman movie didn’t represent some childhood dream fulfilled for him.
   It was a job, a logical next step after he’d made visually distinctive
   hits out of Pee-wee’s Big Adventure and Beetlejuice. And yet Batman
   gave Burton a perfect excuse to go all the way big with his deeply
   inventive visual sensibility, to build a whole world out of it.

   In a lot of ways, Batman represents fairly pedestrian blockbuster
   filmmaking. The pacing is slow, the plotting occasionally incoherent.
   Too many of the action scenes are people wearing black clothes fighting
   in the dark, and you can’t see shit. There are plenty of sharp, fun
   character moments, but the movie still feels like it’s lumbering along
   to its inevitable explosive conclusion—a problem that’s haunted
   superhero movies ever since. But the thing that makes the movie stand
   out—the thing that all the critics at the time immediately commented
   on—was how the movie looked. Because no movie had ever really looked
   like that before.

   Burton’s version of Gotham City was a mad tangle of gothic
   architecture, a colossus designed by lunatics. Every building looms
   menacingly, and it’s hard to picture actual human beings living or
   working in any of those edifices. That works fine for Burton, who’s
   never, for the most part, been concerned with actual human beings.
   (That would change in Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood, but looking at
   the now-vast Burton filmography, those are the exceptions.) In Batman,
   characters talk like they know they’re in a movie, and Burton
   obligingly throws noir shadows over their faces, making them look as
   filmic and unreal as possible. And Jack Nicholson’s Joker makeup moves
   things into a whole new dimension of unreality, especially during the
   scenes when his Joker wears flesh-toned face paint to falsely give the
   idea that he’s a normal person.

   Batman came after a period of great inventiveness within comics, with
   writers like Alan Moore and Frank Miller using old, familiar characters
   to tell heady, transgressive stories about darkness and obsession and
   evil. Moore and Brian Bolland’s Batman story The Killing Joke was a key
   influence, and Burton has said it was what woke him up to the creative
   possibilities in comic book stories. In that story, the Joker kidnaps,
   injures, and humiliates Chief Gordon’s daughter in the hope that it’ll
   help drag Gordon into insanity. Batman ultimately stops him, but not
   before making it clear that Batman himself shares a healthy dose of
   that insanity. Burton, in turn, makes Batman into a figure of darkness
   and obsession, one with no concern for his own safety or even
   happiness. And he turns the Joker into a cackling, nearly motiveless
   agent of chaos. “I am the world’s first fully functioning homicidal
   artist,” Joker brags at one point, clearly proud of himself. For a
   movie explicitly marketed to children, this was pretty heavy stuff.

   But Batman is still, in a lot of ways, a genuine kids’ movie. In the
   opening scene, Batman breaks up a robbery and scares a couple of
   bumbling central-casting mugs, and as visually striking as it may be,
   it’s also deeply hokey. While Michael Keaton knew how to hit
   intimidating Batman poses, the fights themselves weren’t too much more
   elaborate than what Adam West had done on the deliberately silly old
   Batman TV show. And it’s full of slapsticky visual jokes that, as an
   actual child, I thought were pretty funny; I loved when the Joker took
   down the Batwing by pulling a revolver with a four-foot barrel out of
   his pants.

   Burton gave Jack Nicholson top billing, and watching the movie today,
   this was the right call. Nicholson’s Joker suffers in comparison to the
   iconic Heath Ledger version that came along years later, but he still
   absolutely eats up the screen. Early on, as sneering gangster Jack
   Napier, Nicholson grounds the movie, giving it a palpable real-world
   menace; his icy physicality is perfect. (I always loved that
   screenwriters Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren invented a character named
   Jack for Nicholson to play. It reminds me of all the movies where
   Jackie Chan plays a character named Jackie.)

   And as Joker, he does everything to not ground the movie, to push it
   into feverish insanity. He might rely on the frantic giggling a little
   too much, but the way he refuses to take the threat of Batman seriously
   is great. He’s in constant riff mode, but because it’s Nicholson, as
   opposed to someone like later riff-monster Batman villain Jim Carrey,
   the riffs carry a hint of menace and depravity. The scene in which the
   Joker and his boom-box goons invade an art museum and deface the
   paintings (a scene that Roger Ebert called “really vile”) is probably
   my favorite thing in the movie, mostly for the absurd chest-puffed
   dancing that the Joker does to Prince’s “Partyman.” (I also love the
   idea that the Joker used his crime-lord money to commission a Prince
   song about himself.)

   As Batman, Michael Keaton wasn’t the casting slam dunk that Nicholson
   was, but he’s a whole hell of a lot better than the two Batmen who
   would follow. When Keaton was first announced for the role, comic fans
   freaked out. Keaton was a former stand-up comic who’d really only been
   in comedies up to that point, so people assumed that Burton was going
   for the same sort of Bat-silliness as the Adam West show. And it’s true
   that Keaton isn’t remotely physically imposing, even in the Batman
   costume. But the confidence in his voice is great; as Batman, he lowers
   his voice without turning it into the death-metal whisper-growl that
   Christian Bale would later employ. As Bruce Wayne, meanwhile, he relies
   on an unforced natural charm without overdoing it. Burton’s clearly
   nowhere near as enamored of Batman as he is of the Joker, so Keaton
   doesn’t get as much to do. But Burton does get the idea that Batman
   himself is half a maniac. And when Keaton cuts loose in Vicki Vale’s
   apartment, reacting to the Joker’s menace with his own, Keaton at least
   gets to call back to the lunacy of Beetlejuice, a movie in which he’d
   been the Joker figure.

   Really, all three of the central performances are crucial to Batman’s
   success. Kim Basinger’s Vicki Vale is an underwritten part, but
   Basinger holds the movie together by coming across as the only halfway
   genuine human being in it. She reacts to all the insanity around her by
   projecting both trepidation and intrigue. And she sells the idea that
   she’s falling in love with squirrely-looking Keaton, which is just good
   acting. The entire movie hinges on the idea of the Joker seeing a photo
   of Vale and becoming obsessed. It’s a stretch, but it’s Kim Basinger,
   so you halfway buy it. “It’s as though we were made for each other:
   beauty and the beast,” he tells her. “Of course, if anyone else calls
   you beast, I’ll rip their lungs out.”

   Other than those three, all the characters are pretty one-note, and
   they come across with varying degrees of success. I like Jack Palance’s
   glib crime lord, mostly because it’s Palance, and Billy Dee Williams’
   Lando-esque take on Harvey Dent, mostly because it’s Williams. I could
   do without Robert Wuhl’s motormouthed reporter, even though it’s fun to
   watch him spread the myth of Batman: “They say he can’t be killed! They
   say he drinks blood!” And Michael Gough’s fusty Alfred Pennyworth and
   Pat Hingle’s huffing Commissioner Gordon are total nonfactors in the
   movie.

   As an early stab at a comic book superhero movie, one made by someone
   who hadn’t previously been a comic book fan, Batman gets a lot wrong.
   The scene in which Alfred, who seems to desperately want his boss to
   settle down, shows Vale into the Batcave is maybe the movie’s single
   greatest miscalculation. And one of the central tropes of Batman
   stories is that Batman refuses to kill people, so it’s a bit jarring to
   see the Batmobile raid on the chemical plant, where Batman appears to
   kill goons with bombs. Still, this wasn’t a case of a paychecking
   director treating his material with contempt, something that we’d see a
   whole lot more often in later years. It’s a great director—well, an
   at-the-time great director—zeroing in on the parts of the mythos that
   he finds fascinating and building a world out of those. With Marvel all
   but forcing directorial anonymity on its movies, at least until the
   past year or so, it’s oddly thrilling to see a big-budget superhero
   movie that’s so clearly a single person’s vision.

   Other notable 1989 superhero movies: Marvel was a long way away from
   becoming a cinematic juggernaut in 1989, and the best it could do was
   to turn The Punisher into a cheesy ’80s action movie. The first of
   three big-screen Punisher adaptations, the 1989 version stars Dolph
   Lundgren as a version of Frank Castle who avenges his family by
   fighting both mobsters and ninjas. Lundgren’s dark hair dye, which
   looks fucking terrible, is the only real concession to the comic book
   version of the story; Lundgren never even wears the iconic Punisher
   skull. But as a cheesy ’80s action movie, it’s pretty fun. I can’t hate
   a movie in which a gang of ninjas attacks the hero by zooming down an
   enormous funhouse slide.

   1989 also saw the release of the deeply silly sequel The Return Of The
   Swamp Thing, which ditched most of Wes Craven’s horror elements to tell
   a story about the Swamp Thing taking on an army of genetic-monster
   Un-Men. It’s a movie in which Heather Locklear falls in love with a
   giant plant-person, and the trailer includes the immortal line “He’s
   got a grudge because they turned him into sludge.”

   And speaking of genetic monsters, Troma made two different gory Z-grade
   Toxic Avenger sequels in 1989. In The Toxic Avenger Part II, Toxie
   visits Japan to gruesomely kill martial artists and take on an evil
   corporation. And in The Toxic Avenger Part III: The Last Temptation Of
   Toxie, Toxie takes a job as a spokesman for the evil corporation and
   ends up fighting Satan. Also, a school bus full of kids explodes.

   Next time: Twelve years before Spider-Man, Sam Raimi takes his first
   stab at telling a superhero story with 1990’s gloriously deranged
   Darkman.
