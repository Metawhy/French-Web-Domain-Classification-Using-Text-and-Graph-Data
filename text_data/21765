Transformative deals substantially aid the transition to OA. Let’s give them
the time they need to do so .

   Last month, Springer Nature agreed a new transformative ‘read and
   publish’ deal with the Norwegian library consortium, Unit.  This,
   coupled with renewals of existing deals in the UK (Jisc), Sweden
   (Bibsam) and Qatar, takes the number of such deals we have into double
   figures, the most of any publisher.  These deals enable researchers in
   these ten countries to publish open access in over 1900 Springer

The future of open access books

   Open access book publishing has been growing in recent years. The
   Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB) lists 2,099 open access books
   published in 2018, an increase of 38% from 2017. Funders are also
   starting to engage with open access for books: a small number of
   European funders now mandate open access for books and provide
   financial support for open access book publication. COAlition S has

   …my interactions with the editors and staff were really key. I want to
   emphasize that the handling editor played no small part in making this
   paper what it is now. He really went out of his way to provide feedback
   on framing and experiments to do in order to test certain
   hypotheses…the editor was key in making the story what it is. He is
   definitely part of this discovery.

お客様の声

   …my interactions with the editors and staff were really key. I want to
   emphasize that the handling editor played no small part in making this
   paper what it is now. He really went out of his way to provide feedback
   on framing and experiments to do in order to test certain
   hypotheses…the editor was key in making the story what it is. He is
   definitely part of this discovery.

   Michael M. Halassa, M.D., Ph.D.

   私たちはSpringer Book
   Archivesの導入により図書館サービスが強化され、学生や教員へさらに貢献できることを非常に喜んでいます。
   またアジアで初めてSBAを導入したことを誇りに思います。SBAは歴史的なコンテンツを豊富に有しており、このような貴重なリソースを必要とするユー
   ザーは多いと考えます。
