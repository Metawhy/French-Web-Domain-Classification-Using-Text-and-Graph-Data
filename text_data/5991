The New LVMH Chair: FUTURE of LUXURY

   Jointly created by ESSEC and the LVMH Group in 1991, the LVMH Chair is
   the longest-standing program worldwide specially dedicated to training
   young talents for careers in the luxury industry.

   The new format of the LVMH Chair is highly innovative as it adds
   exclusive digital content to its offer. Through the digital content,
   open to all ESSEC students across 3 campuses and across programs,
   students will be able to immerse themselves in the world of luxury and
   the LVMH ecosystem, travelling through métiers and each step of the
   value chain: from design and creation, to brand management, supply
   chain and manufacturing, digital transformation and entrepreneurship,
   and client excellence.

   For those students who get accepted into the face-to-face component of
   the LVMH Chair, they will discover that the Chair offers students a
   unique program that integrates theoretical knowledge through courses
   given by ESSEC professors and practical expertise through seminars
   given by LVMH managers. The guest lectures given by the LVMH managers
   are the highlight for many LVMH Chair students as they are exposed to
   various LVMH Houses and topics, ranging from launching a new fragrance
   to managing the digital strategy of a luxury brand to dealing with
   supply chain challenges to meet customer expectations. The face-to-face
   component of the LVMH Chair also provides participants with hands-on
   experience through exclusive company visits and field projects.

   Finally, being part of the LVMH Chair also means joining the luxury
   community at ESSEC. The chair alumni community is very active and
   involved in organising events several times per year. In addition, our
   alumni are recognized all over the world and extremely well represented
   in the luxury industry.
   The website will give you additional information about the Chair and
   its contents. Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to
   contact us via email: lvmhchair@essec.edu
   Please sign up to our exclusive digital platform
