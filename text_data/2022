   Dr. Li

The Arc of an Idea

   Dr. Silva has developed a hypothesis about a novel shear wall design
   that he believes will mitigate damage from earthquakes, thereby
   decreasing the number of buildings that have to be closed following an
   earthquake. He will soon begin testing his design in the Science and
   Engineering Hall’s high bay.
