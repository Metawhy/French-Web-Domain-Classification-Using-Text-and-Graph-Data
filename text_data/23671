Harvey Hotels & Restaurants on Route 66

   Though the famous Harvey House lunch rooms, restaurants, and hotels
   pre-dated Route 66 there were many decades where the two happily
   co-existed. But, change is inevitable and ironically, Route 66, was in
   part, responsible for the death of this famous chain. As the roads got

   Did You Know?

   Rip Van Winkle and his dog by Thomas Nast, 1880

   From the beginning of time, people have told stories — regaling their
   friends and families with tales of adventure, hard times, interesting
   people, frightening experiences and everyday life. Sometimes these were
   truths, others were exaggerations, and occasionally, they were nothing
   more than tall tales.

   American History is filled with folklore, Native American mythology,
   and real truths that make for wonderful campfire tales. In these
   stories, much like earlier European, Greek, and Roman tales, the
   accounts can often be only be guessed at, as to whether they are fact
   or fiction, but they continue to make the rounds of new generations.

Abbot Downing Company – Makers of the Concord Stage


   Abbot Downing Company

   Abbot Downing Company

   Abbot Downing Company (1827-1847, 1865-1919) – Lewis Downing, a
   wheelwright, had been in the wagon building business in Concord, New
   Hampshire since 1813, but in 1826, he saw the need for a new type of
   road coach. Requiring the skills of an expert coach body builder,
   Downing soon partnered with a man named J. Stephens Abbot, forming a
   new company called Abbott and Downing in 1827. Though the organization
   actually manufactured over 40 different types of  carriages and wagons,
   they became world renowned for their Concord Stagecoach. Their
   stagecoaches were built solid, quickly gained a reputation for not
   breaking down, and rode more smoothly due to a design feature called
   the thoroughbrace.
   Concord Stage

   Concord Stage

   This leather strap of many layers supported the body of the stagecoach,
   enabling it to swing back and forth and absorb the shocks of the road.
   Over the years, thousands coaches were produced and sent all over the
   world, its basic design changing very little.

   After twenty years in business together, Abbot and Downing went their
   separate ways in an amicable split. However, the separate companies
   both continued to build Concord Coaches. When Lewis Downing retired in
   1865, his sons took over and soon merged once again with the Abbot
   Company, manufacturing coaches, carriages and wagons under the name of
   Abbott-Downing until 1919.

Chicago and North Western Railroad


   Chicago and Northwestern RR Caboose, 1943

   Chicago and Northwestern RR Caboose, 1943

   Chicago and North Western Railroad, C&NW (1859-1995) – Sometimes simply
   known as the North Western Railroad, the original line was chartered by
   the legislatures of Wisconsin and Illinois on June 7, 1859, after
   purchasing the bankrupt Chicago, St. Paul and Fond du Lac Railroad,
   which began in 1855. Six years later, in February 1865, it officially
   merged with the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad, which had been
   chartered on January 16, 1836. Continuing to invest, the line owned a
   majority of stock in the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha
   Railway by 1882.

   For many years, the railroad company picked up other smaller lines and
   by 1910, when it reached its peak, it was probably the largest and most
   profitable of the Midwestern railroads.

   Though the automobile had much-reduced railroad travel by this time,
   the company still continued on. In January 1958, it finalized the
   acquisition of the Litchfield and Madison Railroad, in November of
   1960, it acquired the rail properties of the 1,500-mile Minneapolis and
   St. Louis Railway.

   It officially leased the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha
   Railway (Omaha Road), and merged it into the North Western in 1972.
   Mergers and acquisitions continued until the railroad finally ceased to
   exist when it was acquired by the Union Pacific Railroad in April 1995.
   At its peak, the railroad operated more than 5,000 miles of track in
   seven states.
