About me

   Starting with October 2019 I am a permanent researcher (Chargé de
   recherche (CR)) at the STARS team at INRIA Méditerranée in Sophia
   Antipolis, France, where I have been since 2014.
   My research is in computer vision and image processing. My latest
   results deal with health monitoring and specifically with facial
   dynamics recognition in Alzheimer's disease patients.
   I am also interested and involved in other areas, such as combining
   image processing and statistics towards analysis and algorithmic design
   of soft biometrics systems, video surveillance systems, beauty
   estimation, as well as the impact of facial cosmetics on automated
   biometric systems.

News

     * I was interviewed for an article in Science et Vie on facial
       analysis, see the full article here.

     * We recceived a Best Poster Award at the 14th IEEE International
       Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG 2019) in
       Lille, France (the flagship face analysis conference) for the
       paper: "Robust remote heart rate estimation from face utilizing
       spatial-temporal attention" authored by Xuesong Niu, Xingyuan Zhao,
       Hu Han, Abhijit Das, Antitza Dantcheva, Shiguang Shan and Xilin
       Chen.

     * The ANR - DFG Project RESPECT launched.

     * We (Shiguang Shan (Chinese Academy of Sciencces, China), Hu Han
       (Chinese Academy of Sciencces, China), Abhijit Das (Inria, France),
       Antitza Dantcheva (Inria, France)) are organizing the Robust Tattoo
       Detection and Retrieval Competition (RTDRC 2019) associated to the
       10th IEEE International Conferencce on Biometrics: Theory,
       Applications and Systems (BTAS 2019).

     * We (Wael Abd-Almageed (USC, USA), Antitza Dantcheva (Inria,
       France), Sebastien Marcel (Idiap, Switzerland)) are organizing a
       special session on The Future of Biometrics beyond Recognition and
       Anti-Spoofing at the 12th IAPR International Conference on
       Biometrics (ICB'19). For details, see here.

     * I was interviewed for an aticle in Charlie Hebdo on facial
       recognition, see the full article here.

     * We (Abhijit Das (Inria, France), Hu Han (Chinese Academy of
       Sciencces, China), Antitza Dantcheva (Inria, France), Francois
       Bremond (Inria, France), Xilin Chen (Chinese Academy of Sciences,
       China)) are organizing a special session on human health monitoring
       based on computer vision at the 14th IEEE International Conference
       on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG'19). For details,
       see here.

     * We (Abhijit Das, Antitza Dantcheva, Francois Bremond) won the
       ECCV'18 challenge on bias estimation in face analysis (BEFA). The
       challenge placed focus on a pertinent, but largely neglected issue
       - the biasness of face analytics datasets, with respect to factors
       such as age, gender, ethnicity, pose and resolution. In order to
       progress toward balanced face recognition and attribute estimation
       truly in the wild, the BEFA - challenge introduced a well-balanced
       dataset across multiple factors: age, gender, ethnicity, pose and
       resolution and requested for algorithms to estimate biases.
       We proposed a Multi-Task Convolutional Neural Network (MTCNN)
       algorithm that jointly learned gender, age and ethnicity by a loss
       function involving joint dynamic loss weight adjustment and was
       successful, as well as relatively unbiased in estimating age,
       gender and ethnicity. More details here.

     * We found a Ph.D. student in the area of Computer Vision and Deep
       Learning applied to Facial Analysis in invisibe spectra.

     * We are organizing a special session on mobile biometrics at the 9th
       international conference on biometrics: theory, applications and
       systems (BTAS'18). For details, see here.

     * My Inria - Chinese Academy of Sciences joint research project
       FER4HM launched, see here.

     * My ANR JCJC research project ENVISION launched, see the related
       website here.

     * I was interviewed for an aticle in Le Monde on biometrics, see the
       full article here.
