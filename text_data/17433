What's New at <intent>

     * the next big ancillary

The Next Big Ancillary: The untapped potential of media revenue for airlines
       Travel brands are full-fledged retailers, including airlines.
       Forrester has said it, and now the IATA has declared it, too.
       Ancillary revenue is expected to reach close to $100 billion in
       2019, with even more growth in 2020. There’s a massive opportunity
       for airlines to think more like retailers. To better serve, upsell
       and monetize their users like retailers. It doesn’t have to be just
       more of the same. In fact, it can be easier, and more lucrative.
