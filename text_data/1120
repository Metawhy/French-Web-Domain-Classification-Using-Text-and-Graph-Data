   As we head into 2015, we wanted to take a look back at the significant
   RapidIO.org related events of 2014.  As you’ll see, the RapidIO.org
   community was very active with several key initiatives underway as well
   as several new members joining the community.

   Here are 3 key highlights from the year (a full listing of all the 2014
   activity follows the 3 highlights):
     * RapidIO is being used in HPC analytics with the production release
       of the HP Moonshot Proliant m800 cartridge which leverages TI’s ARM
       based Keystone II DSPs clustered over a RapidIO 2D torus unified
       fabric.  PayPal is using this platform for real time analytics
       processing. RapidIO based Analytics at PayPal

     * Through the strong commitment of our Technical Working Group
       contributors, the RapidIO 10xN 3.1 Specification was released last
       October bringing additional High Availability and Fault Tolerant
       extensions to the current RapidIO specification in order to address
       critical system performance needs of Military and Aerospace
       applications and support the Next Generation Space Interconnect
       Standard (NGSIS) RapidIO.org releases revision 3.1 of the RapidIO
       10xN Specification Stack

     * At the Linley Processor Conference in October, RapidIO.org
       announced the formation of new task group with the mandate to
       develop an open specification for multi-node / core coherent scale
       out of 64-bit ARM processors using RapidIO as a coherent unified
       fabric.  The formation of this task group saw AMD and ARM join the
       RapidIO.org community to contribute to this effort.  RapidIO.org
       announces ARM 64-bit Coherent Scale Out Task Group to Specify
       RapidIO as a Unified Coherent Fabric for Data Center Analytics and

   AUSTIN, TEXAS, NOVEMBER 18, 2015 A3Cube®, a leading provider of
   hyper-converged solutions, announced at SuperComputing15 a new
   Hardware-accelerated Software Defined System (HSDS™) architected
   utilizing Dell OEM solutions including Dell PowerEdge R730xd servers.
   Fortissimo transforms a computing rack into a powerful bare metal
   converged system and ultra-low latency shared storage unit, eliminating
   the need for traditional external storage resources and providing
   unmatchable performance in any application, including virtualization
   and data analytics.
   A3CUBE strongly believes that the era of traditional High Performance
   Computing is going to end and be replaced by a new era of High
   Performance Data, where data access becomes even more important than
   computational power. What really makes the difference in all modern
   activities is the velocity and efficiency in which you can access and
   analyze an increasingly large amount of data. Harnessing Dell
   technology, development and deployment expertise, A3CUBE’s
   revolutionary communication technology will deliver industry-leading
   networked computing and storage solutions to customers worldwide.
   According to this vision, A3CUBE realized Fortissimo Foundation, a
   Hardware-accelerated Software Defined System (HSDS™) that follows a
   radically new approach to Data Access. It’s a modular system whose
   physical building block is a server equipped with storage and an A3CUBE
   PCIe Intelligent NIC. More building blocks (servers) can be clustered
   together to form a global direct-remote I/O access system that linearly
   scales server performance, I/O bandwidth, memory, flash and hard disk
   storage capacity. The result is a scale-out solution where the DRAM
   becomes the permanent home for data, transforming your system in an “In
   memory” solution without using specialized software.
   Fortissimo transforms a computing rack into a powerful bare metal
   converged system and ultra-low latency shared storage unit, eliminating
   the need for traditional external storage resources and providing
   unmatchable performance in any application, including virtualization
   and data analytics.
   On the contrary of any other equivalent system, it uses only RDMA
   mechanism (direct memory to memory) to exchange data between the
   different components of the cluster and completely eliminates the use
   of metadata, providing real linear scalability and dramatic
   improvements in application performance and datacenter efficiency,
   particularly in unstructured, Big Data environments.
   Fortissimo Foundation permits to accelerate any application,
   eliminating the needs and the risks of “in-memory” applications
   migration. Appliances can be substituted using your standard software
   (no migration, no risks) with Fortissimo. Hadoop or any large dataset
   can run directly in-memory with a real file system (Replication,
   Failover, deduplication and compression) taking huge advantage of the
   A3CUBE Inter Cluster communication, up to 100 times faster than
   existing commercial approaches.
   “In response to the explosive growth in the hyper-converged market
   place, Dell OEM is pleased to support A3Cube’s powerful converged
   platform in the new emerging ‘Fast Data’ market. The combination of our
   Dell PowerEdge R730xd servers, with the advanced storage and analytics
   architecture developed by A3Cube, delivers impressive computational
   performance,” said Ron Pugh, executive director and general manager,
   Dell OEM Solutions.
   The flexibility of configuration of Dell PowerEdge servers permits any
   combination of memory, flash, SSD, hard disk, CPU or data center I/O
   fabric providing investment protection and cost savings.
   “We tested different OEM solutions to find the best platform suited to
   extoll the whole potential of Fortissimo Foundation. Dell OEM solutions
   meet all the FORTISSIMO requirements, excelling in term of performance,
   size, storage capacity, flexibility and expandability”, said Antonella
   Rubicco, CEO of A3CUBE. “We are very impressed and satisfied with the
   platform and level of competence and collaboration we have found with
   Dell”.

       release of the Phase 1 specification at last month’s Open Server
       Summit in Santa Clara, CA. The final specification describes a
       functionality optimized CPU agnostic compute/motherboard fitted in
       a 19” 1U enclosure, with OCP compatible 21” form-factor option.
       Thanks to adding multiple SFP and QSFP cages, users may choose
       between electrical or optical interface for connections to the
       outside world. The system also has local SSD storage capabilities,
       for the most flexible system configurations where storage is
       necessary.

   The specification incorporates 10GbE next to RapidIO which will be
   exposed to an SFP cage. It enables RapidIO to gracefully work with
   existing datacenter 10GbE infrastructure (top of rack / spine switch)
   without any additional needs.

   Thanks to the close collaboration between the DCCN members the task
   group was able to deliver a frozen specification and the start of Phase
   1 development in less than six months. This is a great achievement and
   is promising for future developments.
