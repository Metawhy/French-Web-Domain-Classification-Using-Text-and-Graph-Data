   A component-oriented framework for creating highly scalable web
   applications in Java.

Java Power

   Tapestry pages and components are simple Java POJOs, with easy access
   to all Java language features and the vast Java ecosystem. Thanks to
   Java's advanced concurrency API, Tapestry handles requests fast without
   sacrificing security or stability.

Scripting Ease

   Tapestry features live class reloading: change your Java code, refresh
   the browser and see the changes... instantly! Have your cake and eat it
   too: the speed and depth of Java, the agile development style of Ruby
   or Python.

Super Productivity

    Simple POJO classes, streamlined templates, live class reloading,
   state-of-the-art exception reporting, first-class Ajax support, and a
   big library of built-in components: Tapestry is designed from the
   ground up to give you great productivity.

   We think you will love Tapestry! Give us 20 minutes and follow our
   quickstart guide.


What is Tapestry?

Pure Java and Polyglot

   Written in pure Java: code your pages and components in Java, Groovy or
   Scala.

Highly Productive

   Live class reloading means that the time between seeing an error and
   providing the fix is seconds, not minutes.

Advanced Exception Reporting

   Gives you all the tools you need to fix your problem: not just a stack
   trace, but details about what Tapestry was doing and why, what went
   wrong, and how to fix it.

Fast

   Pure Java; no reflection, not even for property expressions. Built to
   cleanly support large numbers of concurrent threads without contention.
   Integrated GZip content compression, JavaScript aggregation and
   compression, and client-side caching.

Convention over Configuration

   Dependency injection and meta-programming through annotations and
   naming conventions.

Scalable

   Scales up big on a single server, and works great in a cluster. Keeps
   session state minimal by design.

Testable

   Committed to testability throughout design; built-in utilities to
   enhance TDD. Support for Selenium for integration testing.

Adaptable and Modular

   Architecture is open and extensible. There's a clean way to add your
   own extensions, or override built-in logic. Provides integration with
   Hibernate, JPA and Spring. Third-party integrations with other tools,
   such as Quartz and Lucene.
