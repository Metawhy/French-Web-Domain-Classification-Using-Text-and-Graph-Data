   What is EmTech Europe?

   Since ancient times, technology has acted as a catalyst for societal
   revolution. This phenomena has been especially prevalent in recent
   years as technological advances and applications in several fields have
   radically transformed the way we interact and behave on a daily basis.

   We believe that the current shift transforming contemporary society
   began many years ago through emerging research and technologies
   resulting in the technological advancements we are experiencing today.

   Without the development of early programming structures and the
   creation of computational devices, it would have been impossible to
   develop AI or Quantum Computers. For the 2018 edition of EmTech Europe,
   we want the focus of this year’s event to be on the importance of
   continuous technological transformation. This event acknowledges
   contributions from past and current pioneers, founders, and developers
   in fields of emerging technologies and research from leading
   institutions.

   Those who attend EmTech Europe will be equipped with the necessary
   information required to understand how becoming the society of today
   will pave the way to becoming the society of the future.

A world shaped by technology – #WrapUp Nº 14

   September 27, 2017 | Uncategorized

   The #WrapUps are posts that summarize the ins and outs of the startup &
   innovation and tech ecosystem. Stay tuned for more news on our blog!


Urban Drone Deliveries Are Finally Taking Flight.

   Swiss cities will soon have delivery drones zipping through their
   airspace. Drone startup Matternet has announced that it will start
   using a network of robotic quadcopters to make deliveries to hospitals
   in urban areas across Switzerland later this year.

   The scheme, which is claimed to be the first to fly such deliveries
   over densely populated areas, makes use of an automated landing station
   to accept packages and release them to approved recipients. Senders pop
   goods into a purpose-designed packing case, which is then sucked into
   the base and maneuvered by robot arm into the drone. After the aircraft
   has flown itself to its destination, at the other end users must scan a
   QR code sent to their phone to grab the goods. You can watch a
   (painfully corporate) video of it in action, if you want. Initially
   Matternet will deliver blood and pathology samples—not unlike the rural
   Africa service currently offered by Zipline that we’ve written about in
   the past. Other drone delivery trials have flirted with urban
   deliveries, but the closest that any company had really got until now
   was Flytrex, with its shipping of groceries across a bay in Reykjavik.
   Sadly for Americans, regulations still stand in the way of similar
   schemes on U.S. shores for now.

Governments Are Testing Their Own Cryptocurrencies

   Bitcoin-like money may emerge in countries where cash is in decline or
   financial networks need updating.
   The people of Sweden are breaking up with cash. The number of banknotes
   and coins in circulation has fallen to its lowest level in three
   decades. Riksbank, Sweden’s central bank, estimates that cash
   transactions made up only 15 percent of all retail transactions last
   year, down from 40 percent in 2010, thanks in large part to massively
   popular mobile payment services. But a cryptocurrency that’s available
   to all consumers “opens up a whole host of issues” and would pose new
   challenges for makers of monetary policy, says Rod Garratt, an
   economics professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

   First, there’s the question of who, exactly, should verify the
   transactions and maintain the distributed ledger. Even if that’s
   solved, the new system would be, in a sense, too streamlined, making it
   easier for bank runs to occur in a moment of crisis or panic. In most
   current financial systems, large-scale withdrawals of funds are
   naturally slowed by the time it takes for a central bank to produce the
   paper money people are demanding. But if the currency is purely
   digital, no such brakes exist—a panicked citizenry could empty their
   accounts almost instantly, leaving an entire country’s banking system
   all but penniless.

In China, Robot Dentists Are Implanting 3-D Printed Teeth

   Open wide, because the robots have eyes on your dental work. South
   China Morning Post reports that a robo-dentist has autonomously
   implanted two new, 3-D-printed teeth into a woman’s mouth. The
   procedure, which appears to have made use of a robot arm from Universal
   Robotics, was developed by a team from the Fourth Military Medical
   University and Beihang University.

   The hardware first orients itself with the patient’s head, and is then
   programmed with the procedure it needs to undertake. It does a dry run
   to check that it’s got everything right, before the patient is given an
   anesthetic and the robot gets drilling. The team says that the robot
   works to tolerances of less than 0.3 millimeters, and can detect and
   compensate for movements of the person’s head. Don’t fancy the idea?
   Well, bear in mind that it’s hoped the robot will be able to make up
   for a shortfall in the number of practicing dentists in China, which
   often leads to unqualified practitioners performing questionable
   procedures.

This Cable Will Boggle Your Mind With the Highest Data Capacity Ever to Cross
the Atlantic

   The new undersea link, which stretches 4,100 miles between Virginia
   Beach, Virginia, and Bilbao, Spain, can stream 71 million HD videos
   simultaneously. Known as Marea, it was laid as a joint venture between
   Microsoft, Facebook, and telco infrastructure firm Telxius, and will
   enter operation in 2018.
   The cable, which in total weighs more than 10.25 million pounds and is
   apparently the highest-capacity subsea cable to ever cross the
   Atlantic, can shuttle a bewildering 160 terabits of data per second.
   Microsoft explains just what a feat of engineering is required to lay
   such a cable.

   The project required charting a course with average depths of almost
   11,000 feet and hazards ranging from active volcanoes and earthquake
   zones to coral reefs. The cable, which is about 1.5 times the diameter
   of a garden hose, contains eight pairs of fiber optic cables encircled
   by copper, a hard-plastic protective layer and a waterproof coating.
   Some portions closer to shore are buried to protect the cable from
   fishing and ship traffic, but for most of its route, the cable lays on
   the ocean floor.

Wireless Gadget Charging Just Got a Range Boost

   Your phone could soon get juiced over the air from a foot away. That’s
   thanks to the work of a new startup called Pi. Founded by two MIT
   graduates, it has developed a wireless charger that uses a honed
   version of inductive charging to send power further than previous
   versions of the technology.

   For those unfamiliar, inductive charging is straightforward in theory.
   A system sets up an alternating electromagnetic field, and then an
   induction coil in (or attached to) a smaller device harvests power from
   it. Until now, commercially available wireless gadget charging has
   required you to place a device on something like a charging mat, but Pi
   has developed some fancy math that allows it to quickly detect a gadget
   then shape its magnetic fields to target power to devices up to 12
   inches away.

   According to TechCrunch the device, which is the truncated cone in the
   image above, can juice five phone or tablets at once (no laptops for
   now), with the rate of charge falling as a device moves away from it.
   It will cost under $200 when it goes on sale in 2018. Let’s hope it
   works well in the home: as we’ve reported before, other long-range
   wireless chargers have flopped before they’ve been launched as real
   products.
