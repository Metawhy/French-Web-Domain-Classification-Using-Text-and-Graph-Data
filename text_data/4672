   Display maker revving up for ‘C Project’
   Samsung Display's Asan 1 Campus in South Chungcheong Province, South
   Korea. Samsung Display's Asan 1 Campus in South Chungcheong Province,
   South Korea.

   Samsung Display has shut down the operations of some of its production
   lines for Gen-8 (2200㎜ x 2500㎜) LCDs, according to industry sources on
   Aug. 13.

   The move, they said, appears to be a part of the so-called ‘C Project,’
   involving a gradual shift towards large-sized TV OLED panels. The
   purchase orders for the necessary equipment is expected for October,
   the sources added.

   The line that has been stopped is the 8-1 line phase 1 in Samsung
   Display’s Asan 1 Campus in South Chungcheong Province. The line has
   been in operation since the latter half of 2007, when the Samsung unit
   was running a joint venture with Japan’s Sony. The Gen-8 lines in the
   Asan 1 Campus are divided into the 8-1 and 8-2 lines, which are each
   divided into phase 1 and phase 2.

   “In its next step, Samsung Display is set to shut down the rest of the
   Gen-8 lines, along with the 7-2 lines left after switching most of them
   to produce small and mid-sized OLED panels,” said a sources close to
   the matter.

   When all of this happens, the display maker will no longer be running
   LCD lines on its home turf.
   Overseas, Samsung Display operates Gen-8 LCD production lines in
   China’s Suzhou City. Samsung owns a 60% stake in the production
   corporation SSL, while the Suzhou City government owns another 30%.
   Another 10% is owned by Chinese display maker CSOT.

   Even if Samsung Display halts its entire local LCD lines, it can secure
   all the TV LCD panels it needs from its Chinese lines and CSOT,
   according to market watchers.

   Samsung Display holds a 9.8% stake in CSOT’s Gen-11 (2940㎜x3370㎜) LCD
   lines’ production corporation.

   The Gen-11 LCD lines at CSOT began mass production in the first quarter
   of this year, and it’s aiming to increase its production capacity to
   its fullest of a monthly 90,000 by the end of the year. About a tenth
   of the panels produced here is set aside for Samsung Display.

   On the day Samsung display partially halted its Gen-8 LCD lines, local
   display equipment maker ICD said in a regulatory filing that it has
   entered into a supply contract with Japanese panel deposition equipment
   maker Canon Tokki.

   Industry watchers believe this signals that Samsung Display has
   indirectly signed to install deposition equipment for its large-sized
   TV OLED panels. ICD has been supplying logistics chambers for Canon
   Tokki’s small and mid-sized panel deposition equipment.

   The 50.1 billion won contract between ICD and Canon Tokki is set to
   expire in June of 2020. This means Samsung Display’s plans to bring in
   the Canon Tokki equipment by March next year may have been a bit
   delayed.

   Meanwhile, another equipment maker that is to supply the C Project said
   that purchase orders are being postponed from October from the
   initially planned August.
