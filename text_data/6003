MΞDISIM

   MΞDISIM (also possibly spelled M3DISIM and pronounced like "medicine"
   with a final "m") is an Inria project-team, joint with Ecole
   Polytechnique, part of LMS (Laboratoire de Mécanique des Solides,
   Ecole Polytechnique  - UMR7649 CNRS/INSIS - Institut Polytechnique de
   Paris), and affiliated with the Inria Saclay Ile-de-France Research
   Center on the Ecole Polytechnique campus.

   Our team aims at proposing novel mathematical and numerical methods and
   tools in the realm of the biomechanical modeling of tissues and organs,
   with a non-exclusive focus on the cardiovascular system. Our intended
   contributions thus comprise: (1) modeling components per se,
   individually and within coupling relations; (2) inverse problem
   methodologies, in order to benefit from the various available data to
   compensate for the many uncertainties inherent to such natural systems;
   (3) numerical procedures specifically formulated – and analysed – to be
   effective for the types of direct and inverse problems considered; and
   (4) experimental studies and clinical applications, carried out both
   within the team and through various collaborations, in relation to the
   above modeling objectives. This is by construction a multidisciplinary
   enterprise, at the crossroads of applied mathematics, mechanics,
   bioengineering, and medical applications.

   Our work on cardiac modelling, in particular, exemplifies our approach.
   We have formulated a multi-scale 3D model of the cardiac mechanical
   contraction responding to electrical activation. By integrating this
   formulation with specially-designed numerical methods, we are able to
   represent the whole organ behavior in interaction with the blood during
   heart beats. This achievement required a deep understanding of the
   underlying physics and physiology on the one hand, and expertise for
   proposing well-posed mathematical formulations and adequate numerical
   discretizations, on the other hand. Furthermore, the need for
   validating and calibrating models, and for designing patient-specific
   models for prediction purposes in clinical applications, has motivated
   some further fundamental research on estimation and data assimilation.
   We have thus proposed and analysed some original estimation methods
   well-adapted to the types of models and data (e.g. medical imaging) at
   hand.

   For more details and news, our latest annual activity report is
   available online.
