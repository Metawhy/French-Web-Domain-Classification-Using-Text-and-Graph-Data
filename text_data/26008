Visiting this website

   You may visit our website without revealing any personal information.
   We collect only access data in the so-called server log files, such as
   e.g. name of the requested file, IP address, date and time of the
   processing request, volume of data transmitted, and the requesting
   provider. These data will be used exclusively to ensure a smooth
   operation of the website and analysed for the purpose of improving our
   website and then deleted. They do not allow us to identify you.

Cookies

   To improve the user experience on our website and enable you to use its
   certain features, some pages of this website use the so-called cookies.
   A cookie is a small text file stored in your web browser while browsing
   it, which records certain settings and entered information to share it
   with our system through your browser.

   Some of the cookies we use are deleted after you close the browser
   session, i.e. when you close the browser (that’s the so-called session
   cookies). Other cookies are stored in your end-user device and enable
   us to recognise your browser when you visit us again (persistent
   cookies).

   Cookies do not collect any personal data and thus, they do not identify
   you as an individual user. Please note that some cookies are created as
   soon as you come to our website. You can configure your browser for it
   to inform you whenever a page uses cookies and decide on a case-by-case
   basis whether to accept or reject the cookies on a given page or
   generally. Please note that disabling cookies may limit your access to
   some features of our website.

   Below we present information on cookies we use and how you can
   customise your browser in that respect.

   1. Necessary cookies

   These cookies are necessary to enable you to use our website. This
   includes e.g. cookies that enable you to log into the customer area or
   add items to your shopping cart.

   2. Analytical / performance cookies

   our website. We analyse them e.g. to improve the functionality of our
   website and recommend you products that will be interesting to you.

   3. Functionality cookies

   These cookies are used for certain features of our website, e.g. to
   improve the website’s navigation, or deliver to you customised and
   relevant information (e.g.  ads that match your interests).

   4. Targeting cookies

   These cookies record information about your visit to the website,
   previously viewed pages and links you clicked. We use this information
   to tailor our website and displayed ads to your interests.

   5. Third-party cookies

   The cookies of some of our advertising providers help make the on-line
   offering and our website more attractive to you. Therefore, cookies of
   our partner providers are also saved to your hard disk when you are
   visiting our website. These are temporary cookies and are automatically
   deleted after a specific timeframe. As a rule, cookies of our partner
   providers are deleted a few days or up to 24 months later, or in some
   cases after several years. Cookies of our partner providers do not
   collect personal data, either. They will collect exclusively
   pseudonymised data under a user ID. These pseudonymised data will not
   be associated with your personal data at any time.

   use Google Tag Manager. The Tag Manager tool alone is a domain that
   does not use cookies and does not record any personal data. It is
   rather that the tool enables firing other tags which then record data
   from time to time (for more information, see above). If you disable a
   tag on the domain or cookie level, all tracking tags implemented within
   Google Tag Manager will be disabled.

Facebook, Google+ and Twitter social plugins

   Some sections of our website  use the so-called social plugins
   (”plugins”) of social networks such as Facebook and Google+ and the
   micro-blogging service Twitter. These services are provided by Facebook
   Inc., Google Inc. and Twitter Inc. (”Providers”).

   Facebook is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo
   Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”). For an overview of Facebook plugins
   and to see how they look go to:
   https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins.

   Google+ is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain
   View, CA 94043, USA (”Google”). For an overview of Google plugins and
   to see how they look go to:  https://developers.google.com/+/plugins

   Twitter is operated by Twitter Inc., 1355 Market St, Suite 900, San
   Francisco, CA 94103. For an overview of Twitter buttons and to see how
   they look go to: https://twitter.com/about/resources/buttons

   To increase the level of protection of your data during your visit to
   our website, the site uses the so-called “2 click solution“ plugins
   from Heise Online. This ensures that when you call a page of our
   website, which contains such plugins, no link to the servers of
   Facebook, Google and Twitter is established yet.

   Your browser will establish the direct link only when you enable the
   plugins and thus consent to the transfer of your data to the said
   service providers, partly headquartered in the USA.

   The content of the plugin is then transferred by the relevant Provider
   directly to your browser and integrated with the page you are viewing.
   This allows the Providers to obtain information that you viewed the
   page of our website in your browser, also if you do not have an account
   with the relevant Provider or are currently not signed in. This
   information (including your IP address) will be sent from your browser
   directly to the relevant Provider’s servers in the USA and stored
   there.

   If you have signed in to your social network account, the Providers
   will be able to directly attribute your site visit to your Facebook or
   Google+ account. If you interact with the plugins, e.g. click the Like,
   +1 or the Tweet button or leave a comment, the relevant information
   will be also transmitted directly to the relevant Provider’s server and
   stored there. In addition, the information will be published on your
   social network or Twitter account and your contacts will be able to see
   it.

   To find out more about the purpose and scope of collection, further
   processing and use of the data by the Providers, and to learn about
   your rights in this respect and how you can customise your browser to
   better protect your privacy, please see the data privacy policies of
   the Providers.

   Facebook Data Policy
   Google Privacy Policy
   Twitter Privacy Policy

   If you do not want Google, Facebook or Twitter to link the data
   collected through our website directly to your account, you should sign
   out of the relevant account before you enable the plugins.

   You may also use add-ons for your browser to stop the plugins, e.g.
   Facebook plugins can be blocked by “Facebook Blocker”.

Contact form

   Your personal data will be collected if you voluntarily supply them to
   us when contacting us or during the registration for our services. We
   use your data solely to be able to offer you the information and
   services you request, which means that we will store and process only
   the data and information that are absolutely necessary to respond to
   your enquiry or execute an agreement.

   If you contact us but did not sign a membership agreement, we will
   delete your data from our customer database if you request us to.

   Live-Chat-Tool Userlike

   If you use the Live Chat Tool to contact us, the data you voluntarily
   supply there (name, email address, message) will be stored by our
   service provider Userlike on servers in Germany and processed there by
   us solely for the purpose of responding to your enquiry, and then they
   will be deleted. Userlike will not use the supplied data for purposes
   other than those stated above.

Leaving a comment (regarding blog posts)

   We will collect your personal data if you voluntarily supply them to us
   in form of leaving a comment regarding a blog post. We use the data
   supplied by you without your separate consent solely for the purpose of
   publishing your comment, whereas your email will not be published and
   your name will be linked to your website if you specified one.

Subscribing to the newsletter

   If you subscribe to one of our newsletters, we will use the data you
   supply with your express consent to send you our newsletter. You must
   provide your e-mail address, all other information is voluntary. The
   newsletter includes the latest posts and offers of Trusted Shops GmbH
   and third-party providers. You may cancel your subscription at any
   time.

   If you subscribe to our newsletter, we will pass your data necessary
   for the sending of the newsletter to a service provider who will be
   commissioned to handle the mailing of the newsletters to subscribers.

Subscribing for the Trusted Shops warranty

   To register you for the Trusted Shops warranty, we will need your email
   address, total purchase price, the selected payment method, purchase
   order number, your customer number (if you have one) and the name of
   the online shop from which you ordered the product.

   Your data will be used to enable us to ensure that your purchase order
   comes with a warranty and to enable you to use the Trusted Shops
   system. With the Trusted Shops system you may view your active and
   expired warranties, request a refund and rate your purchase orders. In
   this process, your e-mail address is the username you use to sign in to
   the Trusted Shops system and will be permanently stored for this
   purpose.

   Only if you want to make use of the warranty will we need additional
   information and personal data to check and process your request for a
   refund. In the process of registering your claim for a refund, we will
   collect your name, street address, telephone number, where appropriate,
   and your bank account number to make the refund. We will use these data
   solely for the purpose of handling your refund claim. After that, the
   data will be blocked from further use and finally deleted once all
   retention periods under commercial and tax law expire.

Subscribing to rating reminder

   If, during or after placing your order, you grant an express consent to
   receiving email reminders by ticking an appropriate checkbox or
   clicking an appropriate button (e.g. “Rate later”), your email address
   will be transferred to Trusted Shops so that we can send you email
   reminders about rating your purchase order using the Trusted Shops
   customer rating service. Other data that may be transferred includes
   shop URL, purchase order number and names and numbers of items you
   ordered, so that you can rate a transaction after finalisation,
   provided that the product rating feature is available for the ordered
   product. You may withdraw your consent to receiving email reminders at
   any time, with effect on your future orders.

   If you subscribe to the automated rating reminder service, you will be
   automatically receiving email reminders about rating a transaction
   after every purchase from the Trusted Shops members.  On your every
   visit, you will be recognised based on anonymised data.  You may
   withdraw your consent to receiving email reminders at any time, with
   effect on your future orders.

Leaving a rating

   If you leave a rating through the Trusted Shops rating system, without
   having previously made use of a Trusted Shops warranty, we will need
   your e-mail address to ensure that your rating is valid and reliable.
   The e-mail address will be used for the purpose of checking whether the
   person who leaves the rating is a customer of the online shop being
   rated and whether the rating can be verifiably attributed to a purchase
   order; to that end, the email address will be stored together with the
   purchase order number and the rating. If you rate a product, we will
   also store the names and numbers of the products ordered under your
   email address.

   In addition, we will use your email address to enable you to use the
   Trusted Shops system. In the Trusted Shops system, you may view (and
   change, if needed) your other ratings of shops and/or products, view
   your active and expired warranties (as long as warranty agreements were
   concluded under that email address), claim refunds, if any, and rate
   the concluded transactions. In this process, your e-mail address is the
   username you use to sign in to the Trusted Shops system and will be
   permanently stored for this purpose.

   In order to ensure security of the rating system, prevent false or
   incorrect ratings and enable smooth and proper operation of the rating
   system, we will also collect information about your IP address the
   moment you post your rating. It will be stored for up to 7 days in
   reference with the rating and then deleted.

Shopper Profile

   In addition, you may personalize your ratings by providing more
   detailed personal information when posting your rating or by entering
   more detailed personal information into the Trusted Shops system. Thus,
   we will be able to display your ratings with that additional
   information, whereas some of your information will be displayed only
   with some of its parts being masked to protect your privacy. The public
   will be able to view a summary of all your ratings left so far. Your
   email address will be never published, though. You may delete your
   personal data at any time; to that end, sign into the Trusted Shop
   system and clear the relevant fields. There, you may also make
   appropriate settings to hide your profile from the public view.

Membership registration

   Membership is offered exclusively to entities engaged in trading as
   part of their business activity or to self-employed persons. Your
   personal data will be collected if you voluntarily supply them to us
   when contacting us or during the registration for our services. We use
   your data solely to be able to offer you the information and services
   you request, which means that we will store and process only the data
   and information that are absolutely necessary to respond to your
   enquiry or execute an agreement.

   When you contact us or request membership, we will prompt you to enter
   certain data, such as your e-mail address, your name, street address
   and the address of your online shop. On the relevant pages, you will be
   able to see what information must be necessarily provided and what
   information is voluntary. We need the information to be able to respond
   to your enquiry or check your membership request. If you are a member,
   you may request us to block your data from further processing after the
   membership agreement expires; your data will be deleted upon expiry of
   all retention periods prescribed by tax and commercial law. If you
   contact us but did not sign a membership agreement, we will delete your
   data from our customer database if you request us to.

Transmission of data to third parties as part of the membership registration
process

   Only if you are an entity engaged in trading as part of your business
   activity or a self-employed person will we transfer your address
   details to credit bureaus during the process of concluding the
   membership agreement for the credit bureau to evaluate the liability
   risk and check your creditworthiness. Your creditworthiness and
   personal information will not be disclosed to any third parties unless
   you consent to a certain disclosure in a separate, express consent.

Apply for a job at Trusted Shops

   If you use this website to apply for a job at Trusted Shops, we will
   collect your personal information through our job application portal,
   operated by an external service provider. The data you furnish through
   our job application portal will be used solely for the purpose of
   recruitment for the job advertised and to check and process your
   application submitted in this context. Once the recruitment process for
   a given advertised job position is complete, the data will be blocked
   from further use and deleted upon expiry of any applicable retention
   periods.
