   Received: 24 Oct 2012 – Discussion started: 30 Nov 2012 – Revised: 23

   Abstract. A combined analysis of remote sensing observations, regional
   climate model (RCM) outputs and reanalysis data over the Greenland ice
   sheet provides evidence that multiple records were set during summer
   2012. Melt extent was the largest in the satellite era (extending up to
   ∼97% of the ice sheet) and melting lasted up to ∼2 months longer than
   the 1979–2011 mean. Model results indicate that near surface
   temperature was ∼3 standard deviations (σ) above the 1958–2011 mean,
   while surface mass balance (SMB) was ∼3σ below the mean and runoff was
   3.9σ above the mean over the same period. Albedo, exposure of bare ice
   and surface mass balance also set new records, as did the total mass
   balance with summer and annual mass changes of, respectively, −627 Gt
   and −574 Gt, 2σ below the 2003–2012 mean. We identify persistent
   anticyclonic conditions over Greenland associated with anomalies in the
   North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), changes in surface conditions (e.g.,
   albedo, surface temperature) and preconditioning of surface properties
   from recent extreme melting as major driving mechanisms for the 2012
   records. Less positive if not increasingly negative SMB will likely
   occur should these characteristics persist.
