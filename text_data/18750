What is a cookie ?

   Cookies have different functions. A cookie allows a site to recognize a
   specific user from one visit to another through a unique identifier.
   Some cookies can also be used to stock content found in an online
   shopping cart, save the language settings for a site, or direct
   interest-based advertisements.

What is the applicable legal framework ?

   By amending the article 5(3) of Directive 2002/58/CE through the
   adoption of Directive 2009/136/CE, European legislators established the
   principle by which storing information of user equipment or accessing
   information already stored can only be performed with the prior consent
   of the user, except if these actions are strictly necessary for the
   provider so that it can provide a service that was expressly requested
   by the subscriber or user. The article 32-II of the law from January 6,
   1978, includes this principle.

Presentation of the programme

   More than half the cases of customer dissatisfaction can be traced back
   to a break down in the Supply Chain, the functions of which play a
   highly strategic role within the company.

   The supply chain allows for a global vision of the overall movement of
   resources (physical, financial and information) within the extended
   enterprise. The real objective is to anticipate, plan for and meet
   customer needs whilst reducing costs and providing the opportunity for
   improvement in performance in an ever-changing environment.

   As such, it is by adopting a policy of innovation, and in particular
   digital innovation, that the supply chain is able to evolve. The
   digitalisation of activities is in part a response for the need to open
   up entities and implement transversal digital tools in a multi-channel
   approach.

   At the end of the course students will be able to:
     * Master fundamental logistics functions
     * Analyse, model and simulate the value chain
     * Steer innovation to consolidate the supply chain

5 good reasons to enrol on this programme:

   A multi-disciplinary programme that provides training for a career in
   supply chain consultancy or management positions in digital
   transformation projects in complex international environments.

Strengths / A ‘made by NEOMA BS’ experience

     * Off Campus Seminars: an in-company immersion is organised to
       illustrate each academic learning phase. The objective is two-fold:
       to share and highlight how things work in the real world and to
       identify areas of value creation throughout the Supply Chain. The
       goal is for students to develop an innovative approach.
     * Participants are confronted with authentic operational problems
       thanks to the intervention of professionals
     * Preparation for internationally recognised professional
       certifications. A real employability asset.
          + CDDL: Certified Demand Driven Leader: provides access to
            demand driven steering concepts and gives management teams and
            managers a comprehensive overview of the flow, as well as an
            understanding of the concepts required to sustain it.

     * Lean Six Sigma: recognised by the key market players in the
       development of operational competence in the implementation of
       Continuous Improvement projects.
     * Méthode AGILE: provides training for the implementation of the
       Méthode AGILE approach to digital transformation projects.

     Academic partnership with ASPER School of Business (Canada)
     * The programme involves classroom teaching and e-learning (for the
       fundamentals) through our partner CrossKnowledge platform. Such
       teaching methods allows participants to benefit fully from the
       classroom activities which focus on interaction.

What is the applicable legal framework ?

   By amending the article 5(3) of Directive 2002/58/CE through the
   adoption of Directive 2009/136/CE, European legislators established the
   principle by which storing information of user equipment or accessing
   information already stored can only be performed with the prior consent
   of the user, except if these actions are strictly necessary for the
   provider so that it can provide a service that was expressly requested
   by the subscriber or user. The article 32-II of the law from January 6,
   1978, includes this principle.

What is the applicable legal framework ?

   By amending the article 5(3) of Directive 2002/58/CE through the
   adoption of Directive 2009/136/CE, European legislators established the
   principle by which storing information of user equipment or accessing
   information already stored can only be performed with the prior consent
   of the user, except if these actions are strictly necessary for the
   provider so that it can provide a service that was expressly requested
   by the subscriber or user. The article 32-II of the law from January 6,
   1978, includes this principle.

   [victor-audebaud.jpg] Victor AUDEBAUD - Supply Chain Consultant

   “Most of the problems I deal with in the course of my work as a Supply
   Chain consultant concern innovation and optimisation as much as the
   digitalisation process within the information systems. The synergy
   between job expertise and technical competence is paramount to the
   success of tomorrow’s projects. And it is precisely this double
   competence proposed by the MSc DISC that is so highly appreciated by
   professionals within the sector.”

   [rafet-krasniqi.jpg] Rafet KRASNIQI, HIGHFI Managing Director

   “One out of two small, medium or intermediate sized company directors
   in France has yet to implement digital technology initiatives within
   the different layers of their enterprise. To remain competitive in an
   increasingly global market, it is essential to initiate a digital
   transformation of the Supply Chain, and for this it is necessary to
   find the workforce qualified to deal with these new challenges. HIGHFI
   assists companies, with the use of the agile method, to integrate the
   digital tools that will optimise the performance of their extended
   logistics chain. The MSc Digital & Innovative Supply Chain has found
   its rightful place among the range of high-level international
   diplomas. This will provide the foundations for the development of a
   new generation of supply chain project managers in such high demand on
   today’s job market.”

What is the applicable legal framework ?

   By amending the article 5(3) of Directive 2002/58/CE through the

   principle by which storing information of user equipment or accessing
   information already stored can only be performed with the prior consent
   of the user, except if these actions are strictly necessary for the
   provider so that it can provide a service that was expressly requested
   by the subscriber or user. The article 32-II of the law from January 6,
   1978, includes this principle.
