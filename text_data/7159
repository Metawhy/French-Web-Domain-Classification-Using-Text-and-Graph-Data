   Joint Ebola Update from NYC DOHMH and HHC

   Joint Ebola Update from NYC DOHMH and HHC

   Today, the City is announcing several updates on the Ebola situation in
   New York City.
     * The City is announcing that, after an additional physician review,
       one individual under quarantine because of contact with Dr. Spencer
       will now be subject to direct active monitoring. The individual
       poses no public health threat and is showing no symptoms.  This
       person's daily movements in New York City will no longer be
       restricted, and the individual will be assessed twice each day by
       Health Department staff.  One individual in New York City currently
       remains under quarantine.

     * The patient being treated for Ebola at HHC Bellevue Hospital
       Center continues to show improvement and is stable. He remains in
       isolation and is receiving treatment.

     * The City is also providing an update on the number of individuals
       under active monitoring in New York City. As of Wednesday, November
       5th, 357 individuals are being actively monitored by the Health
       Department. The vast majority of these individuals are travelers
       arriving in New York City within the past 21 days from the three
       Ebola-affected countries who are being monitored post-arrival, as
       well as Bellevue Hospital staff caring for Dr. Spencer.  The list
       also includes FDNY EMS staff who transported Dr. Spencer to
       Bellevue and the lab workers who conducted Dr. Spencer's blood
       test.  All of these individuals are being monitored out of an
       abundance of caution, and none are showing any symptoms.  The
       number of individuals who will be actively monitored will continue
       to fluctuate as people arrive or depart New York City, we learn
       more about people's exposures, and 21 days of monitoring has
       passed.

   the CDC website.
