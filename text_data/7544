8 of the best nightlife spots in Munich

   Photo: icanteachyouhowtodoit
   [munich.jpg]
   Dayana Aleksandrova
   Jan 17, 2017

   Munich is one of Germany’s trendiest cities. Regardless of whether
   you’re into hip-hop, hipster vibes or alternative, there’s a place on
   this list for you. All of these spots and more can be found on Matador
   Network’s new travelstoke app. Check it out and create some trip
   planning lists of your own.

1. BACKSTAGE

      BACKSTAGE Kultur- und VeranstaltungszentrumMünchen, GermanyThe best
     thing about this spot is it’s diversity – you’ll see heavy metal
     dudes, reggae fans, electronic music lovers and emos all in the same
     place. Unlike the majority of nightclubs in Munich which are very
     trendy and posh, this place is super unpretentious and a great
     alternative to the established nightlife scene. To me, it’s like the
     Munich version of our beloved Razzmatazz in Barcelona. Definitely
     worth visiting. #casual #dancing #club

2. Harry Klein

      Harry KleinMünchen, GermanyIt’s true that good things come in
     minimal packages – get it? This club’s a favorite spot for all
     lovers of minimal and it’s small size fits perfectly with the music
     style. #casual #dancing #mininal

3. Munich MMA

      Munich MMAMünchen, GermanyThis old-warehouse-turned-party-hub spot
     is great for when you’re in the mood for electronic music and fun,
     casual atmosphere. #casual #dancing #club

4. Milla

      MillaMünchen, GermanyMilla’s vibe is totally underground. You’ll
     hear rock, indie, jazz, hip hop and more. Can’t go wrong with that
     one. #club #dancing

5. Glockenbachviertel

      GlockenbachviertelMünchen, GermanyIf you somehow manage to
     pronounce this tongue twister of a word in the cab and make your way
     over, you’re in for a treat. This area of the city is lined up by
     bars on either side so you can pick on the fly according to your
     mood. #bar #nightlife #casual

6. Nv

      NvMünchen, GermanyDope hookah bar. The owners are Turkish (who
     prepare the hookah) and Greek. That’s how you know it’s good stuff.
     Great music and live DJ performances on the weekend. It’s a good
     idea to dress up and order one of their delicious mojitos while
     you’re at it. #dancing #club

7. Crux

      CruxMünchen, GermanyOne of the clubs locals flock to on the weekend
     mainly for hip hop music. Electro is also on the playlist. This
     place is fairly small and won’t get you overwhelmed so just kick
     back and enjoy. #dancing #club

8. Muffatwerk

      MuffatwerkMünchen, GermanyRight by the river, this club has a good
     balance of electronic music and live performances. I’d say dress up
     a little as the crowd is predominantly trendy. #dancing #club
