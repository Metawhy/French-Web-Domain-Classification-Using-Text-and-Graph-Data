Dear 2016, we're done .

   [31608150580_a830a2600e_z.jpg]
   We all have something to say about 2016 and I won't gush about
   everything I disliked about this year. Instead, I try to remind myself
   of all the good that took place despite the setbacks and
   disappointments.
   This year's favourites:
   Movies:
   • Taxi Tehran
   • Shield and Spear
   • Tim's Vermeer
   Places:
   • Cape Town, South Africa.
   • Steilneset, Norway.
   • Copenhagen, Denmark.
   Music:
   • Solange - A Seat at the Table
   • Anohni - Hopelessness
   • Christine & the Queens - Chaleur Humaine
   Books:
   • A Young Doctor's Notebook
   • The Almost Nearly Perfect People: The Truth About the Nordic Miracle
   • An Island in Time: The Biography of a Village
   Small victories:
   • This book. Two years in the making.
   • Our TED-Ed was published.
   • Writing.
   •••
   Album: My year 2016 through the lens of my iPhone.
   Previously... 2015 • 2014
   2017: Love conquers hate.
   On Blogging:
   I'm blogging less and less so I had to ask myself if there was any
   point keeping this blog at all. I've always thought of it as a visual
   diary, an exercise to make sure not a single month goes by without some
   form of recording. However, I had to do something to simplify the
   procedure. I removed all comments, I reorganised all labels, I deleted
   two-thirds of this blog's posts, I also deleted two old blogs of mine.
   Google doesn't make it easy for you to erase parts of your past online.
   It took hours, but I won.
