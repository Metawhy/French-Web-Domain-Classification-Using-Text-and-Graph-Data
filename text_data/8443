1. FUSIO PLATFORM: DATA PROCESSING
     __________________________________________________________________

1.1 Purpose of data processing

   The data is processed to allow our Customers to buy and release
   behavioral advertising and measure its performance through our
   Platform.

   On request of our clients, S4M can also perform cross-device
   attribution. It is the measurement and reporting of conversions of ads
   as they take place after multiple engagements across different devices.
   For example, a user may click on an ad on one device, but will finish
   the desired action on another device.

   Processing data also allow us to improve the technical functionality of
   our Platform, as well as our products and services.


1.2 Type of data processed

   General. In the context of its main business activity, S4M does not
   process data for its own purposes but on behalf of its Customers. To
   this end, S4M only processes data that are relevant for the performance
   of its Platform’s services, whether by nature or volume. By delivering
   an ad to you via the Platform, S4M collects data about End-user’s
   mobile device (such as smartphone, tablet etc) using specific
   technology, as explained below.

   The Internet. S4M services are provided thanks to the Internet. Hence,
   the use of S4M services includes the processing of data found in every
   communication sent over the Internet, such as: browser type (e.g.,
   Chrome or Internet Explorer); User-agent string (e.g operating system;
   operating system version); browser language (e.g., English or French);
   referrer addresses, Internet Protocol (IP) address.

   Platform customers’ data. When the Customer or Partner register to the
   Platform we ask for basic registration information, such as name,
   company, position, address, email address, phone, and other contact
   information. We may ask for voluntary personal information at other
   times, including but not limited to when Customer or Partner report a
   problem with the Platform.

   This type of information is deemed personal data and is used to contact
   Customer or Partner or determine its specific identity. When other
   information is linked to this information, it also becomes personal
   data.

   We may also automatically receive and record information in our server
   logs from Customer or Partner’s browser type (e.g., Chrome or Internet
   Explorer); User-agent string; browser language (e.g., English or
   French); device timestamp and time zone; Device screen size; Internet
   Protocol (IP) address, and other generally-accepted log information. We
   may also record page views (hit counts) and other general statistical
   and tracking information.

   Customer or Partner can access or correct certain personal information,
   such as applicable passwords, directly in the Account sections of the
   Platform. If Customer or Partner have provided personal data, such as
   his/her e-mail address when registering for our Platform, Customer or
   Partner may modify that information at any time by visiting your
   Account settings. Notably, since we may use its user name as the
   account identifier, Customer or Partner may not be able to change its
   user name. In addition, Customer or Partner can delete its account at
   any time.

   In a such case, S4M acts as Controller (having the meaning set forth
   under article 4 of GDPR) and its legal basis is the conclusion of the
   contract with its customer and/or partner

   End-users data processed through the platform, including geolocation
   data. When an End-User views an ad on a site or app which uses our
   services, we collect information about the ad that he/she has viewed
   (e.g. advertiser’s name, type of advert, etc) and the web site or the
   app where the ad was delivered. This information does not enable us to
   work out any End-users identity in real life but does enable us to
   recognize from which advertisements End-users are coming from thanks to
   the following main data collected: device timestamp and time zone,
   device type, network provider, Mobile advertising ID, IP address, the
   geolocation of used device such as Lat/long, user-agent string,
   operating system, operating system version, and screen size.

   Depending on domestic regulation, these data may be considered as
   personal data, for example, like under GDPR regulation.

   We may specifically collect the information about the ad End-users have
   viewed or clicked on. We collect some or all of the following
   information about the ad End-users have viewed, clicked on: (i) the
   content type of the ad (what the ad is about, e.g. games, finance,
   entertainment, news); (ii) the ad type (e.g. whether the ad is a text,
   image, rich media or video based ad); (iii) where the ad is being
   served (e.g. the address of the website on which the ad appears); and
   (iv) certain information about post-click activity in relation to the
   ad (e.g. whether you proceed to fill-in form, purchase the product or
   service advertised).

   We may also collect information of the specific places (mostly stores)
   that End-users have visited during the period of the advertising
   campaign to measure the performance of the ads.

   In some cases, we can collect your name, email address and other direct
   personal data when you fill out a questionnaire with such information.

   In a such case, Advertisers, for whom the ad campaign is released by
   S4M, act as Controller and S4M acts as Processor (having the meaning
   set forth under article 4 of GDPR).

   Cross Device Tracking. To measure and report conversions of ads as they
   take place after multiple engagements across different devices, our
   third-party service providers, including Tapad UK Limited, may set
   and/or access cookies or other data collection technology which collect
   information (not including your name, address, email address or
   telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites, mobile
   websites and/or mobile applications across your various devices, in
   order to provide content and advertisements about goods and services of
   interest to you across those various devices.
   Our partner is using a probabilistic model by matching anonymous
   signals to try and identify a user. These signals include:
     * Location (IP addresses)
     * Date
     * Conversion Type
     * Device IDs
     * Landing Page
     * Interests and web history

   If you would like more information about this practice and to know your
   choices with respect to it, please refer to the relevant third parties’
   privacy policies. Tapad’s privacy policy is available at
   https://www.tapad.com/privacy-policy.

   In a such case, Advertisers, for whom the ad campaign is released by
   S4M, act as Controller and S4M acts as Processor (having the meaning
   set forth under article 4 of GDPR).

   Cookies and finger–printing. We use a session first party cookie to
   track the user is coming to view a mobile website. The cookies contain
   a unique tracking ID per Ad placement and a session ID, and a user ID
   and will expire after 20 minutes. The user ID expires after 13 months.

   In certain instances, S4M may use HTML5 storage for enabling, tracking
   functionalities within an ad or for counting purposes. This can be
   removed by clearing your browser’s cache.

   In other instances, S4M technology solution may use all public
   information provided by users’ navigation:
     * User-Agent: String sent to web server which specifies client
       software navigation, smartphone’s OS version,
     * Device screen size,
     * Device timestamp and time zone,IP addresses,
     * Accept-Encoding: data which indicates if the request support
       encodings,
     * Accept-language: indicates what are the acceptable languages for
       response,
     * Accept-charset: indicates the character sets that are

   S4M reconciles those data to track the user along his ads-navigation:
   Ad display, Ad click, Click to store, Download of an application.

   In particular, S4M compares data collected from the advertising to data
   collected from the launch of an application (made easier by the use of
   our iOS/Android SDK) and reproduced navigation sessions per track code
   (used in all ads) to know exactly where the customer comes from.

   In a such case, Advertisers, for whom the ad campaign is released by
   S4M, act as Controller and S4M acts as Processor.

   Sensitive data. S4M do neither collect nor process any sensitive data
   such as personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political
   opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union
   membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the
   purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning
   health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual
   orientation, where the domestic regulation prohibits the processing of
   a such data, like under GDPR regulation.

   Children privacy. The Platform service is not directed to children
   (persons under the age of 13), and we do not knowingly collect, either
   online or offline, personal data from children. If we become aware that
   we have collected personal information about a child under the age of
   13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database.


1.3 How data is collected

   In order to serve our clients, S4M collects data from the Publishers
   via the SSP through the RTB protocol (Bidstream) in order to display
   the ads.

   This method (Bidstream) allows processing data that are directly
   related to the advertising campaign. For example, S4M does not collect
   geolocation data on a permanent basis. S4M processes data that are
   adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes of
   behavioural advertising which is why they are processed.

   S4M is not an audience provider, instead S4M relies on Bidstream
   information and, upon client’s request, external data provider who are
   either already working with our clients or one of our qualified
   Vendors.

   Finally, for ads performance measurement and tracking, upon client’s
   request, S4M can use:
     * its own Javascript library to collect in-ad activities and
       advertiser’s website conversions
     * 3rd party data from our qualified Vendors

   In addition, for the post-click tracking (examples for landing or
   application installation), S4M requests to the Advertiser to implement
   the S4M Tracking Library only after the user consent obtention.


1.4 How data is shared and processed

   S4M is member of IAB Consent and Transparency framework and bases the
   consent obtention and checking on the IAB consent signal provided in
   the Bid Requests from by publishers selling their inventory through
   SSPs. This new organization allows us to check our partners’ position
   and track consent chain as well.

   Data is shared with and processed by authorized person such as:
     * Platform Customers, who are Advertisers and their media agency,
       that use the platform to deliver advertisements for their own
       purpose (or on behalf of the advertiser);
     * S4M qualified partners, who are companies contributing to improve
       the service (e.g. audience measurement, viewability measurement,
       fraud detection);
     * S4M authorized employees, who are the people who operate the
       Platform or process information disclosed from S4M Corporate
       Website and Social Media

   These authorized persons are bound to S4M by a contract where the
   respect of data protection and confidentiality is a key engagement.

   Our partners are asked to provide detailed information on their Privacy
   and Security measures.  We perform reviews and regular audits of our
   partners’ privacy and security measures to determine if they comply
   with legal requirements and best practices. We require that each
   partner be legally authorized to collect, use and share your data
   before providing it to us.

   The list of our partners can be found here.

   More generally, any of our subsidiaries, or other companies under
   common control as us are required to honor this Policy. Additionally,
   in the event we go through a business transaction such as a merger,
   acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our
   assets, we expect that any and all information that we have will be
   among the assets transferred.


1.5 Retention

   Data retention is decided by the Customer when it acts as Controller.
   S4M undertakes not to keep any said data beyond the agreed term. In the
   case where this information is not provided by the Controller, S4M
   deletes by default the data processed through the Platform within 13
   months.


1.6 Data transfer

   S4M is an international group with its offices in Europe, United States
   and Asia. To this end, the Platform is supported by a technology that
   enables S4M to perform its services worldwide. Depending of the service
   used, the Platform is hosted in Ireland or in United States with relay
   server in Singapore. Hence, the information that we collect from You
   and about You may be transferred to and stored in a country other than
   Your country of residence, which may offer different level of
   protection of personal data as Your country of residence. However, S4M
   ensures to comply with relevant regulation and takes appropriate
   measures to keep your personal data protected. Especially, S4M ensures
   to comply with GDPR requirement regarding lawful transfer mechanism.

   The Platform is hosted by Amazon Web Services, that complies with the
   principles of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy
   Shield. This framework protects the fundamental rights of anyone in the
   EU whose personal data is transferred to the United States for
   commercial purposes. More information about EU-US Privacy Shield on the
   Official European Commission site.


1.7 Security

   S4M takes all reasonable measures to protect the security of Your
   personal data during transmission. We also take reasonable measures to
   safeguard personal data and to protect against unauthorized access,
   alteration, disclosure or destruction of such information through our
   data collection, storage and security practices. However, no
   transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely
   secure.

   You should take further precautions to protect personal data by
   safeguarding your user name and password and by limiting the use of
   shared computers.


1.8 Limitation of liability

   S4M makes its best efforts to protect user privacy. However, S4M does
   not control the privacy practices of the Ad Networks, Publishers,
   Advertisers and Social Networks. For details regarding their own
   privacy policies, we recommend visiting or contacting them directly.

   developers implement specific software development kits. Some SDKs are
   critical for developing a platform-specific app.

   Tag: HTML code. Typically JavaScript or an IFRAME, that tells the
   browser to request content from an ad server.

1. FUSIO PLATFORM: DATA PROCESSING
     __________________________________________________________________

1.1 Purpose of data processing

   The data is processed to allow our Customers to buy and release
   behavioral advertising and measure its performance through our
   Platform.

   On request of our clients, S4M can also perform cross-device
   attribution. It is the measurement and reporting of conversions of ads
   as they take place after multiple engagements across different devices.
   For example, a user may click on an ad on one device, but will finish
   the desired action on another device.

   Processing data also allow us to improve the technical functionality of
   our Platform, as well as our products and services.


1.2 Type of data processed

   General. In the context of its main business activity, S4M does not
   process data for its own purposes but on behalf of its Customers. To
   this end, S4M only processes data that are relevant for the performance
   of its Platform’s services, whether by nature or volume. By delivering
   an ad to you via the Platform, S4M collects data about End-user’s
   mobile device (such as smartphone, tablet etc) using specific
   technology, as explained below.

   The Internet. S4M services are provided thanks to the Internet. Hence,
   the use of S4M services includes the processing of data found in every
   communication sent over the Internet, such as: browser type (e.g.,
   Chrome or Internet Explorer); User-agent string (e.g operating system;
   operating system version); browser language (e.g., English or French);
   referrer addresses, Internet Protocol (IP) address.

   Platform customers’ data. When the Customer or Partner register to the
   Platform we ask for basic registration information, such as name,
   company, position, address, email address, phone, and other contact
   information. We may ask for voluntary personal information at other
   times, including but not limited to when Customer or Partner report a
   problem with the Platform.

   This type of information is deemed personal data and is used to contact
   Customer or Partner or determine its specific identity. When other
   information is linked to this information, it also becomes personal
   data.

   We may also automatically receive and record information in our server
   logs from Customer or Partner’s browser type (e.g., Chrome or Internet
   Explorer); User-agent string; browser language (e.g., English or
   French); device timestamp and time zone; Device screen size; Internet
   Protocol (IP) address, and other generally-accepted log information. We
   may also record page views (hit counts) and other general statistical
   and tracking information.

   Customer or Partner can access or correct certain personal information,
   such as applicable passwords, directly in the Account sections of the
   Platform. If Customer or Partner have provided personal data, such as
   his/her e-mail address when registering for our Platform, Customer or
   Partner may modify that information at any time by visiting your
   Account settings. Notably, since we may use its user name as the
   account identifier, Customer or Partner may not be able to change its
   user name. In addition, Customer or Partner can delete its account at
   any time.

   In a such case, S4M acts as Controller (having the meaning set forth
   under article 4 of GDPR) and its legal basis is the conclusion of the
   contract with its customer and/or partner

   End-users data processed through the platform, including geolocation
   data. When an End-User views an ad on a site or app which uses our
   services, we collect information about the ad that he/she has viewed
   (e.g. advertiser’s name, type of advert, etc) and the web site or the
   app where the ad was delivered. This information does not enable us to
   work out any End-users identity in real life but does enable us to
   recognize from which advertisements End-users are coming from thanks to
   the following main data collected: device timestamp and time zone,
   device type, network provider, Mobile advertising ID, IP address, the
   geolocation of used device such as Lat/long, user-agent string,
   operating system, operating system version, and screen size.

   Depending on domestic regulation, these data may be considered as
   personal data, for example, like under GDPR regulation.

   We may specifically collect the information about the ad End-users have
   viewed or clicked on. We collect some or all of the following
   information about the ad End-users have viewed, clicked on: (i) the
   content type of the ad (what the ad is about, e.g. games, finance,
   entertainment, news); (ii) the ad type (e.g. whether the ad is a text,
   image, rich media or video based ad); (iii) where the ad is being
   served (e.g. the address of the website on which the ad appears); and
   (iv) certain information about post-click activity in relation to the
   ad (e.g. whether you proceed to fill-in form, purchase the product or
   service advertised).

   We may also collect information of the specific places (mostly stores)
   that End-users have visited during the period of the advertising
   campaign to measure the performance of the ads.

   In some cases, we can collect your name, email address and other direct
   personal data when you fill out a questionnaire with such information.

   In a such case, Advertisers, for whom the ad campaign is released by
   S4M, act as Controller and S4M acts as Processor (having the meaning
   set forth under article 4 of GDPR).

   Cross Device Tracking. To measure and report conversions of ads as they
   take place after multiple engagements across different devices, our
   third-party service providers, including Tapad UK Limited, may set
   and/or access cookies or other data collection technology which collect
   information (not including your name, address, email address or
   telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites, mobile
   websites and/or mobile applications across your various devices, in
   order to provide content and advertisements about goods and services of
   interest to you across those various devices.
   Our partner is using a probabilistic model by matching anonymous
   signals to try and identify a user. These signals include:
     * Location (IP addresses)
     * Date
     * Conversion Type
     * Device IDs
     * Landing Page
     * Interests and web history

   If you would like more information about this practice and to know your
   choices with respect to it, please refer to the relevant third parties’
   privacy policies. Tapad’s privacy policy is available at
   https://www.tapad.com/privacy-policy.

   In a such case, Advertisers, for whom the ad campaign is released by
   S4M, act as Controller and S4M acts as Processor (having the meaning
   set forth under article 4 of GDPR).

   Cookies and finger–printing. We use a session first party cookie to
   track the user is coming to view a mobile website. The cookies contain
   a unique tracking ID per Ad placement and a session ID, and a user ID
   and will expire after 20 minutes. The user ID expires after 13 months.

   In certain instances, S4M may use HTML5 storage for enabling, tracking
   functionalities within an ad or for counting purposes. This can be
   removed by clearing your browser’s cache.

   In other instances, S4M technology solution may use all public
   information provided by users’ navigation:
     * User-Agent: String sent to web server which specifies client
       software navigation, smartphone’s OS version,
     * Device screen size,
     * Device timestamp and time zone,IP addresses,
     * Accept-Encoding: data which indicates if the request support
       encodings,
     * Accept-language: indicates what are the acceptable languages for
       response,
     * Accept-charset: indicates the character sets that are

   S4M reconciles those data to track the user along his ads-navigation:
   Ad display, Ad click, Click to store, Download of an application.

   In particular, S4M compares data collected from the advertising to data
   collected from the launch of an application (made easier by the use of
   our iOS/Android SDK) and reproduced navigation sessions per track code
   (used in all ads) to know exactly where the customer comes from.

   In a such case, Advertisers, for whom the ad campaign is released by
   S4M, act as Controller and S4M acts as Processor.

   Sensitive data. S4M do neither collect nor process any sensitive data
   such as personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political
   opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union
   membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the
   purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning
   health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual
   orientation, where the domestic regulation prohibits the processing of
   a such data, like under GDPR regulation.

   Children privacy. The Platform service is not directed to children
   (persons under the age of 13), and we do not knowingly collect, either
   online or offline, personal data from children. If we become aware that
   we have collected personal information about a child under the age of
   13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database.


1.3 How data is collected

   In order to serve our clients, S4M collects data from the Publishers
   via the SSP through the RTB protocol (Bidstream) in order to display
   the ads.

   This method (Bidstream) allows processing data that are directly
   related to the advertising campaign. For example, S4M does not collect
   geolocation data on a permanent basis. S4M processes data that are
   adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes of
   behavioural advertising which is why they are processed.

   S4M is not an audience provider, instead S4M relies on Bidstream
   information and, upon client’s request, external data provider who are
   either already working with our clients or one of our qualified
   Vendors.

   Finally, for ads performance measurement and tracking, upon client’s
   request, S4M can use:
     * its own Javascript library to collect in-ad activities and
       advertiser’s website conversions
     * 3rd party data from our qualified Vendors

   In addition, for the post-click tracking (examples for landing or
   application installation), S4M requests to the Advertiser to implement
   the S4M Tracking Library only after the user consent obtention.


1.4 How data is shared and processed

   S4M is member of IAB Consent and Transparency framework and bases the
   consent obtention and checking on the IAB consent signal provided in
   the Bid Requests from by publishers selling their inventory through
   SSPs. This new organization allows us to check our partners’ position
   and track consent chain as well.

   Data is shared with and processed by authorized person such as:
     * Platform Customers, who are Advertisers and their media agency,
       that use the platform to deliver advertisements for their own
       purpose (or on behalf of the advertiser);
     * S4M qualified partners, who are companies contributing to improve
       the service (e.g. audience measurement, viewability measurement,
       fraud detection);
     * S4M authorized employees, who are the people who operate the
       Platform or process information disclosed from S4M Corporate
       Website and Social Media

   These authorized persons are bound to S4M by a contract where the
   respect of data protection and confidentiality is a key engagement.

   Our partners are asked to provide detailed information on their Privacy
   and Security measures.  We perform reviews and regular audits of our
   partners’ privacy and security measures to determine if they comply
   with legal requirements and best practices. We require that each
   partner be legally authorized to collect, use and share your data
   before providing it to us.

   The list of our partners can be found here.

   More generally, any of our subsidiaries, or other companies under
   common control as us are required to honor this Policy. Additionally,
   in the event we go through a business transaction such as a merger,
   acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our
   assets, we expect that any and all information that we have will be
   among the assets transferred.


1.5 Retention

   Data retention is decided by the Customer when it acts as Controller.
   S4M undertakes not to keep any said data beyond the agreed term. In the
   case where this information is not provided by the Controller, S4M
   deletes by default the data processed through the Platform within 13
   months.


1.6 Data transfer

   S4M is an international group with its offices in Europe, United States
   and Asia. To this end, the Platform is supported by a technology that
   enables S4M to perform its services worldwide. Depending of the service
   used, the Platform is hosted in Ireland or in United States with relay
   server in Singapore. Hence, the information that we collect from You
   and about You may be transferred to and stored in a country other than
   Your country of residence, which may offer different level of
   protection of personal data as Your country of residence. However, S4M
   ensures to comply with relevant regulation and takes appropriate
   measures to keep your personal data protected. Especially, S4M ensures
   to comply with GDPR requirement regarding lawful transfer mechanism.

   The Platform is hosted by Amazon Web Services, that complies with the
   principles of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy
   Shield. This framework protects the fundamental rights of anyone in the
   EU whose personal data is transferred to the United States for
   commercial purposes. More information about EU-US Privacy Shield on the
   Official European Commission site.


1.7 Security

   S4M takes all reasonable measures to protect the security of Your
   personal data during transmission. We also take reasonable measures to
   safeguard personal data and to protect against unauthorized access,
   alteration, disclosure or destruction of such information through our
   data collection, storage and security practices. However, no
   transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely
   secure.

   You should take further precautions to protect personal data by
   safeguarding your user name and password and by limiting the use of
   shared computers.


1.8 Limitation of liability

   S4M makes its best efforts to protect user privacy. However, S4M does
   not control the privacy practices of the Ad Networks, Publishers,
   Advertisers and Social Networks. For details regarding their own
   privacy policies, we recommend visiting or contacting them directly.

   information is collected. We would ask you to share this information if
   not provided in your request.

   To learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt-out of some types
   of behavioral advertising for third-party ad networks, the user can
   visit the Digital Advertising Alliance:
   https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/. Additionally, the mobile
   operating system of a user (e.g. iOS or Android) should also give the
   user the option to manage his or her advertising preferences (this may
   be found in the “Settings” function on the respective device):
   https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074
   or https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662856


2.2 How to reset Mobile Advertising ID

   If you want to renew your profile used for behavioral advertising
   services, You can reset by yourself Your Mobile Advertising ID by
   following the processes described below:
     * IOs: go to “Settings” then “Privacy”, then “Advertising” and then
       “Reset Advertising ID” (see demo on Apple Support)
