About


   shadowness4 Hello! My name is Petya and I am a freelance graphic artist
   and illustrator.

   Coming from a family of artists and photographers, it was no surprise
   that I showed an interest in art from a very early age. I’ve been
   drawing since I could hold a crayon. One of my first drawings I can
   remember was on the living room wall ;). However, in my teenage years I
   didn’t take art seriously enough to formally study it and I went to
   study marketing instead. Since I graduated I’ve had several different
   jobs, none of them remotely linked to art. All that changed in late
   2006 when I discovered Photoshop. It opened a whole new world for me
   and I decided to pursue a career as a digital artist.

   My art is a mix between photography and painting, surreal and realism,
   the reality and my inner world.

   I am currently available for commissioned work for CD/DVD covers,
   book/e-book covers, booklets, artworks on request etc. If you want to
   hire me for your next project or are interested in licensing any of my
   personal works don’t hesitate to contact me
