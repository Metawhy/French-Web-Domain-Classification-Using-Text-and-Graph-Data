Welcome to Tagxedo, word cloud with styles

   Tagxedo turns words -- famous speeches, news articles, slogans and
   themes, even your love letters -- into a visually stunning word cloud,
   words individually sized appropriately to highlight the frequencies of
   occurrence within the body of text.

   Making word cloud is fun, and is much more fun with Tagxedo! With
   Tagxedo, you can:
     * make word clouds in real-time
     * customize font, theme, color, orientation, and shape
     * fine-tune with lots of options
     * save as images for printing and sharing
     * view your word clouds as thumbnails, and pick the one you want for
       further tweaking or saving
     * choose from many standard fonts
     * use custom fonts (e.g. downloaded from Font Squirrel, DaFont,
       FontSpace, or your own hand-drawn fonts)
     * constrain the word cloud to selected shapes (heart, star, animals,
       etc)
     * use images as custom shapes (e.g. a portrait, an animal silhouette)

   Feedbacks are more than welcome! You can also follow me at Twitter,
   Facebook, or my two blogs: All Things Tagxedo (for up-to-date news,
   tutorials, and fun ideas with Tagxedo), and Daily Tagxedo (current

   Please install Silverlight. If you have already installed Silverlight
   and Tagxedo still does not work, please try it on a different browser.
   In particular, Google Chrome no longer supports Silverlight. Firefox,
   Safari, and even Internet Explorer each has its own peculiarity with
   respect to Silverlight, some in the form of version-specific bug.
   Finally, Tagxedo only works on Desktop or Laptop computers...
