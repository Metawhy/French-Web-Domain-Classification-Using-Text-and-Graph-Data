Scientists engineer shortcut for photosynthetic glitch, boost crop growth by
40 percent

   Plants convert sunlight into energy through photosynthesis; however,
   most crops on the planet are plagued by a photosynthetic glitch, and to
   deal with it, evolved an energy-expensive process called
   photorespiration that drastically suppresses their yield potential.
   Today, researchers from the University of Illinois and U.S. Department
   of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service report in the journal
   Science that crops engineered with a photorespiratory shortcut are 40
   percent more productive in real-world agronomic conditions.

     “We could feed up to 200 million additional people with the calories
     lost to photorespiration in the Midwestern U.S. each year,” said
     principal investigator Donald Ort, the Robert Emerson Professor of
     Plant Science and Crop Sciences at Illinois’ Carl R. Woese Institute
     for Genomic Biology. “Reclaiming even a portion of these calories
     across the world would go a long way to meeting the 21st Century’s
     rapidly expanding food demands—driven by population growth and more
     affluent high-calorie diets.”

   This landmark study is part of Realizing Increased Photosynthetic
   Efficiency (RIPE), an international research project that is
   engineering crops to photosynthesize more efficiently to sustainably
   increase worldwide food productivity with support from the Bill &
   Melinda Gates Foundation, the Foundation for Food and Agriculture
   Research (FFAR), and the U.K. Government’s Department for International
   Development (DFID).

   Photosynthesis uses the enzyme Rubisco—the planet’s most abundant
   protein—and sunlight energy to turn carbon dioxide and water into
   sugars that fuel plant growth and yield. Over millennia, Rubisco has
   become a victim of its own success, creating an oxygen-rich atmosphere.
   Unable to reliably distinguish between the two molecules, Rubisco grabs
   oxygen instead of carbon dioxide about 20 percent of the time,
   resulting in a plant-toxic compound that must be recycled through the
   process of photorespiration.

     “Photorespiration is anti-photosynthesis,” said lead author Paul
     South, a research molecular biologist with the Agricultural Research
     Service, who works on the RIPE project at Illinois. “It costs the
     plant precious energy and resources that it could have invested in
     photosynthesis to produce more growth and yield.”

   Photorespiration normally takes a complicated route through three
   compartments in the plant cell. Scientists engineered alternate
   pathways to reroute the process, drastically shortening the trip and
   saving enough resources to boost plant growth by 40 percent. This is
   the first time that an engineered photorespiration fix has been tested
   in real-world agronomic conditions.

   “Much like the Panama Canal was a feat of engineering that increased
   the efficiency of trade, these photorespiratory shortcuts are a feat of
   plant engineering that prove a unique means to greatly increase the
   efficiency of photosynthesis,” said RIPE Director Stephen Long, the
   Ikenberry Endowed University Chair of Crop Sciences and Plant Biology
   at Illinois.

   plants to save fuel. Credit: RIPE Project

   The team engineered three alternate routes to replace the circuitous
   native pathway. To optimize the new routes, they designed genetic
   constructs using different sets of promoters and genes, essentially
   creating a suite of unique roadmaps. They stress tested these roadmaps
   in 1,700 plants to winnow down the top performers.

   Over two years of replicated field studies, they found that these
   engineered plants developed faster, grew taller, and produced about 40
   percent more biomass, most of which was found in 50-percent-larger
   stems.

   The team tested their hypotheses in tobacco: an ideal model plant for
   crop research because it is easier to modify and test than food crops,
   yet unlike alternative plant models, it develops a leaf canopy and can
   be tested in the field. Now, the team is translating these findings to
   boost the yield of soybean, cowpea, rice, potato, tomato, and eggplant.

     “Rubisco has even more trouble picking out carbon dioxide from
     oxygen as it gets hotter,  causing more photorespiration,” said
     co-author Amanda Cavanagh, an Illinois postdoctoral researcher
     working on the RIPE project. “Our goal is to build better plants
     that can take the heat today and in the future, to help equip
     farmers with the technology they need to feed the world.”

   While it will likely take more than a decade for this technology to be
   translated into food crops and achieve regulatory approval, RIPE and
   its sponsors are committed to ensuring that smallholder farmers,
   particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, will have
   royalty-free access to all of the project’s breakthroughs.
