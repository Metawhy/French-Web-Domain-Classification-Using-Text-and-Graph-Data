Alfonso Ocampo-Chavez Named to USL Championship Team of the Week

   Tacoma Defiance forward Alfonso Ocampo-Chavez today was named to the
   USL Championship Team of the Week for Week 21.

   Tacoma Defiance forward Alfonso Ocampo-Chavez today was named to the
   USL Championship Team of the Week for Week 21. He recorded a brace and
   added an assist in Tacoma’s 4-1 victory over Las Vegas Lights FC on
   Wednesday, July 24. The goals were the first in the USL Championship
   career of Ocampo-Chavez.

   Ocampo-Chavez came on as a substitute at halftime against Lights FC and
   scored his first goal of the evening less than two minutes later. He
   pounced on a loose ball after a misplay in Vegas’ back end and finished
   for his first career USL Championship marker. The 17-year-old First
   Team player completed his brace in the 66^th minute to give Tacoma a
   3-1 advantage. Nick Hinds sent a ball near the center of the area to
   the foot of Ocampo-Chavez, who needed just one touch with his left foot
   to push the contest out of reach.


   Tacoma Defiance next plays host to Orange County SC in Tacoma on
   Friday, August 9 (7:00 pm / ESPN+). The club then travels to play El
   Paso Locomotive FC on Saturday, August 17 (6:30 pm / ESPN+).
