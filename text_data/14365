   We know how it is. It's 5pm, and you've just had a glorious day of
   work, creating awesome wireframes for your next project. You are giddy
   with excitement, and cannot WAIT to see your designs in the hands of
   your sure-to-fall-in-love-with-it-immediately users.

   And then it hits you: crap, what should I make for dinner tonight?
     __________________________________________________________________

   The eternal question. The hardest part of cooking. Too many options,
   and none of them comes to mind.

   How anticlimactic, going from the heights of creative excitement to the
   panic of the looming dinner deadline, only a few hours away.

   That's where we come in.
   [dinner.png]

   From within Balsamiq Wireframes, go to the Help menu and select "What
   should I make for dinner?". You'll be taken back to this page.

   Lots and lots of EASY, EVERY-DAY recipes straight from the Balsamiq
   team's kitchens, in super-quick video format you can watch as you put
   your jacket on right as you leave the office.

   Just browse through the list of videos, pick one that looks good, jot
   down the ingredients and run out the door.

   Nothing fancy here, this is what we cook for ourselves when we don't
   know what to make.

   We hope you'll want to contribute with your every-day staple dinners.
   If you'd like to contribute with your video, just email us and we'll
   figure out a way to publish it. If you don't have a video but still
   want to contribute, send us your recipe via email and Val will try to
   make it!

   Buon appetito! :)

   Your friends at Balsamiq
