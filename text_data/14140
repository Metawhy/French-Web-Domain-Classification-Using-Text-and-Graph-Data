About EF SET

About EF SET

General Information

What is the EF Standard English Test?

   The EF Standard English Test (EF SET) is a free, online English test
   designed to meet the high technical standards as the other standardized
   tests in the field, such as the TOEFL or IELTS.

   With the EF Standard English Test, we set out to challenge the status
   quo – to build a testing solution that not only provides reliable
   measurement, but is also affordable, simple to use, and always
   accessible. It is the world’s first completely free standardized
   English test for learners of all levels, from beginner to advanced.

   With completion of our 50-min EF SET, you will receive a breakdown of
   your Reading and Listening skills, and also an official EF SET
   Certificate URL. You can add your personalized URL to your LinkedIn
   profile or include on your CV. Our score scale, based on the CEFR, is
   internationally recognized - making it easy for you to share your
   results and prove your English learning achievements.

   We also offer a 15-minute Quick Check which is a free and fast way for
   you to start with in getting an estimate of your English proficiency.

Who built this test?

   The EF SET was created by EF Education First with a team of language
   testing experts. Our advisory team has extensive experience in
   large-scale, standardized language assessment, drawing from previous
   work on TOEFL, IELTS, and TOEIC for other organizations such as
   Educational Testing Service (ETS) and The College Board.

   Chief among these have been Lyle Bachman (UCLA) , author of Language
   Assessment in Practice (Oxford 2010), the initial design consultant;
   Ric Luecht and John Willse of the University of North Carolina,
   Greensboro, the psychometric consultants and data scientists; and Mari
   Pearlman (Pearlman Education Group), the lead test development and
   operations consultant. Nathan Carr and Yoko Ameriks have served as
   language assessment experts.

You say that the EF SET is built to "certification standards," what does this
mean?

   We mean that there is empirical evidence of the reliability of the
   score as well as the quality of the test design and delivery process.

   Expensive, high-stakes tests that report a score that may have
   life-changing consequences for the test taker – such as TOEFL and IELTS
   for college admissions, immigration, or employment – must be able to
   support the scores with empirical evidence.

   While the EF SET reports scores only to the individual test taker, it
   has been designed and built to meet all of the quality standards of
   certification English tests, and there is public documentation to
   support this claim.

Why is it free?

   The EF SET is free because we want as many people to benefit from this
   test as possible. The design and development of EF SET borrowed from
   best practices in software engineering and manufacturing practices to
   significantly reduce development costs. The EF SET is also delivered
   online with automated scoring, making it possible for EF to offer this
   powerful tool for free to English learners with online access.

Does EF SET test all four skills?

   Currently, reading and listening skills are assessed by the EF SET
   tests.

Why did EF create EF SET?

   EF’s mission is to "Open the world through education." We believe that
   good education can break down barriers of language, culture and
   geography.

   As one of the world’s largest private education institutions with over
   50 years of experience, EF has been at the forefront of innovation in
   English language training. As online education and personalized
   learning content continues to become more sophisticated and
   increasingly more accessible, so is the need for students everywhere to
   accurately measure and assess their progress and achievements.

   Regardless of how you are learning English – online, with a friend, in
   school or all of the above – we believe that the EF SET will
   fundamentally improve your learning journey.

   With the launch of the EF SET, EF is also looking forward to more open
   discussions about the role of assessment in education, the future of
   personalized learning and the use of technology in classrooms.

What does "an adaptive test" mean?

   An “adaptive” test is a test in which the content of an individual’s
   test is responsive to whatever language proficiency the person
   demonstrates as the test unfolds. For example, if a person is able to
   answer every question correctly at the beginning of the test, then much
   harder questions are presented. If, on the other hand, a person
   struggles with the questions at the beginning of the test, much easier
   questions are presented next. At each stage of the test, the content is
   adjusted to measure each individual’s ability as precisely as possible.

   For more information about the Computer Adaptive Multi-Stage Testing
   engine, please download the resources available on Our Research page.

Is the EF SET reliable?

   The EF SET was built to the same standards of reliability as the other
   standardized English tests like the TOEFL, TOEIC or IELTS:
     * All test content was pretested on hundreds of thousands of
       international population of English language learners over many
       years, at all CEFR* levels. These test results were intensively
       analyzed for statistical reliability;
     * The standard error of measurement – a way of predicting how similar
       scores would be for test takers who took different forms of the
       test at different times – is comparably low;
     * And the standards for each CEFR level were determined by a formal
       standard setting study.

   For technical information about these features of the EF SET, please
   visit our Research to review our EF SET Academic Report. We will update
   the report as development continues and new features are added to the
   test.

   *The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: Learning,
   Teaching, Assessment, abbreviated as CEFR, is a guideline used to
   describe achievements of learners of foreign languages, developed and
   approved by the Council of Europe. The EF SET test results provide
   English test takers comprehensive information about their English
   proficiency in the context of this internationally recognized standard.

If the test is available to the public online, how is it secured from
cheating?

   Because it is intended as a learning tool, using the EF SET to its
   fullest advantage is the learner’s own responsibility. We do not reveal
   the correct answers to test takers, so that they can retake the English
   test after further study and reconsider their responses. As an adaptive
   English test that covers multiple CEFR levels from beginner to
   advanced, the EF SET is designed to be useful to an individual as a
   measure of growth in proficiency over time and as a proxy to other
   expensive, high-stakes English tests like TOEFL, TOEIC or IELTS. To
   take advantage of this design, we advise that the test taker follow the
   timing guidelines and not try to cheat the test.

Who should take this test?

   All English learners, regardless of how they are currently learning
   English, or their level should use the EF SET. Every learner can
   benefit from a trustworthy way to measure current proficiency level and
   mark progress over time.

What are EF's future plans for EF SET?

   EF is excited to continue the development on EF SET and improve our
   assessment tools. We encourage all English learners and teachers to use
   our English test and give us feedback or comments on their experience.

EF SET Tests

How is the EF SET different from other standardized tests of English like the
TOEFL or IELTS?

   You can feel confident that your EF SET and EF SET Plus scores reflect
   what you would receive on TOEFL and IELTS because the EF SET was built
   to the same standards of accuracy and reliability as other standardized
   English tests.

   However, EF SET is designed to fill a gap that none of the other
   high-stakes English tests currently fills – to give the individual
   users power over his or her own progress and to support English
   language learning for everyone, regardless of their economic status or
   location. EF SET removes these barriers by making our tests free and
   available online.

   Adding to these benefits, EF SET is currently the only standardized
   English test that accurately measures all skill levels, beginner to
   proficient, in alignment with the internationally recognized standard,
   the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). Other standardized
   English tests are able to assess some proficiency levels, but not the
   entire CEFR scale.

Why should I take the EF SET (50 min) if I have already taken the Quick Check
(15 min)?

   If you want a detailed profile of your English language proficiency,
   you should take the EF SET or EF SET Plus. In 15 minutes, the Quick
   Check is designed as a quick quiz to give a broad indicator of the
   general level of your English proficiency, not as a full, reliable
   measure. The EF SET is designed to give you a complete sense of your
   proficiency as it aligns to the full continuum of the CEFR levels from
   Beginner (A1) to Proficient (C2). Also, with completion of the
   50-minute EF SET or 120-minute EF SET Plus, you'll receive an official
   EF SET Certificate™ which you can easily share with your school or
   employer.

EF SET Score

What can I do with my EF SET score?

   Your EF SET Certificate™ can be posted to your LinkedIn profile in one
   click. Anyone who completes the EF SET (50 min) or EF SET Plus (120
   min) can use the "Add to Profile" button to upload their test score and
   official EF SET Certificate™. EF is working in collaboration with
   LinkedIn to make it easier for English learners to show proof of their
   skills to millions of recruiters around the world.

What does 0 or "No score" mean?

   If you receive a result of “0” or “No score” it is because you either
   did not answer any questions or you likely achieved very different
   scores on the reading and listening sections. Unfortunately, with
   scores that fall into two very different levels, we cannot provide a
   valid or meaningful combined EF SET score.

   If you are looking to improve your English, there are a number of ways
   that you can achieve this with EF Education First. Contact us to find
   our more information about EF’s opportunities to study abroad and our
   online courses for all ages and levels.

How do the scores differ on the Quick Check and the EF SET?

   The Quick Check (15 min), EF SET (50 min) and EF SET Plus (120 min) are
   reported on a 0-100 scale. However, the actual numerical
   representations of a score have different meanings. While the Quick
   Check will give you a general sense of your English proficiency, which
   is reported as a single numerical score (represented as a percentage
   for simplicity), the Quick Check score should be considered only an
   estimate of your English proficiency. It is also not necessarily
   predictive of your score on EF SET and EF SET Plus tests of your
   English proficiency.

   Your numerical scores on the Quick Check and the EF SET may place you
   in a different CEFR category because of the differences in the tests
   themselves. Please refer to the EF SET score comparison chart above for
   more detailed information about scores on these tests.

How can I improve my EF SET score?

   If you are looking to improve your English, there are a number of ways
   that you can achieve this. Contact us to find out more information
   tailored to your needs.

Is the EF SET score being accepted by schools, companies, and governments?

   The EF SET is designed primarily as a tool for individual students to
   support their learning. The scores are not reported to anyone else
   other than the test taker, unless the student chooses to provide the EF
   SET results as supplemental information to verify their English skills
   for university admissions or employment.

Our English Score

Our English Score

   When you take an English test, you get a score. Often you'll also get
   some indication of what that score means, expressed as an English level
   or label, for example "beginner" or "advanced". There are many
   different English leveling systems in use around the world, and an even
   wider variety of English tests, which have implicit or explicit
   leveling systems built into their scoring. Some English levelling
   schemes are built in to a particular English test, while others are
   theoretical frameworks without any associated test.

EF SET Scores

   The most reliable way to find out your English level is to take a
   well-designed assessment test. There are many tests to choose from, but
   taking the EF SET is a good place to start. You can use your EF SET
   score as an English level certification on your CV and on LinkedIn. The
   EF SET (50 min) is currently the only standardized English test that
   reliably measures all skill levels, beginner to proficient, in
   alignment with the internationally recognized standard, the Common
   European Framework of Reference (CEFR). Other standardized English
   tests are able to assess some proficiency levels, but not the entire
   CEFR scale. Using the EF SET to track your English level over months or
   years gives you a standardized way to evaluate your own progress.

   English level certification is required in applying for many university
   programs and visas. In the job market, although there are rarely
   official requirements, certifying your English level makes you stand
   out from the crowd. But in a broader sense, measuring your English
   level reliably, and being able to track your level change over time, is
   important for any English learner – how else will you know if your
   English is improving?

Converting from one English level to another

   Although it is notoriously hard to map one leveling system to another,
   the table below gives you a good approximation. If you’ve taken one of
   these tests, this table gives you an idea what type of score you might
   be able to get on another one.*

Why it's important to know your English level

   The English level system you use to describe your English skills is
   usually imposed on you from the outside. An employer, a school, a
   teacher, or an immigration authority asks you to take a particular
   English test, so you do, and then you describe your English level using
   that test's system. Depending on your goals and location, you are
   likely to be more familiar with one system of English levels than
   another. For example, if you're applying to university in the USA, you
   probably know what a TOEFL score of 100 means, whereas if you're trying
   to get a visa to move to the UK, you're more likely to be familiar with
   the CEFR level B1.

   some indication of what that score means, expressed as an English level
   or label, for example "beginner" or "advanced". There are many

     * What criticism has the CEFR faced?

What is the CEFR?

   The CEFR is a way of describing how well you speak and understand a
   foreign language. There are several frameworks with similar aims
   including the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages
   Proficiency Guidelines (ACTFL), the Canadian Language Benchmarks (CLB),
   and the Interagency Language Roundtable scale (ILR). The CEFR is not
   tied to any specific language test.

   The CEFR is a European scale and was specifically designed to apply to
   any European language, so it can be used to describe your English
   skills, your German skills, or your Estonian skills (if you have them).

The CEFR and EF SET

   The CEFR sets out six levels of foreign language mastery, and EF SET is
   aligned as such:

Where did the CEFR come from?

   The CEFR was put together by the Council of Europe in the 1990’s as
   part of a wider effort to promote collaboration between language
   teachers across all European countries. The Council of Europe also
   wanted to improve clarity for employers and educational institutions
   who needed to evaluate candidates’ language proficiency. The framework
   is intended to be used in both teaching and assessment.

   Rather than being tied to a particular test, the CEFR is a collection
   of can-do statements that list the functions you will be able to
   perform using a foreign language at any given level of proficiency. For
   example, one of the level B1 can-do statements is “Can produce simple
   connected text on topics that are familiar or of personal interest.” A
   teacher of any foreign language can use these can-do statements to
   evaluate you and design lessons to address the gaps in your knowledge.

Who uses the CEFR?

   The CEFR is used extensively in language teaching in Europe, both in
   the public education sector and in private language schools. In many
   countries, it has replaced previous leveling systems used in foreign
   language teaching. Most education ministries in Europe have an explicit
   CEFR-based goal for all students leaving secondary school, for example
   B2 in their first foreign language, B1 in their second. For job
   seekers, many European adults use a standardized test score, like the
   TOEIC, to describe their English level.

   Adoption of the CEFR is much narrower outside Europe, although some
   individual countries in Asia and Latin America have adopted it in their
   education systems.

Why is the CEFR important?

   In Europe, the CEFR is increasingly the standard way of describing your
   proficiency level in a foreign language, particularly in an academic
   setting. If you have studied more than one language, as most Europeans
   have, the CEFR is a conveniently standardized way to present two or
   more languages on your CV. In school or university, the CEFR is the
   standard framework across Europe and can be used without reservation.

   However, in a corporate setting, the CEFR is not as widely understood.
   If you decide to use the CEFR on your CV for professional reasons, it
   is still best practice to include a level descriptor, a standardized
   test score, and examples of instances in which you used your language
   skills (study abroad, work abroad, etc.).

How can I find out my CEFR level?

   The best way to find out your CEFR level is to take a well-designed
   standardized test. In English, the EF SET is the best choice because it
   is freely available online and the first test aligned to the CEFR. You
   will need to set aside 50 minutes to complete the test and find out
   your CEFR level. To find out your CEFR level in other European
   languages, the most common assessment tests are all aligned with the
   CEFR. Depending on the language, you will need to take a different
   test. Check with the official instructional body for the language in
   Europe, for example the Alliance Française for French, the Instituto
   Cervantes for Spanish, or the Goethe Institute for German. It is not
   common to use CEFR levels to describe your level in non-European
   languages.

What criticism has the CEFR faced?

   Many educators initially criticized the CEFR because of the breadth of
   its levels. Each of the six levels comprises a wide range of skills and
   abilities. A student who has just reached the B1 level is quite a long
   way behind a student who has almost, but not quite mastered all of the
   B2 skills, but both students would be defined as being in the B1 level.
   From a practical standpoint, teachers are required to break each of the
   six levels down into smaller sub-levels to design lessons and
   assessments.

   Outside Europe, many countries have a widely-adopted assessment test
   already in place. They have not seen the value in switching to a
   different leveling framework that is not aligned to their current
   assessment tests. For English in particular, the most widely-adopted
   standardized assessment tests are not aligned to the CEFR.
