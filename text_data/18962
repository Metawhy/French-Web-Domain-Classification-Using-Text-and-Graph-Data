Voice Interoperability Initiative

Committed to providing customers choice and flexibility to interact with
multiple voice services

   (BUTTON) ×

Our Mission

   In a world with multiple voice services each with different
   capabilities, we believe customers should have the freedom to choose
   their preferred service for any task. We aim to deliver this experience
   through multiple, simultaneous voice services on the same product, each
   with its own ‘wake word’ or invocation name—enabling customers to talk
   to the service of their choice in a secure manner by simply saying its
   name.

Customer Choice

   Building voice-enabled devices that promote customer choice and
   flexibility through multiple, simultaneous wake words
   [_blank]

Secure Interoperability

   Developing voice services that can work seamlessly with others while
   protecting the privacy and security of customers
   [_blank]

Technology Solutions

   Releasing technologies and solutions that make it easier to integrate
   multiple voice services on a single product
   [_blank]

Research and Development

   Accelerating machine learning and conversational AI research to improve
   the breadth, quality and interoperability of voice services

   "Multiple simultaneous wake words provide the best option for
   customers. Utterance by utterance, customers can choose which voice
   service will best support a particular interaction. It's exciting to
   see these companies come together in pursuit of that vision."

   -- Jeff Bezos, Founder and CEO, Amazon
