Dating in Australia: meet local singles with EliteSingles!

   The saying goes that there’s plenty of fish in the sea, but how do you
   find your coral trout amongst a school of regular gropers? It's about
   looking in the right place! EliteSingles members are tired of flings &
   short love affairs and share the goal of finding a long-term
   relationship with a like-minded partner. Most of our members are aged
   between 30-55 and are educated, ambitious and dynamic singles committed
   to the search for someone truly compatible. Register today to meet your
   special someone!

EliteSingles Australia

   For a country of such epic proportions, Australia is an incredibly
   under-populated country. Of course, what we lack in numbers we make up
   for in bustling multicultural cities, sparkling weather and
   well-spirited characters.  But it’s not all easy going here in the
   lucky country; the majority of us have failed to escape the hustle and
   bustle of everyday life, and it's no wonder that singles are
   increasingly looking online in search for a partner.

Compatibility is king

   Genuine compatibility is not just about pairing individuals with
   similar hobbies or interests. A fondness for horses, for example, is
   probably not enough to bring a couple through the ups and downs of
   life. Rather, at EliteSingles we believe that couples are compatible
   when one’s strengths compliment the other’s weaknesses, when shared
   values bring mutual understanding and when similar dating intentions
   create the foundation for a committed and lasting relationship.

   In order to introduce our members to local singles who are truly
   compatible we use a two-part Smart Profiling System to assess each and
   every new user. The first part of the assessment relies on
   a 240-question personality test, which is based on psychology’s
   construct of ‘The Big Five’ personality traits; extraversion,
   agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism. The second
   part of the assessment asks users to indicate their personal partner
   preferences on factors such as age, build, distance, smoking and
   drinking habits, religion and more. The thorough assessment process
   gives us valuable insight into the characteristics, values, and
   attributes of each of our members, which allows us to weed out the
   less-compatible matches and instead focus on providing quality
   introductions.

Taking online communication offline

   As compatible as a pair may look on paper, it’s that magical, often
   elusive ingredient –chemistry –that ultimately determines if an online
   match works as an offline couple. The first date is, of course, the
   vital step in the dating process. But it’s nothing to fear; a recent
   survey of EliteSingles members found that first dates are better with
   EliteSingles, revealing the efficacy of our matchmaking process.

Local singles

   You'd be surprised at just how many compatible singles are nearby. So
   if you are serious about your search for a partner, join the thousands
   of Australian singles who are actively looking for that special
   someone. It's time to meet local singles - register today with
   EliteSingles.

   EliteSingles › About us

About us

   ELITESINGLES is brought to you by Spark Networks Services GmbH, one of
   Europe’s leading online matchmaking providers. Founded in 2008 in
   Berlin, (former Affinitas) launched its first online dating portal
   eDarling in Germany in May 2009. Today, the company has earned the
   trust of more than 13 million singles, creating on average 2000 couples
   every month in over 20 countries worldwide.

   ELITESINGLES is a partnership service designed for Australian singles
   looking for a long-term commitment. Our smart profiling delivers
   compatible partner suggestions in line with your personal search
   preferences, and we manually verify all new profiles to ensure users
   have a safe environment in which to meet other like-minded singles.

   Our vision is to maintain the industry's highest standards – to be the
   dating site as committed as our members are to finding love.  Numerous
   certifications and awards testify how successful we already are in this
   area. Nevertheless, the most important indicator of the value of our
   work is, and will always remain, the couples that meet each other
   through our platforms on a daily basis.

Our Matching Process

   The ELITESINGLES matching process introduces members on the basis of an
   initial personality questionnaire and your individual search
   preferences. We curate the site by manually verifying all profiles,
   automatically removing inactive members, and proactively removing users
   we suspect are not serious. This means our members have a smooth
   browsing experience and can focus on dating.

   The ELITESINGLES personality profile is based on the “Big Five” model
   of personality psychology. Initially developed in the 1990s, it is one
   of the most important and renowned concepts in modern psychology. Using
   the results of five personality dimensions, we are able to identify
   couples who are particularly well suited to a long and happy
   relationship together. Then, if the couple's demographic data and
   personal preferences are also a match, the two members are suggested to
   each other.


   The demographic data we consider includes gender, age, residence,
   profession and level of education. Additionally, in order to match
   personal preferences we explore various aspects that could be
   significant for long-term relationship prospects. For instance, we ask
   "How important is your future partner's religion?" and "Do you want
   children? “

   Protecting your personal information is of our utmost priority. We
   utilise Manual Profile Verification, SSL Encryption and a Fraud
   Detection System to make sure members feel safe online. All sensitive
   data is encrypted and will not be revealed to any third party or other
   members.

   ELITESINGLES is also available in the United Kingdom, Ireland, New
   Zealand, Canada and South Africa.

     I'm not ashamed to admit I've tried a couple of different dating
     sites, but Elite is my favourite for a few different reasons. The
     women are smart and determined, and they know what they're looking
     for. And the matches are pretty good - I've had a few fun dates, and
     hey - we'll see where it leads! Stuart - Perth

     What I wanted was a dating website with genuine, mature men. Real
     people, who had their lives together. Elite Singles has been that
     and much more. It's a proper dating site - people are actually
     serious about meeting up and seeing where things go. I'm very happy
     with the site!Denise - Sydney
