The Trainers

   Our trainers, led by Oren Hollander, Approved Arm & Intel trainer, are
   an expert team where each one of them have a unique specialization.
   Areas of expertise are: Arm processors and IPs, FPGA design, Embedded
   Linux and RTOS, Computer vision, Cuda and OpenCL, Security for Embedded
   systems, and Artificial Intelligence.
   Our experts provides consultancy services as well including: power
   consumption optimization, efficient hardware-software partitioning,
   Homogeneous and Heterogeneous multi-cores, AMP and SMP implementations,
   Arm TrustZone, Arm NEON, hardware attacks and mitigation, and
   machine/deep learning on FPGAs, processors and GPUs.
   Our trainers tailor made the training to your needs!

Courses Material

   Our courses are a combination of the vendor official training material
   (Arm, Intel ,NXP, ST, Newae, etc.) plus our "special sauce" based on
   system point of view and many years of experience, customer questions,
   and customer issues.
   Thousands of questions asked during the years have been transformed
   into further material and practical labs (including interview
   questions). Thus, our courses achieve great success in the Hi-Tech
   market.
   We provide certification for our courses in addition to Arm official
   certification (in Arm courses).

Modularity

   Companies can choose from a wide range of topics and build a training
   program that suits their needs according to topics, number of training
   days, experience levels and practical labs level - from our various
   courses which built from modular topics. We recommend consulting
   with us about it.
   The practical labs can be done from our material or on YOUR SPECIFIC
   PROJECT!!

Industry Compatibility

   Courses provide in-depth coverage of all design considerations,
   problems and solutions, development tools specialization, coding style
   and complex project design. the training is therefore able to prepare
   engineers for immediate work and help integrate their acquired
   knowledge into individual projects.
   [icon_1.png]

Practical Labs

   All courses consist of practical work, "Hands-On” development tools
   and involve practical labs that embed digital problems for analysis and
   solution design. The labs are actually design problems from the
   industry, and the engineer will gain confidence in understanding and
   solving complex design problems at the end of the training.
   Another option is to do hands-on labs on your own project! thus,
   getting training & consultancy at the same time!
