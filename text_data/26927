We are statisticians for human rights

   Being independent, non-profit, and non-partisan, we can apply rigorous
   science to the analysis of human rights violations around the world. As
   scientists, we work to support our partners—the advocates and human
   rights defenders who “speak truth to power”—by producing unbiased,
   scientific results that bring clarity to human rights violence and by
   ensuring that the “truth” is the most accurate truth possible. Three
   directives guide our work:

Apply science to create new knowledge

   We help to establish a scientifically defensible historical record of
   human rights abuses, including publishing public reports and providing
   expert testimony in war crimes trials.

Conduct basic research and development

   We invent and extend scientific methods so that we can better
   understand patterns of mass violence.

Educate through outreach

   Through speaking engagements, publications, and training graduate
   students, we help those working in the human rights community to better
   understand the role and power of statistical data and reasoning.

The Syrian Calamity

   At the request of the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner
   for Human Rights (OHCHR), HRDAG undertook a comparison of seven
   datasets documenting killings in Syria. Based on this analysis, we
   found 59,648 unique, identifiable records of killings between March
   2011 and November 2012. Our work on Syria continues, paying special
   attention to what is happening in the Syrian prison system... Read

Killings by US Police

   Having worked in more than thirty countries facing oppressive violence,
   our experience tells us that official homicide reports are often
   inadequate. A recent Bureau of Justice Statistics report claimed that
   from 2003 to 2009 and 2011, there were approximately 7,427 US homicides
   committed by police. Through careful analysis of BJS data and methods,
   we arrive at a very different conclusion... Read more.

Justice in Chad

   Hissène Habré’s rule over Chad (1982–1990) was marked by allegations of
   systematic torture and crimes against humanity. Habré claims he was not
   aware of violations committed by the Documentation and Security
   Directorate, the state security force that pursued political opponents
   and operated prisons. We prove otherwise, in court... Read more.

Inaccurate statistics can damage the credibility of human rights
claims—that’s why statistics about human rights violations must be as
scientifically accurate as possible.

Who we are

   The Human Rights Data Analysis Group is composed of a diverse group of
   board members, full-time staff, and consultants. Employing a
   multidisciplinary approach, we work with experts in the fields of
   computer science, software development, mathematical and applied
   statistics, and demography.
