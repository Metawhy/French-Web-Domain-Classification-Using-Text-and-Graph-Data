   3DMark Time Spy is a popular and effective benchmarking tool for rating
   gaming performance. Frame rate figures show typical performance as
   tested by UL. The higher the frame rate and 3DMark score, the better
   the experience. Performance may change with system, driver, and game
   updates. Know more

   3DMark Time Spy is a popular and effective benchmarking tool for rating
   gaming performance. It is used by millions of gamers, hundreds of
   hardware sites and many leading manufacturers. The higher the score,
   the better the performance and user experience. Note that the frames
   per second numbers indicate the typical FPS.
   Level                   1
   Step Into the Game

   The system is capable of providing a good user experience in the vast
   majority of 1080p games with medium – standard settings.
   Level                   2
   Next Level of Gaming

   You can comfortably play all current 1080p games with high graphics
   settings. All products on level 2 and above are ready for VR.
   Level                   3
   Kick it into High Gear

   You can play all popular game titles with the same graphics setting as
   Level 2 and many games at max graphics setting at 1440p resolution.
   Level                   4
   Elite Gaming Experience

   Virtually all games run 60 FPS or more at 1440p resolution with highest
   graphics settings, and many games also run excellent in 4K resolution.

   Not every system and configuration will be tested explicitly. The
   scores and data presented are provided by UL and are an estimate of
   expected performance. UL tests all hardware in controlled conditions.
   Benchmark results may vary on some systems but have a precision with a
   margin of 3 percent. Changes in software, such as system updates,
   driver updates, or changes to the game may affect performance. In very
   special cases, the device is of a nature that does not deliver
   consistent performance.

   All PCs are tested with games running in 1080p resolution with medium
   quality settings. The more powerful PCs are also tested with games
   running in 1440p resolution with the highest graphical settings.

   3DMark Time Spy is a popular and effective benchmarking tool for rating
   gaming performance. It is used by millions of gamers, hundreds of
   hardware sites and many leading manufacturers. The higher the score,
   the better the performance and user experience. Note that the frames
   per second numbers indicate the typical FPS.
   Level                   1
   Step Into the Game

   The system is capable of providing a good user experience in the vast
   majority of 1080p games with medium – standard settings.
   Level                   2
   Next Level of Gaming

   You can comfortably play all current 1080p games with high graphics
   settings. All products on level 2 and above are ready for VR.
   Level                   3
   Kick it into High Gear

   You can play all popular game titles with the same graphics setting as
   Level 2 and many games at max graphics setting at 1440p resolution.
   Level                   4
   Elite Gaming Experience

   Virtually all games run 60 FPS or more at 1440p resolution with highest
   graphics settings, and many games also run excellent in 4K resolution.

   Not every system and configuration will be tested explicitly. The
   scores and data presented are provided by UL and are an estimate of
   expected performance. UL tests all hardware in controlled conditions.
   Benchmark results may vary on some systems but have a precision with a
   margin of 3 percent. Changes in software, such as system updates,
   driver updates, or changes to the game may affect performance. In very
   special cases, the device is of a nature that does not deliver
   consistent performance.

   All PCs are tested with games running in 1080p resolution with medium
   quality settings. The more powerful PCs are also tested with games
   running in 1440p resolution with the highest graphical settings.

   3DMark Time Spy is a popular and effective benchmarking tool for rating
   gaming performance. It is used by millions of gamers, hundreds of
   hardware sites and many leading manufacturers. The higher the score,
   the better the performance and user experience. Note that the frames
   per second numbers indicate the typical FPS.
   Level                   1
   Step Into the Game

   The system is capable of providing a good user experience in the vast
   majority of 1080p games with medium – standard settings.
   Level                   2
   Next Level of Gaming

   You can comfortably play all current 1080p games with high graphics
   settings. All products on level 2 and above are ready for VR.
   Level                   3
   Kick it into High Gear

   You can play all popular game titles with the same graphics setting as
   Level 2 and many games at max graphics setting at 1440p resolution.
   Level                   4
   Elite Gaming Experience

   Virtually all games run 60 FPS or more at 1440p resolution with highest
   graphics settings, and many games also run excellent in 4K resolution.

   Not every system and configuration will be tested explicitly. The
   scores and data presented are provided by UL and are an estimate of
   expected performance. UL tests all hardware in controlled conditions.
   Benchmark results may vary on some systems but have a precision with a
   margin of 3 percent. Changes in software, such as system updates,
   driver updates, or changes to the game may affect performance. In very
   special cases, the device is of a nature that does not deliver
   consistent performance.

   All PCs are tested with games running in 1080p resolution with medium
   quality settings. The more powerful PCs are also tested with games
   running in 1440p resolution with the highest graphical settings.

   3DMark Time Spy is a popular and effective benchmarking tool for rating
   gaming performance. It is used by millions of gamers, hundreds of
   hardware sites and many leading manufacturers. The higher the score,
   the better the performance and user experience. Note that the frames
   per second numbers indicate the typical FPS.
   Level                   1
   Step Into the Game

   The system is capable of providing a good user experience in the vast
   majority of 1080p games with medium – standard settings.
   Level                   2
   Next Level of Gaming

   You can comfortably play all current 1080p games with high graphics
   settings. All products on level 2 and above are ready for VR.
   Level                   3
   Kick it into High Gear

   You can play all popular game titles with the same graphics setting as
   Level 2 and many games at max graphics setting at 1440p resolution.
   Level                   4
   Elite Gaming Experience

   Virtually all games run 60 FPS or more at 1440p resolution with highest
   graphics settings, and many games also run excellent in 4K resolution.

   Not every system and configuration will be tested explicitly. The
   scores and data presented are provided by UL and are an estimate of
   expected performance. UL tests all hardware in controlled conditions.
   Benchmark results may vary on some systems but have a precision with a
   margin of 3 percent. Changes in software, such as system updates,
   driver updates, or changes to the game may affect performance. In very
   special cases, the device is of a nature that does not deliver
   consistent performance.

   All PCs are tested with games running in 1080p resolution with medium
   quality settings. The more powerful PCs are also tested with games
   running in 1440p resolution with the highest graphical settings.

   3DMark Time Spy is a popular and effective benchmarking tool for rating
   gaming performance. Frame rate figures show typical performance as
   tested by UL. The higher the frame rate and 3DMark score, the better
   the experience. Performance may change with system, driver, and game
   updates. Know more

Find out moreabout benchmarking from UL

   3DMark Time Spy is a popular and effective benchmarking tool for rating
   gaming performance. It is used by millions of gamers, hundreds of
   hardware sites and many leading manufacturers. The higher the score,
   the better the performance and user experience. Note that the frames
   per second numbers indicate the typical FPS.
   Level                   1
   Step Into the Game

   The system is capable of providing a good user experience in the vast
   majority of 1080p games with medium – standard settings.
   Level                   2
   Next Level of Gaming

   You can comfortably play all current 1080p games with high graphics
   settings. All products on level 2 and above are ready for VR.
   Level                   3
   Kick it into High Gear

   You can play all popular game titles with the same graphics setting as
   Level 2 and many games at max graphics setting at 1440p resolution.
   Level                   4
   Elite Gaming Experience

   Virtually all games run 60 FPS or more at 1440p resolution with highest
   graphics settings, and many games also run excellent in 4K resolution.

   Not every system and configuration will be tested explicitly. The
   scores and data presented are provided by UL and are an estimate of
   expected performance. UL tests all hardware in controlled conditions.
   Benchmark results may vary on some systems but have a precision with a
   margin of 3 percent. Changes in software, such as system updates,
   driver updates, or changes to the game may affect performance. In very
   special cases, the device is of a nature that does not deliver
   consistent performance.

   All PCs are tested with games running in 1080p resolution with medium
   quality settings. The more powerful PCs are also tested with games
   running in 1440p resolution with the highest graphical settings.

   3DMark Time Spy is a popular and effective benchmarking tool for rating
   gaming performance. It is used by millions of gamers, hundreds of
   hardware sites and many leading manufacturers. The higher the score,
   the better the performance and user experience. Note that the frames
   per second numbers indicate the typical FPS.
   Level                   1
   Step Into the Game

   The system is capable of providing a good user experience in the vast
   majority of 1080p games with medium – standard settings.
   Level                   2
   Next Level of Gaming

   You can comfortably play all current 1080p games with high graphics
   settings. All products on level 2 and above are ready for VR.
   Level                   3
   Kick it into High Gear

   You can play all popular game titles with the same graphics setting as
   Level 2 and many games at max graphics setting at 1440p resolution.
   Level                   4
   Elite Gaming Experience

   Virtually all games run 60 FPS or more at 1440p resolution with highest
   graphics settings, and many games also run excellent in 4K resolution.

   Not every system and configuration will be tested explicitly. The
   scores and data presented are provided by UL and are an estimate of
   expected performance. UL tests all hardware in controlled conditions.
   Benchmark results may vary on some systems but have a precision with a
   margin of 3 percent. Changes in software, such as system updates,
   driver updates, or changes to the game may affect performance. In very
   special cases, the device is of a nature that does not deliver
   consistent performance.

   All PCs are tested with games running in 1080p resolution with medium
   quality settings. The more powerful PCs are also tested with games
   running in 1440p resolution with the highest graphical settings.

   3DMark Time Spy is a popular and effective benchmarking tool for rating
   gaming performance. It is used by millions of gamers, hundreds of
   hardware sites and many leading manufacturers. The higher the score,
   the better the performance and user experience. Note that the frames
   per second numbers indicate the typical FPS.
   Level                   1
   Step Into the Game

   The system is capable of providing a good user experience in the vast
   majority of 1080p games with medium – standard settings.
   Level                   2
   Next Level of Gaming

   You can comfortably play all current 1080p games with high graphics
   settings. All products on level 2 and above are ready for VR.
   Level                   3
   Kick it into High Gear

   You can play all popular game titles with the same graphics setting as
   Level 2 and many games at max graphics setting at 1440p resolution.
   Level                   4
   Elite Gaming Experience

   Virtually all games run 60 FPS or more at 1440p resolution with highest
   graphics settings, and many games also run excellent in 4K resolution.

   Not every system and configuration will be tested explicitly. The
   scores and data presented are provided by UL and are an estimate of
   expected performance. UL tests all hardware in controlled conditions.
   Benchmark results may vary on some systems but have a precision with a
   margin of 3 percent. Changes in software, such as system updates,
   driver updates, or changes to the game may affect performance. In very
   special cases, the device is of a nature that does not deliver
   consistent performance.

   All PCs are tested with games running in 1080p resolution with medium
   quality settings. The more powerful PCs are also tested with games
   running in 1440p resolution with the highest graphical settings.

   3DMark Time Spy is a popular and effective benchmarking tool for rating
   gaming performance. It is used by millions of gamers, hundreds of
   hardware sites and many leading manufacturers. The higher the score,
   the better the performance and user experience. Note that the frames
   per second numbers indicate the typical FPS.
   Level                   1
   Step Into the Game

   The system is capable of providing a good user experience in the vast
   majority of 1080p games with medium – standard settings.
   Level                   2
   Next Level of Gaming

   You can comfortably play all current 1080p games with high graphics
   settings. All products on level 2 and above are ready for VR.
   Level                   3
   Kick it into High Gear

   You can play all popular game titles with the same graphics setting as
   Level 2 and many games at max graphics setting at 1440p resolution.
   Level                   4
   Elite Gaming Experience

   Virtually all games run 60 FPS or more at 1440p resolution with highest
   graphics settings, and many games also run excellent in 4K resolution.

   Not every system and configuration will be tested explicitly. The
   scores and data presented are provided by UL and are an estimate of
   expected performance. UL tests all hardware in controlled conditions.
   Benchmark results may vary on some systems but have a precision with a
   margin of 3 percent. Changes in software, such as system updates,
   driver updates, or changes to the game may affect performance. In very
   special cases, the device is of a nature that does not deliver
   consistent performance.

   All PCs are tested with games running in 1080p resolution with medium
   quality settings. The more powerful PCs are also tested with games
   running in 1440p resolution with the highest graphical settings.

   3DMark Time Spy is a popular and effective benchmarking tool for rating
   gaming performance. Frame rate figures show typical performance as
   tested by UL. The higher the frame rate and 3DMark score, the better
   the experience. Performance may change with system, driver, and game
   updates. Know more

   3DMark Time Spy is a popular and effective benchmarking tool for rating
   gaming performance. It is used by millions of gamers, hundreds of
   hardware sites and many leading manufacturers. The higher the score,
   the better the performance and user experience. Note that the frames
   per second numbers indicate the typical FPS.
   Level                   1
   Step Into the Game

   The system is capable of providing a good user experience in the vast
   majority of 1080p games with medium – standard settings.
   Level                   2
   Next Level of Gaming

   You can comfortably play all current 1080p games with high graphics
   settings. All products on level 2 and above are ready for VR.
   Level                   3
   Kick it into High Gear

   You can play all popular game titles with the same graphics setting as
   Level 2 and many games at max graphics setting at 1440p resolution.
   Level                   4
   Elite Gaming Experience

   Virtually all games run 60 FPS or more at 1440p resolution with highest
   graphics settings, and many games also run excellent in 4K resolution.

   Not every system and configuration will be tested explicitly. The
   scores and data presented are provided by UL and are an estimate of
   expected performance. UL tests all hardware in controlled conditions.
   Benchmark results may vary on some systems but have a precision with a
   margin of 3 percent. Changes in software, such as system updates,
   driver updates, or changes to the game may affect performance. In very
   special cases, the device is of a nature that does not deliver
   consistent performance.

   All PCs are tested with games running in 1080p resolution with medium
   quality settings. The more powerful PCs are also tested with games
   running in 1440p resolution with the highest graphical settings.
