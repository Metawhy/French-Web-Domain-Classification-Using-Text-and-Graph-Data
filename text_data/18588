Hello, I'm Ashley!

   I live in windy Oklahoma with my husband Steve and our 5 energetic
   kids—-and I LOVE making stuff! And by “stuff” I mean anything that
   involves sewing, crafting, baking, hammering, painting…you know, ALL
   the stuff! Which, let’s be real, is sometimes annoying because there’s
   a part of my brain that thinks I have 5,376 hours in my day! Aaaaagggh!
   Don’t worry…..those are my own issues I’m working through. Ha!
   But the “stuff” that I do find time to make, I REALLY love sharing here
   with you guys! So I’m really glad you’re here!
