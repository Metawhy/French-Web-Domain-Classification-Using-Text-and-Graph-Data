   About Us

Features

     * Bit-to-Bit High-Resolution Audio
       All Astell&Kern products includes the digital-analog converter
       (DAC) and are ready for high-resolution audio playback.
       Other products have traditionally used sample rate converter (SRC)
       method down sampling for playback. However, Astell&Kern products
       are capable of playing the original sound without any up or down
       sampling.
     * Distinctive Design
       The light and object are the main theme of Astell&Kern's design.
       Any shadow of an object portraits the exact shape from the
       perspective of the light at that moment. The way of reproducing the
       true sound of music from digital formats is similar.
       Nothing more or nothing less. The design motif of Astell&Kern
       reflects the philosophy of music and sound. Hence, the “light” and
       “shadow” are the inspiration of Astell&Kern.
     * Packed with Features
       Whether its USB DAC, balanced audio output, expandable memory, or
       USB audio out, Astell&Kern has it all in a portable package or in
       your home audio system.

The Audio Powerhouse


   KANN CUBE is the second model of the KANN line, which focuses on high
   fidelity with powerful output and low noise. The newly designed
   powerful amplifier and audio circuitry have been
   strategically implemented to offer a very low noise floor, even with
   its massive power output, making it an Audio Powerhouse capable of
   driving the most power-hungry headphones.
   Three Audio Output Modes, Up to 12V of Power Dual ESS ES9038PRO DACs,
   designed for Pro Audio Equipment 5-pin Mini XLR Output for Even Less
   Noise Quad-Core CPU 5.0" 720x1280 HD Touchscreen 32bit/384kHz, Native
   DSD256 Support Open APP Support for Music Streaming

   Introducing the Astell&Kern KANN CUBE, which achieves a more powerful
   output and lower noise than ever before.

Absolute Audio Powerhouse

   KANN CUBE offers 3 different power output options of High / Mid / Low,
   which can drive any headphone with unprecedented power never seen
   before in any portable device - 12Vrms for Balanced output and 6Vrms
   for Unbalanced output. To provide a natural and neutral audio
   experience with minimal distortion, a newly designed OP Amp and Volume
   IC manages power optimally and efficiently.

   A Comparison of outputs of KANN CUBE vs KANN vs AK380+AMP

ESS ES9038PRO SABRE Dual DACs

   KANN CUBE uses two 8-channel DACs, the ES9038PRO, one for the left and
   one for the right channel. As each DAC chip sends out 8 channels of
   audio signal through the Astell&Kern Analog AMP Block, you experience
   unlimited sound stage and the full depth of the original performance.



   About ESS SABRE PRO DAC

   The ESS SABRE PRO series of Digital-to-Analog Converters (DAC) is
   targeted for premium audiophile and professional recording studio
   equipment. The SABRE PRO series sets a new benchmark in high-end audio
   by offering the industry's highest dynamic range (DNR) with
   impressively low levels of total harmonic distortion plus noise (THD+N)
   in a 32-bit, 8-channel DAC. All PRO SABRE DACs feature ESS's patented
   32-bit HyperStream DAC technology which delivers outstanding sound
   quality and industry leading performance.

   ESS DAC Line-Up

   ESS has two major lines of DAC chips – the ‘SABER PRO’ for audiophile
   systems and ‘SABER HIFI’ for mobile devices, such as the LG V10, V20,
   V30 smartphones or Onkyo DAPs. The SABER PRO DACs are seldomly used for
   DAPs and are primarily used with Pro-Audio systems or traditional Hi-Fi
   products. The ES9038PRO is the latest DAC from ESS and the SABER PRO
   line. KANN CUBE is the first DAP device to adopt the SABER PRO DACs in
   a dual DAC configuration, dedicating 8-channels for the left and
   8-channels for the right side.

5-pin Mini XLR Output for Even Less Noise

   KANN CUBE offers a 5-pin mini XLR connector for the first time in an
   Astell&Kern player. Thanks to the even lower noise floor and higher
   audio output through the XLR connection, you can enjoy pure, clear
   audio playback. It offers easier connection to your home audio systems
   and active speakers with balanced connections.

  Enhanced Audio Processing Power with Quad-core CPU

   Some may think that only sound matters in Hi-Fi systems. While it does
   matter greatly, there are other factors that influence your immersive
   music experience as well. KANN CUBE is designed to remove any
   distracting elements, including noise, distortion and unintuitive user
   interface.

   The Quad-core CPU gives you even more processing power for your digital
   music and a lot faster, natural UI experience. Get lost in your music
   without distractions.

  Ultimate Sound Quality

   The latest ESS ES9038PRO dual-DAC design and the upgraded CPU in
   the KANN CUBE allows for accurate playback of native 32bit/384kHz audio
   with no compromise on sound quality. The music is played back,
   bit-for-bit, just as the artist and engineer intended for it to be
   heard.

   KANN CUBE also supports native bit-to-bit DSD playback up to 11.2MHz
   for the best sound possible.

  MQA Technology

   MQA (Master Quality Authenticated) is an award-winning British
   technology that delivers the sound of the original master recording.
   The master MQA file is fully authenticated and is small enough to
   stream or download. Visit mqa.co.uk for more information.
   Astell&Kern KANN CUBE includes MQA technology, which enables you to
   play back MQA audio files and streams, delivering the sound of the
   original master recording.

   The isolated sides of the rectangles on KANN CUBE are not simply for
   looks. They emphasize the role of the device by placing the player’s
   functions in the correct place for a more intuitive interface and
   better usability, while also providing a sense of aesthetic stability.
   The pursuit of connectivity and consistency of form and function is at
   the core of Astell&Kern's design philosophy.

   Combining Astell&Kern’s player performance with the high-powered AMP,
   KANN CUBE can produce the most powerful performance in the Astell&Kern
   player lineup and is designed to deliver a heavy and solid impression.
