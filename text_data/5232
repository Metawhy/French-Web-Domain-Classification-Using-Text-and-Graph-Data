„A platform needs to have it all and that’s what we’re now doing“ – Joëlle
Frijters, Improve Digital

   onlinemarketing.de, 28.09.2015

   Der führende Anbieter für Monetarisierungs- technologien präsentierte
   sich auf der dmexco den Besuchern und stellte seine neue In Page Video
   Advertising-Lösung vor.


   Auf der „Digital Marketing Exposition and Conference“, der größten
   Digitalmesse Europas, kamen am 16. und 17. September über 43.000
   Besucher und knapp 900 Aussteller nach Köln, um sich über die neuesten
   Trends und Entwicklungen zu informieren. Auch Improve Digital, der
   führende Anbieter von Monetarisierungstechnologie für Publisher, war
   auf der Messe vertreten und präsentierte sich den Interessierten vor
   Ort. Wir haben die Gelegenheit genutzt und ein Videointerview mit
   Improve Digital geführt.


   Videointerview mit Joëlle Frijters, CEO und Co-Founder sowie Torben
   Heimann, Managing Director bei Improve Digital

   Improve Digital unterstützt die Marketingaktivitäten von tausenden
   Advertisern und stellt die Brücke zu 250 Top-Publishern und
   Medieneigentümern weltweit her, wobei der Hauptfokus auf
   Premiuminventar liegt. Im Videointerview erklärt Torben Heimann,
   Managing Director, wie Unternehmen und Publisher die Lösungen von
   Improve Digital zur Monetarisierung nutzen können und erläutert die
   Bedeutung der dmexco für das Unternehmen. Auch CEO und CO-Founder
   Joëlle Frijters konnten wir für das Interview gewinnen, bei dessen
   Verlauf sie erklärt, dass die Wurzeln von Improve Digital in Desktop
   und Mobile liegen und seit zwei Jahren auch Video Advertising im
   Portfolio verankert ist. Vor dem Hintergrund der wachsenden Bedeutung
   von Programmatic Advertising und Big Data, geht sie darauf ein, dass
   Plattformen heutzutage eine umfassende Technologie benötigen und
   erörtert dabei die Vorteile der Lösungen von Improve Digital.

   can contact our Data Protection Officer at dpo@improvedigital.com or
   via the switchboard at +31 202 620 277. In this Platform Privacy Policy
   we describe how we use cookies and process data, including personal
   data, when you visit a site of one our publisher clients.

   We are committed to a lawful, fair and transparent processing of
   personal data, adhering to the EU General Data Protection Regulation
   (GDPR).

   1.

   How does Improve Digital use cookies


   Cookies to be able to sell and show ads

   The websites of most of our clients are accessible free of charge. They
   use advertising income to cover for their cost, so ads are for them a
   necessary and vital source of income.

   Our clients use the technology of Improve Digital to sell their
   advertising inventory. Through our platform they are able to sell it to
   numerous buyers. Our platform makes use of functional and
   non-functional cookies. For making use of non-functional cookies, we
   need your approval. When you visit a website from a company that makes
   use of our platform the website will ask your permission (opt-in) to do
   this.

   Our platform works as an auction that connects the buyers with our
   clients. In order to start the auction, Improve Digital sends a
   so-called bid-request to numerous buyers. In response, the buyer will
   send a so-called bid-response. The bid request that Improve Digital
   sends to buyers makes use of cookies and may contain personal data.

   Below we describe what cookies Improve Digital uses to establish a bid
   request, and how long they are used.

   Data used by Improve Digital to sell and show ads

   Improve Digital collects and processes the following types of
   (personal) data:
     * General data about the browser used for instance, whether it is
       Chrome or Firefox, and what version.
     * Whether you visit the website with a desktop/laptop or
       tablet/smartphone.
     * The version and language of the operating system used.
     * Upon access, the approximate geographical location of the visitor
       based on the IP address, at the country or region level.
     * The IP address used (the address of the Internet connection).

   Purposes that we use the data for
   Improve Digital uses the data it collects for the purpose of enabling
   the automated auction (bidding process) of ad inventory of our clients
   and to record views and clicks on ads.

   Our legal basis for the processing
   We base our processing on consent of the data subject.

   Where do we obtain the data from
   We collect our data via the above cookies.

   How long and where do we store data
   We store data for up to 90 days. If we interact with a cookies stored
   on your device, this period starts again.

   Who we share data with
   We share the above data with a large number of buyers, such as
   advertizers, brands, media agencies, and other intermediaries, although
   not all buyers receive the same data. The list of buyers changes on a
   continuing basis, and for this reason we cannot include a comprehensive
   list here.

   Transfer of your personal data
   If you are an EU resident, you should also know that we intend to
   transfer your personal data from your home country to countries and
   organization that do not offer an adequate level of protection for your
   personal data. When we transfer this data, we will do so only when we
   have put in place appropriate safeguards (a copy of which you can get
   by writing to our DPO), or have obtained explicit consent from you for
   such transfer.


   3.

   Your rights to your data


   Access rights

   You have the right to request access to your personal data that we
   process. You also have the right to:
     * Rectify incorrect personal data or erase it in certain
       circumstances.
     * Restrict or object to the processing of your personal data.
     * Receive your data so that you can use it elsewhere (data
       portability).

   If you wish to exercise any of the above rights, please contact us at
   privacy@Improvedigital.com. We will provide you with instructions about
   what information we need so that we are able to find the data in

   like to point out that this does not affect the lawfulness of the
   processing before the date that you withdrew your consent. To revoke
   your consent, please click here.


   Advertising on devices (Internet of things)
   Some of our clients also use the technology of Improve Digital to sell
   advertising space on Internet-connected devices that are not a phone,
   computer or tablet. For example, a smart tv, game console or mediabox.
   The possibilities of these devices are limited, and not everything
   described in this Platform Privacy Policy takes place with the selling
   of advertising space on such devices.
   When selling such advertising space our clients can only track what ads
   you have already seen. They cannot use our technology to look at your
   use of the devices to try and assess your interests.
   Also, for most of such devices it is not possible to generally not
   allow cookies or opt-out, although you can often remove all cookies.
   Consult the user manual of your device, or the privacy or cookie policy
   of the provider of the device to know how to do this.

   Opt-out of all cookies
   If you want to opt-out of cookies more generally, you can change your
   browser settings so that you receive a warning before cookies are
   placed. You can also adapt the settings so that your browser refuses
   all cookies or refuses only cookies from third parties. You can also
   remove cookies that have already been placed. Note that you need to
   change separate settings for every browser and computer you use. Please
   also be aware that refusing cookies does not mean that you will no
   longer see any ads.

   Whitelist of Advertising Technology Providers
   Whilst we are working with our trade partners and affiliates to
   implement new industry standards and frameworks, such as the IAB
   transparency and Consent Framework. We have in the interim put in place
   static vendor lists with some of our partners. Data Subjects and End
   Users should note that at present when you provide consent to Improve
   Digital or consent to the use of our cookies, this consent is applied
   to our present static vendor list, if you wish to review this list
   please click here.

   Der führende Anbieter für Monetarisierungs- technologien präsentierte
   sich auf der dmexco den Besuchern und stellte seine neue In Page Video
   Advertising-Lösung vor.


   Auf der „Digital Marketing Exposition and Conference“, der größten
   Digitalmesse Europas, kamen am 16. und 17. September über 43.000
   Besucher und knapp 900 Aussteller nach Köln, um sich über die neuesten
   Trends und Entwicklungen zu informieren. Auch Improve Digital, der
   führende Anbieter von Monetarisierungstechnologie für Publisher, war
   auf der Messe vertreten und präsentierte sich den Interessierten vor
   Ort. Wir haben die Gelegenheit genutzt und ein Videointerview mit
   Improve Digital geführt.


   Videointerview mit Joëlle Frijters, CEO und Co-Founder sowie Torben
   Heimann, Managing Director bei Improve Digital

   Improve Digital unterstützt die Marketingaktivitäten von tausenden
   Advertisern und stellt die Brücke zu 250 Top-Publishern und
   Medieneigentümern weltweit her, wobei der Hauptfokus auf
   Premiuminventar liegt. Im Videointerview erklärt Torben Heimann,
   Managing Director, wie Unternehmen und Publisher die Lösungen von
   Improve Digital zur Monetarisierung nutzen können und erläutert die
   Bedeutung der dmexco für das Unternehmen. Auch CEO und CO-Founder
   Joëlle Frijters konnten wir für das Interview gewinnen, bei dessen
   Verlauf sie erklärt, dass die Wurzeln von Improve Digital in Desktop
   und Mobile liegen und seit zwei Jahren auch Video Advertising im
   Portfolio verankert ist. Vor dem Hintergrund der wachsenden Bedeutung
   von Programmatic Advertising und Big Data, geht sie darauf ein, dass
   Plattformen heutzutage eine umfassende Technologie benötigen und
   erörtert dabei die Vorteile der Lösungen von Improve Digital.

   Schiphol-Rijk. You can contact us at privacy@Improvedigital.com. You
   can contact our Data Protection Officer at dpo@improvedigital.com or
   via the switchboard at +31 202 620 277. In this Platform Privacy Policy
   we describe how we use cookies and process data, including personal
   data, when you visit a site of one our publisher clients.

   We are committed to a lawful, fair and transparent processing of
   personal data, adhering to the EU General Data Protection Regulation
   (GDPR).

   If you have any questions about our use of personal data when you visit
   our website, apply for a job, or get in touch with us via our website,
   please take a look at our Website Privacy Policy.


   1.

   How does Improve Digital use cookies


   Cookies to be able to sell and show ads

   The websites of most of our clients are accessible free of charge. They
   use advertising income to cover for their cost, so ads are for them a
   necessary and vital source of income.

   Our clients use the technology of Improve Digital to sell their
   advertising inventory. Through our platform they are able to sell it to
   numerous buyers. Our platform makes use of functional and
   non-functional cookies. For making use of non-functional cookies, we
   need your approval. When you visit a website from a company that makes
   use of our platform the website will ask your permission (opt-in) to do
   this.

   Our platform works as an auction that connects the buyers with our
   clients. In order to start the auction, Improve Digital sends a
   so-called bid-request to numerous buyers. In response, the buyer will
   send a so-called bid-response. The bid request that Improve Digital
   sends to buyers makes use of cookies and may contain personal data.

   Below we describe what cookies Improve Digital uses to establish a bid
   request, and how long they are used.

   How does Improve Digital use personal data


   Data used by Improve Digital to sell and show ads

   Improve Digital collects and processes the following types of
   (personal) data:
     * General data about the browser used for instance, whether it is
       Chrome or Firefox, and what version.
     * Whether you visit the website with a desktop/laptop or
       tablet/smartphone.
     * The version and language of the operating system used.
     * Upon access, the approximate geographical location of the visitor
       based on the IP address, at the country or region level.
     * The IP address used (the address of the Internet connection).

   Purposes that we use the data for
   Improve Digital uses the data it collects for the purpose of enabling
   the automated auction (bidding process) of ad inventory of our clients
   and to record views and clicks on ads.

   Our legal basis for the processing
   We base our processing on consent of the data subject.

   Where do we obtain the data from
   We collect our data via the above cookies.

   How long and where do we store data
   We store data for up to 90 days. If we interact with a cookies stored
   on your device, this period starts again.

   Who we share data with
   We share the above data with a large number of buyers, such as
   advertizers, brands, media agencies, and other intermediaries, although
   not all buyers receive the same data. The list of buyers changes on a
   continuing basis, and for this reason we cannot include a comprehensive
   list here.

   Transfer of your personal data
   If you are an EU resident, you should also know that we intend to
   transfer your personal data from your home country to countries and
   organization that do not offer an adequate level of protection for your
   personal data. When we transfer this data, we will do so only when we
   have put in place appropriate safeguards (a copy of which you can get
   by writing to our DPO), or have obtained explicit consent from you for
   such transfer.


   3.

   Your rights to your data


   Access rights

   You have the right to request access to your personal data that we
   process. You also have the right to:
     * Rectify incorrect personal data or erase it in certain
       circumstances.
     * Restrict or object to the processing of your personal data.
     * Receive your data so that you can use it elsewhere (data
       portability).

   If you wish to exercise any of the above rights, please contact us at
   privacy@Improvedigital.com. We will provide you with instructions about
   what information we need so that we are able to find the data in

   You also the right to withdraw your consent at any time but we would
   like to point out that this does not affect the lawfulness of the
   processing before the date that you withdrew your consent. To revoke
   your consent, please click here.


   Advertising on devices (Internet of things)
   Some of our clients also use the technology of Improve Digital to sell
   advertising space on Internet-connected devices that are not a phone,
   computer or tablet. For example, a smart tv, game console or mediabox.
   The possibilities of these devices are limited, and not everything
   described in this Platform Privacy Policy takes place with the selling
   of advertising space on such devices.
   When selling such advertising space our clients can only track what ads
   you have already seen. They cannot use our technology to look at your
   use of the devices to try and assess your interests.
   Also, for most of such devices it is not possible to generally not
   allow cookies or opt-out, although you can often remove all cookies.
   Consult the user manual of your device, or the privacy or cookie policy
   of the provider of the device to know how to do this.

   Opt-out of all cookies
   If you want to opt-out of cookies more generally, you can change your
   browser settings so that you receive a warning before cookies are
   placed. You can also adapt the settings so that your browser refuses
   all cookies or refuses only cookies from third parties. You can also
   remove cookies that have already been placed. Note that you need to
   change separate settings for every browser and computer you use. Please
   also be aware that refusing cookies does not mean that you will no
   longer see any ads.

   Whitelist of Advertising Technology Providers
   Whilst we are working with our trade partners and affiliates to
   implement new industry standards and frameworks, such as the IAB
   transparency and Consent Framework. We have in the interim put in place
   static vendor lists with some of our partners. Data Subjects and End
   Users should note that at present when you provide consent to Improve
   Digital or consent to the use of our cookies, this consent is applied
   to our present static vendor list, if you wish to review this list
   please click here.
