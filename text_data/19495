Cardboard boxes

   (159 products)
   Cardboard boxes for every business need
   You know your business through and through but knowing what cardboard
   box to package up your products in is just as important. Cardboard
   boxes come in a variety of sizes and strengths, so finding the right
   one to improve your storage, moving or business needs will save you
   both time and money later down the line. Investing in high quality
   packing boxes that are tailored to your business ensures a smoother
   process for not only you and your team, but also your valued customers.
   What boxes are best?
   Understanding which cardboard boxes or postal boxes are best is the
   first step in choosing the best box for the job. If cardboard boxes for
   packaging and storage is your primary need, single wall cardboard boxes
   are perfect for shipping and storing smaller items due to their
   lightweight and cost-effective nature. Our archive and removal boxes
   are also an ideal solution when you’re filing documents or moving to
   new premises. Plus, our boxes come flat and assembling them is a breeze
   and once you’re done, you can learn how to dispose of your cardboard
   boxes easily.
   Go the extra layer with a double or triple wall cardboard box
   For items that need that extra protection, double wall cardboard boxes
   offer an additional corrugated layer to ensure that your items are kept
   safe. With this extra layer, these strong boxes can withstand stacking
   and transportation while preventing damage to the product inside –
   meaning you can maximise all your storage or transit space. If your
   cardboard box is set for a long distance journey, where temperature
   changes and knocks are likely, then heavy duty triple wall boxes will
   offer best results. The triple layer corrugated board works over time
   to absorb anything that might threaten your heavy or fragile items,
   ensuring it makes its final destination in one piece. Discover how
   corrugated cardboard is made for that triple protection.
   Personalise your delivery with a custom size box
   At RAJA, we take pride in being a cardboard box supplier with a wide
   range to suit every packaging need your business might have. Life isn’t
   uniform and nor are our cardboard boxes. Whatever you’re sending, our
   experts are happy to create and supply you with a custom size cardboard
   box, making the entire process fast, easy and tailored to you. For
   everything else, our FAQs will help answer some questions.
   Cardboard with a conscience
   For over 50 years we have been passionate about making sure the boxes
   we provide you are tough enough for your transportation or storage
   needs, but gentle on the environment. That’s why our cardboard boxes
   are 100% recyclable and are made with at least 70% recycled materials.
   Our FAQ page will tell you more about our great environmental ethos.

Protective packaging

   (116 products)
   Bubble wrap, loose fill and foam packaging that’s guaranteed to protect
   your products
   From bubble wrap and void fill to foam rolls and edge protectors,
   Rajapack has a huge range of protective packaging products designed to
   help you reduce waste and save money. So whether you’re storing
   products in your warehouse or shipping them to customers, talk to our
   in-house packaging experts and find the most cost-effective solution
   for your business.
   Our shock absorbent packaging can help protect your products against
   knocks and bumps. You can cushion products with void and loose fill,
   wrap them in bubble and foam packaging, or reinforce problem areas with
   corner and edge protectors. Alternatively, you can protect products
   against damp and static with our specialist packaging solutions. As
   well as our own, high quality products, RAJA stocks protective
   packaging from some of the UK’s top brands, including Aircap, Instapak,
   Eco-Flo and Sealed Air.
