Overview

   The MPRI is a research-oriented master programme in computer science
   run jointly by the following institutions: University Paris Diderot
   (which is the coordinating institution), l'Ecole normale supérieure de
   la rue d'Ulm, Paris, henceforth ENS Ulm, and University Paris Saclay
   (which includes l'Ecole normale supérieure de Cachan (ENS Cachan),
   l'Ecole Polytechnique, and Telecom Paris Tech). Moreover the Master has
   special ties with the following universities and research institutions:
   University Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC), CNRS, INRIA, and CEA.

   Its purpose is to train future scientists through intensive exposure to
   contemporary research in computer science. It is open to students who
   have completed a French Licence or equivalent Bachelor's degree at a
   French or foreign college or university.

   Most MPRI graduates continue on with a doctorate (Ph.D.), although some
   students successfully enter professional life after obtaining their
   Master's degree from MPRI. The MPRI + doctorate combination naturally
   leads to careers in academia (teaching-research positions at
   universities, full-time research positions at research institutions) or
   in industrial research and development.

   From a formal point of view, the Master MPRI corresponds to:
     * the specialization Recherche en Informatique (MIR) of the Master
       Informatique of University Paris Diderot and ENS Ulm.

     * the specialization Algorithmique et Fondements de la Programmation
       (AFP) of the Master Informatique of University Paris Saclay.

   The application rules determine the Master where candidates should
   apply and enroll. The validation rules of the Master are independent of
   the institution where the student enrolls.

The MPRI curriculum

   The aim of the MPRI is to offer students both core training in the
   fundamentals of computer science and more specialised training
   constitutive of a true introduction to research. One or two research
   internships complete this classical training curriculum.

   In view of the great variety of cultural and educational backgrounds
   which the students taking the MPRI present, we let the students select
   their own customised two-year curriculum, i.e. not only the courses
   they wish to follow, but also the number and type of internships.

   The second year (M2 year) begins with a first semester dedicated to
   specialisation by way of level 2 advanced courses. The second semester
   is devoted to a research internship within a laboratory, either in
   France or abroad.

   In addition to the above-mentioned internships abroad, students may
   request, subject to approval by the MPRI's Studies Committee, to take
   all or part of the first or second year courses at a foreign partner
   university.

   The specialisations available include:
     * Algorithms
     * Automata and Formal Languages
     * Automated Deduction
     * Combinatorics and Computer algebra
     * Computability and Complexity
     * Cryptography, Coding, and Security
     * Logics and Semantics of Programs
     * System Programming, Analysis, and Verification
