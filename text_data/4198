          + Facebook has banned a network of fake accounts that were
            trying to influence politics in Moldova.
          + The social network says the campaign had links to the Moldovan
            government.
          + Itʼs the latest example of groups using Facebook to
            nefariously meddle in domestic affairs in countries around the
            world.
       Another day, another covert campaign on Facebook to influence
       politics using fake accounts.
       The Silicon Valley social network announced on Thursday that it had
       discovered a network of hundreds and accounts and pages in
       targeting people in Moldova, in an apparent attempt to influence
       political debate and social issues in the country ahead of upcoming
       elections — and Facebook says that employees of the Moldovan
       government were involved.
       In a blog post, Facebookʼs head of cybersecurity police Nathaniel
       Gleicher said the company has "removed 168 Facebook accounts, 28
       Pages and eight Instagram accounts for engaging in coordinated
       inauthentic behavior targeting people in Moldova. This activity
       originated in Moldova, and used a combination of fake accounts and
       some authentic accounts to mislead others about who they were and
       what they were doing."
       The takedowns are the latest example of how malicious actors have
       weaponized Facebook, time and time again, to sow division and push
       political narratives. Itʼs a tactic that first drew scrutiny after
       Russia spread inflammatory disinformation and propaganda on
       Facebook in the run-up to the 2016 US presidential election.
       And it indicates that Facebook, despite significant investments in
       "safety and security," has yet to eradicate these nefarious
       activities outright, and that some governments are now seemingly
       using them against their own citizens.
       In January 2019, Facebook announced it had detected a similar
       campaign being run from Iran, targeting people in numerous
       countries, from Afghanistan to France, Germany, India, Israel, the
       US, and South Africa. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has previously described
       the battle between Facebook and hostile actors as an "arms race,"
       with both sides fighting to stay ahead.
       Gleicher said that employees of the Moldovan government were behind
       at least some of the activity:
       "The Page admins and account owners typically posted about local
       news and political issues such as required Russian or English
       language education and reunification with Romania. They also shared
       manipulated photos, divisive narratives and satire and impersonated
       a local fact checking organization’s Page that called out other
       Pages for spreading fake news. Although the people behind this
       activity attempted to conceal their identities, our manual review
       found that some of this activity was linked to employees of the
       Moldovan government."

          + The advertising and media industries will continue to see
            seismic changes in 2019, according to a new report by market
            research firm Forrester.
          + AT&T will buy Roku and Google will acquire LiveRamp in 2019,
            Forrester predicts.
          + Additionally, blockchain will become increasingly mainstream,
            and hyper-targeting will give way to contextual creative, the
            report says.
       From a bevy of M&A deals and consolidation on one end, to
       Facebookʼs Cambridge-Analytica scandal and GDPR on another, there
       were a lot of shake-ups in the advertising and media industries in
       2018.
       2019 will continue that trend, according to a new report by market
       research firm Forrester, which predicts not only more M&A action,
       but also trends like blockchain becoming more mainstream.
       "We feel that there are specific events and trends that will take
       place in 2019 – specifically around further M&A, blockchain
       introducing itself into advertising, creative supporting
       personalization and Facebook having to rely more heavily on
       Instagram and WhatsApp for growth," Collin Colburn, B2C marketing
       analyst at Forrester, told Business Insider.
       But on a macro level, the biggest battleground for media in 2019
       will be control for digital advertising dollars, he said. Amazon,
       AT&T, Verizon, and Disney have all made moves to counter the
       Facebook-Google duopoly, and will vie for their position with their
       technology stacks, distribution, and content capabilities.
       "Google and Facebook will start to feel this competition in 2019,
       and we will be watching to see if cracks begin forming in the
       foundation of the empires they have both built," Colburn said.
       Here are the five events that will reshape media ad advertising in
       2o19, according to Forrester:

AT&T will buy Roku to become a TV platform
       By snapping up Time Warner, AppNexus, and DirectTV, AT&T pieced
       together the content, technology, and distribution pipes needed to
       challenge the duopoly as well as rival TV networks. But to truly
       become a viable threat, it needs to become a bigger part of
       consumersʼ daily lives.
       AT&T will do that by acquiring Roku, Forrester predicts, as the
       acquisition will not only give it tremendous scale but also help it
       complement its new targeted advertising division, Xandr.
       "Buying Roku is a natural next step for AT&T after their
       acquisitions of Time Warner and AppNexus in 2018," Colburn said.

Instagram and WhatsApp will save Facebook
       From the Cambridge Analytica fiasco, to a cyber attack that
       impacted nearly 50 million user accounts, Facebook battled a spate
       of brand crises in 2018, severely impacting its brand reputation.
       The platform isnʼt growing at the pace it once was either, with
       monthly active users (MAUs) being flat in the second quarter of
       2018 in North America and falling in Europe, coupled with
       decelerated ad revenue growth.
       But the company canʼt be dismissed yet, according to Forrester,
       with Instagram quickly emerging as its shining star with more than
       1 billion monthly active users and a user growth rate outpacing
       Facebookʼs.
       "In 2019, we predict that Instagram will continue to pick up the
       slack while Facebook hones in on Messenger and WhatsApp to
       accelerate user and ad revenue growth for the parent company," the
       authors of the report write. "Messaging apps for one-on-one
       consumer interactions and advertising are still uncertain territory
       for brands but are increasing in interest — and Facebook will
       deliver."

Blockchain will become mainstream in advertising
       From ads that get clicked on by bots, to hidden fees and an
       overall lack of transparency, the digital ad ecosystem has been
       under fire of late on a number of fronts.
       A number of big brands and marketers are attempting to fight that
       by betting on blockchain, the distributed ledger technology that
       underpins the cryptocurrency bitcoin.
       By the end of 2019, advertisers will be able to follow every dollar
       that leaves their coffers, Forrester predicts, and be able to see
       exactly how much they are paying, and for what, at every step of
       the way.
       Big brands like Kelloggʼs, Kimberly-Clark, Pfizer, and Unilever are
       already leading the way by participating in a blockchain pilot
       program powered by IBM and Media Ocean that aims to bring complete
       transparency to media-buying.
       "Blockchain will make an important entrance in 2018, by exposing
       the value and costs of all the steps in the media supply chain,"
       Colburn said. "But it will be a couple of years before blockchain
       is ready to make the impact that marketers are really looking for –
       impression-level reporting that will expose advertising fraud."

Hyper-targeting will give way to hyper-focus on creative
       The rollout of GDPR sent many advertisers scrambling, casting a
       shadow on a future where they could hyper-target media, especially
       those brands lacking in first-party customer data.
       But as the use of consumer data comes under increasing scrutiny,
       the focus, at least for advertisers, will turn back to powerful
       creative, according to Forrester.
       In 2019, advertisers will start turning to creative adtech vendors
       like RevJet and Thunder to create contextually relevant ads cued by
       both first-party data, as well as data around the weather, time of
       day, and live events.
       Creative adtech will also improve ad quality and cross-channel
       storytelling. More brands will refrain from stalking consumers
       around the internet with cheap-looking, product-focused display
       ads, according to Forrester.
       "Despite what marketers and advertisers think, the media industry
       isnʼt nearly as customer-obsessed as it could be," Colburn said. "I
       am most bullish on advertisers trading in their hyper-targeting
       obsession for a hyper-focus on creative in advertising – it will
       improve both the customer experience and overall results."

A bidding war will break out for LiveRamp, and Google will take the cake
       Several players – from Adobe and Salesforce to ad holding companies
       – have had their eyes on LiveRamp since Axciomʼs data marketing
       services were acquired by IPG.
       The competition is only going to heat up more, with a huge bidding
       war breaking out for LiveRamp, according to Forrester.
       Forrester thinks the ultimate winner at the end though will be
       Google, which will outbid everyone with its trove of cash, making
       LiveRampʼs data available for customers using its newly branded and
       consolidated adtech stack, Google Marketing Platform.
       "With these acquisitions, the big keep getting bigger," Colburn
       said.

       Tim Cook
       Apple CEO Tim Cook AP One day, not too soon — but still sooner than
       you think — the smartphone will all but vanish, the way beepers and
       fax machines did before it.
       Make no mistake: Weʼre still probably at least a decade away from
       any kind of meaningful shift away from the smartphone. (And if
       weʼre all cyborgs by 2027, Iʼll happily eat my words. Assuming
       weʼre still eating at all, I guess.)
       Yet, piece by piece, the groundwork for the eventual demise of the
       smartphone is being laid by Elon Musk, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon,
       and a countless number of startups that still have a part to play.
       And, let me tell you: If and when the smartphone does die, thatʼs
       when things are going to get really weird for everybody. Not just
       in terms of individual products but in terms of how we actually
       live our everyday lives and maybe our humanity itself.
       Hereʼs a brief look at the slow, ceaseless march toward the death
       of the smartphone — and what the post-smartphone world is shaping
       up to look like.

The short term
       People think of the iPhone and the smartphones it inspired as
       revolutionary devices — small enough to carry everywhere, hefty
       enough to handle an increasingly large number of daily tasks, and
       packed full of the right mix of cameras and GPS sensors to make
       apps like Snapchat and Uber uniquely possible.
       But consider the smartphone from another perspective. The desktop
       PC and the laptop are made up of some combination of a mouse,
       keyboard, and monitor. The smartphone just took that model, shrank
       it, and made the input virtual and touch-based.
       So take, for example, the Samsung Galaxy S8, unveiled this week.
       Itʼs gorgeous with an amazing bezel-less screen and some real power
       under the hood. Itʼs impressive, but itʼs more refinement than
       revolution.
       Samsung Galaxy S8
       Samsung Galaxy S8. Business Insider
       Tellingly, though, the Galaxy S8 ships with Bixby, a new virtual
       assistant that Samsung promises will one day let you control every
       single feature and app with just your voice. It will also ship with
       a new version of the Gear VR virtual reality headset, developed in
       conjunction with Facebookʼs Oculus.
       The next iPhone, too, is said to be shipping with upgrades to the
       Siri assistant, along with features aimed at bringing augmented
       reality into the mainstream.
       And as devices like the Amazon Echo, the Sony PlayStation VR, and
       the Apple Watch continue to enjoy limited but substantial success,
       expect to see a lot more tech companies large and small taking more
       gambles and making more experiments on the next big wave in
       computing interfaces.

The medium term
       In the medium term, all of these various experimental and
       first-stage technologies will start to congeal into something
       familiar but bizarre.
       Microsoft, Facebook, Google, and the Google-backed Magic Leap are
       all working to build standalone augmented-reality headsets, which
       project detailed 3D images straight into your eyes. Even Apple is
       rumored to be working on this.
       Microsoftʼs Alex Kipman recently told Business Insider that
       augmented reality could flat-out replace the smartphone, the TV,
       and anything else with a screen. Thereʼs not much use for a
       separate device sitting in your pocket or on your entertainment
       center if all your calls, chats, movies, and games are beamed into
       your eyes and overlaid on the world around you.
       apple airpods in ear
       At the same time, gadgetry like the Amazon Echo or Appleʼs own
       AirPods become more and more important in this world. As
       artificial-intelligence systems like Appleʼs Siri, Amazonʼs Alexa,
       Samsungʼs Bixby, and Microsoftʼs Cortana get smarter, there will be
       a rise not just in talking to computers but in having them talk
       back.
       In other words, computers will hijack your senses, more so than
       they already do, with your sight and your hearing intermediated by
       technology. Itʼs a little scary. Think of what Facebook glitches
       could mean in a world where it doesnʼt just control what you read
       on your phone but in what you see in the world around you.
       The promise, though, is a world where real life and technology
       blend more seamlessly. The major tech companies promise that this
       future means a world of fewer technological distractions and more
       balance, as the physical and digital world become the same thing.
       You decide how you feel about that.

The really crazy future
       Still, all those decade-plus investments in the future still rely
       on gadgetry that you have to wear, even if itʼs only a pair of
       glasses. Some of the craziest, most forward-looking, most
       unpredictable advancements go even further — provided youʼre
       willing to wait a few extra decades, that is.
       This week, we got our first look at Neuralink, a new company
       cofounded by Musk with a goal of building computers into our brains
       by way of "neural lace," a very early-stage technology that lays on
       your brain and bridges it to a computer. Itʼs the next step beyond
       even that blending of the digital and physical worlds, as human and
       machine become one.
       Assuming the science works — and lots of smart people believe that
       it will — this is the logical endpoint of the road that smartphones
       started us on. If smartphones gave us access to information and
       augmented reality puts that information in front of us when we need
       it, then putting neural lace in our brains just closes the gap.
       Ray Kurzweil
       Futurist Ray Kurzweil has been predicting our cyborg futures for a
       long time now. Tech Insider
       Musk has said this is because the rise of artificial intelligence —
       which underpins a lot of the other technologies, including voice
       assistants and virtual reality — means humans will have to augment
       themselves just to keep up with the machines. If youʼre really
       curious about this idea, futurist Ray Kurzweil is the leading voice
       on the topic.
       The idea of human/machine fusion is a terrifying one, with
       science-fiction writers, technologists, and philosophers alike
       having very good cause to ask what even makes us human in the first
       place. At the same time, the idea is so new that nobody really
       knows what this world would look like in practice.
       So if and when the smartphone dies, itʼll actually be the end of an
       era in more ways than one. Itʼll be the end of machines that we
       carry with us passively and the beginning of something that bridges
       our bodies straight into the ebb and flow of digital information.
       Itʼs going to get weird.
       And yet, lots of technologists already say that smartphones give us
       superpowers with access to knowledge, wisdom, and abilities beyond
       anything nature gave us. In some ways, augmenting the human mind
       would be the ultimate superpower. Then again, maybe Iʼm just an
       optimist.

       Donʼt be surprised when you eventually see a new rocketship tab in
       your Facebook app.
       The tab is essentially a second News Feed, except without any posts
       or baby pictures from your friends. Instead, Facebook is using the
       tab to only show recommended videos and articles based on what you
       already like and watch in your main News Feed.
       Facebook has been quietly testing the new tab in different parts of
       the world for the past several weeks, a company spokesperson told
       Business Insider.
       “We are testing a complementary feed of popular articles, videos,
       and photos, customized for each person based on content that might
       be interesting to them," the spokesperson said. "Weʼve heard from
       people that they want an easy way to explore new content they
       havenʼt connected with yet.”
       Facebook frequently tests changes to its apps that are never rolled
       out to all of its 1.8 billion users. But now that more people,
       including those in the US, are starting to see the rocketship tab,
       Facebook appears close to making the feature available to everyone.

     —Ryan Hoover (@rrhoover) April 2, 2017
       Creating a second News Feed could help Facebook overcome a looming
       threat to its ad business. The company has warned that itʼs nearing
       the limit of ads it can stuff into the News Feed, and this new tab
       could let it show more ads in videos and between stories.

          + Facebook has banned a network of fake accounts that were
            trying to influence politics in Moldova.
          + The social network says the campaign had links to the Moldovan
            government.
          + Itʼs the latest example of groups using Facebook to
            nefariously meddle in domestic affairs in countries around the
            world.
       Another day, another covert campaign on Facebook to influence
       politics using fake accounts.
       The Silicon Valley social network announced on Thursday that it had
       discovered a network of hundreds and accounts and pages in
       targeting people in Moldova, in an apparent attempt to influence
       political debate and social issues in the country ahead of upcoming
       elections — and Facebook says that employees of the Moldovan
       government were involved.
       In a blog post, Facebookʼs head of cybersecurity police Nathaniel
       Gleicher said the company has "removed 168 Facebook accounts, 28
       Pages and eight Instagram accounts for engaging in coordinated
       inauthentic behavior targeting people in Moldova. This activity
       originated in Moldova, and used a combination of fake accounts and
       some authentic accounts to mislead others about who they were and
       what they were doing."
       The takedowns are the latest example of how malicious actors have
       weaponized Facebook, time and time again, to sow division and push
       political narratives. Itʼs a tactic that first drew scrutiny after
       Russia spread inflammatory disinformation and propaganda on
       Facebook in the run-up to the 2016 US presidential election.
       And it indicates that Facebook, despite significant investments in
       "safety and security," has yet to eradicate these nefarious
       activities outright, and that some governments are now seemingly
       using them against their own citizens.
       In January 2019, Facebook announced it had detected a similar
       campaign being run from Iran, targeting people in numerous
       countries, from Afghanistan to France, Germany, India, Israel, the
       US, and South Africa. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has previously described
       the battle between Facebook and hostile actors as an "arms race,"
       with both sides fighting to stay ahead.
       Gleicher said that employees of the Moldovan government were behind
       at least some of the activity:
       "The Page admins and account owners typically posted about local
       news and political issues such as required Russian or English
       language education and reunification with Romania. They also shared
       manipulated photos, divisive narratives and satire and impersonated
       a local fact checking organization’s Page that called out other
       Pages for spreading fake news. Although the people behind this
       activity attempted to conceal their identities, our manual review
       found that some of this activity was linked to employees of the
       Moldovan government."

          + The advertising and media industries will continue to see
            seismic changes in 2019, according to a new report by market
            research firm Forrester.
          + AT&T will buy Roku and Google will acquire LiveRamp in 2019,
            Forrester predicts.
          + Additionally, blockchain will become increasingly mainstream,
            and hyper-targeting will give way to contextual creative, the
            report says.
       From a bevy of M&A deals and consolidation on one end, to
       Facebookʼs Cambridge-Analytica scandal and GDPR on another, there
       were a lot of shake-ups in the advertising and media industries in
       2018.
       2019 will continue that trend, according to a new report by market
       research firm Forrester, which predicts not only more M&A action,
       but also trends like blockchain becoming more mainstream.
       "We feel that there are specific events and trends that will take
       place in 2019 – specifically around further M&A, blockchain
       introducing itself into advertising, creative supporting
       personalization and Facebook having to rely more heavily on
       Instagram and WhatsApp for growth," Collin Colburn, B2C marketing
       analyst at Forrester, told Business Insider.
       But on a macro level, the biggest battleground for media in 2019
       will be control for digital advertising dollars, he said. Amazon,
       AT&T, Verizon, and Disney have all made moves to counter the
       Facebook-Google duopoly, and will vie for their position with their
       technology stacks, distribution, and content capabilities.
       "Google and Facebook will start to feel this competition in 2019,
       and we will be watching to see if cracks begin forming in the
       foundation of the empires they have both built," Colburn said.
       Here are the five events that will reshape media ad advertising in
       2o19, according to Forrester:

AT&T will buy Roku to become a TV platform
       By snapping up Time Warner, AppNexus, and DirectTV, AT&T pieced
       together the content, technology, and distribution pipes needed to
       challenge the duopoly as well as rival TV networks. But to truly
       become a viable threat, it needs to become a bigger part of
       consumersʼ daily lives.
       AT&T will do that by acquiring Roku, Forrester predicts, as the
       acquisition will not only give it tremendous scale but also help it
       complement its new targeted advertising division, Xandr.
       "Buying Roku is a natural next step for AT&T after their
       acquisitions of Time Warner and AppNexus in 2018," Colburn said.

Instagram and WhatsApp will save Facebook
       From the Cambridge Analytica fiasco, to a cyber attack that
       impacted nearly 50 million user accounts, Facebook battled a spate
       of brand crises in 2018, severely impacting its brand reputation.
       The platform isnʼt growing at the pace it once was either, with
       monthly active users (MAUs) being flat in the second quarter of
       2018 in North America and falling in Europe, coupled with
       decelerated ad revenue growth.
       But the company canʼt be dismissed yet, according to Forrester,
       with Instagram quickly emerging as its shining star with more than
       1 billion monthly active users and a user growth rate outpacing
       Facebookʼs.
       "In 2019, we predict that Instagram will continue to pick up the
       slack while Facebook hones in on Messenger and WhatsApp to
       accelerate user and ad revenue growth for the parent company," the
       authors of the report write. "Messaging apps for one-on-one
       consumer interactions and advertising are still uncertain territory
       for brands but are increasing in interest — and Facebook will
       deliver."

Blockchain will become mainstream in advertising
       From ads that get clicked on by bots, to hidden fees and an
       overall lack of transparency, the digital ad ecosystem has been
       under fire of late on a number of fronts.
       A number of big brands and marketers are attempting to fight that
       by betting on blockchain, the distributed ledger technology that
       underpins the cryptocurrency bitcoin.
       By the end of 2019, advertisers will be able to follow every dollar
       that leaves their coffers, Forrester predicts, and be able to see
       exactly how much they are paying, and for what, at every step of
       the way.
       Big brands like Kelloggʼs, Kimberly-Clark, Pfizer, and Unilever are
       already leading the way by participating in a blockchain pilot
       program powered by IBM and Media Ocean that aims to bring complete
       transparency to media-buying.
       "Blockchain will make an important entrance in 2018, by exposing
       the value and costs of all the steps in the media supply chain,"
       Colburn said. "But it will be a couple of years before blockchain
       is ready to make the impact that marketers are really looking for –
       impression-level reporting that will expose advertising fraud."

Hyper-targeting will give way to hyper-focus on creative
       The rollout of GDPR sent many advertisers scrambling, casting a
       shadow on a future where they could hyper-target media, especially
       those brands lacking in first-party customer data.
       But as the use of consumer data comes under increasing scrutiny,
       the focus, at least for advertisers, will turn back to powerful
       creative, according to Forrester.
       In 2019, advertisers will start turning to creative adtech vendors
       like RevJet and Thunder to create contextually relevant ads cued by
       both first-party data, as well as data around the weather, time of
       day, and live events.
       Creative adtech will also improve ad quality and cross-channel
       storytelling. More brands will refrain from stalking consumers
       around the internet with cheap-looking, product-focused display
       ads, according to Forrester.
       "Despite what marketers and advertisers think, the media industry
       isnʼt nearly as customer-obsessed as it could be," Colburn said. "I
       am most bullish on advertisers trading in their hyper-targeting
       obsession for a hyper-focus on creative in advertising – it will
       improve both the customer experience and overall results."

A bidding war will break out for LiveRamp, and Google will take the cake
       Several players – from Adobe and Salesforce to ad holding companies
       – have had their eyes on LiveRamp since Axciomʼs data marketing
       services were acquired by IPG.
       The competition is only going to heat up more, with a huge bidding
       war breaking out for LiveRamp, according to Forrester.
       Forrester thinks the ultimate winner at the end though will be
       Google, which will outbid everyone with its trove of cash, making
       LiveRampʼs data available for customers using its newly branded and
       consolidated adtech stack, Google Marketing Platform.
       "With these acquisitions, the big keep getting bigger," Colburn
       said.

       Tim Cook
       Apple CEO Tim Cook AP One day, not too soon — but still sooner than
       you think — the smartphone will all but vanish, the way beepers and
       fax machines did before it.
       Make no mistake: Weʼre still probably at least a decade away from
       any kind of meaningful shift away from the smartphone. (And if
       weʼre all cyborgs by 2027, Iʼll happily eat my words. Assuming
       weʼre still eating at all, I guess.)
       Yet, piece by piece, the groundwork for the eventual demise of the
       smartphone is being laid by Elon Musk, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon,
       and a countless number of startups that still have a part to play.
       And, let me tell you: If and when the smartphone does die, thatʼs
       when things are going to get really weird for everybody. Not just
       in terms of individual products but in terms of how we actually
       live our everyday lives and maybe our humanity itself.
       Hereʼs a brief look at the slow, ceaseless march toward the death
       of the smartphone — and what the post-smartphone world is shaping
       up to look like.

The short term
       People think of the iPhone and the smartphones it inspired as
       revolutionary devices — small enough to carry everywhere, hefty
       enough to handle an increasingly large number of daily tasks, and
       packed full of the right mix of cameras and GPS sensors to make
       apps like Snapchat and Uber uniquely possible.
       But consider the smartphone from another perspective. The desktop
       PC and the laptop are made up of some combination of a mouse,
       keyboard, and monitor. The smartphone just took that model, shrank
       it, and made the input virtual and touch-based.
       So take, for example, the Samsung Galaxy S8, unveiled this week.
       Itʼs gorgeous with an amazing bezel-less screen and some real power
       under the hood. Itʼs impressive, but itʼs more refinement than
       revolution.
       Samsung Galaxy S8
       Samsung Galaxy S8. Business Insider
       Tellingly, though, the Galaxy S8 ships with Bixby, a new virtual
       assistant that Samsung promises will one day let you control every
       single feature and app with just your voice. It will also ship with
       a new version of the Gear VR virtual reality headset, developed in
       conjunction with Facebookʼs Oculus.
       The next iPhone, too, is said to be shipping with upgrades to the
       Siri assistant, along with features aimed at bringing augmented
       reality into the mainstream.
       And as devices like the Amazon Echo, the Sony PlayStation VR, and
       the Apple Watch continue to enjoy limited but substantial success,
       expect to see a lot more tech companies large and small taking more
       gambles and making more experiments on the next big wave in
       computing interfaces.

The medium term
       In the medium term, all of these various experimental and
       first-stage technologies will start to congeal into something
       familiar but bizarre.
       Microsoft, Facebook, Google, and the Google-backed Magic Leap are
       all working to build standalone augmented-reality headsets, which
       project detailed 3D images straight into your eyes. Even Apple is
       rumored to be working on this.
       Microsoftʼs Alex Kipman recently told Business Insider that
       augmented reality could flat-out replace the smartphone, the TV,
       and anything else with a screen. Thereʼs not much use for a
       separate device sitting in your pocket or on your entertainment
       center if all your calls, chats, movies, and games are beamed into
       your eyes and overlaid on the world around you.
       apple airpods in ear
       At the same time, gadgetry like the Amazon Echo or Appleʼs own
       AirPods become more and more important in this world. As
       artificial-intelligence systems like Appleʼs Siri, Amazonʼs Alexa,
       Samsungʼs Bixby, and Microsoftʼs Cortana get smarter, there will be
       a rise not just in talking to computers but in having them talk
       back.
       In other words, computers will hijack your senses, more so than
       they already do, with your sight and your hearing intermediated by
       technology. Itʼs a little scary. Think of what Facebook glitches
       could mean in a world where it doesnʼt just control what you read
       on your phone but in what you see in the world around you.
       The promise, though, is a world where real life and technology
       blend more seamlessly. The major tech companies promise that this
       future means a world of fewer technological distractions and more
       balance, as the physical and digital world become the same thing.
       You decide how you feel about that.

The really crazy future
       Still, all those decade-plus investments in the future still rely
       on gadgetry that you have to wear, even if itʼs only a pair of
       glasses. Some of the craziest, most forward-looking, most
       unpredictable advancements go even further — provided youʼre
       willing to wait a few extra decades, that is.
       This week, we got our first look at Neuralink, a new company
       cofounded by Musk with a goal of building computers into our brains
       by way of "neural lace," a very early-stage technology that lays on
       your brain and bridges it to a computer. Itʼs the next step beyond
       even that blending of the digital and physical worlds, as human and
       machine become one.
       Assuming the science works — and lots of smart people believe that
       it will — this is the logical endpoint of the road that smartphones
       started us on. If smartphones gave us access to information and
       augmented reality puts that information in front of us when we need
       it, then putting neural lace in our brains just closes the gap.
       Ray Kurzweil
       Futurist Ray Kurzweil has been predicting our cyborg futures for a
       long time now. Tech Insider
       Musk has said this is because the rise of artificial intelligence —
       which underpins a lot of the other technologies, including voice
       assistants and virtual reality — means humans will have to augment
       themselves just to keep up with the machines. If youʼre really
       curious about this idea, futurist Ray Kurzweil is the leading voice
       on the topic.
       The idea of human/machine fusion is a terrifying one, with
       science-fiction writers, technologists, and philosophers alike
       having very good cause to ask what even makes us human in the first
       place. At the same time, the idea is so new that nobody really
       knows what this world would look like in practice.
       So if and when the smartphone dies, itʼll actually be the end of an
       era in more ways than one. Itʼll be the end of machines that we
       carry with us passively and the beginning of something that bridges
       our bodies straight into the ebb and flow of digital information.
       Itʼs going to get weird.
       And yet, lots of technologists already say that smartphones give us
       superpowers with access to knowledge, wisdom, and abilities beyond
       anything nature gave us. In some ways, augmenting the human mind
       would be the ultimate superpower. Then again, maybe Iʼm just an
       optimist.

       Donʼt be surprised when you eventually see a new rocketship tab in
       your Facebook app.
       The tab is essentially a second News Feed, except without any posts
       or baby pictures from your friends. Instead, Facebook is using the
       tab to only show recommended videos and articles based on what you
       already like and watch in your main News Feed.
       Facebook has been quietly testing the new tab in different parts of
       the world for the past several weeks, a company spokesperson told
       Business Insider.
       “We are testing a complementary feed of popular articles, videos,
       and photos, customized for each person based on content that might
       be interesting to them," the spokesperson said. "Weʼve heard from
       people that they want an easy way to explore new content they
       havenʼt connected with yet.”
       Facebook frequently tests changes to its apps that are never rolled
       out to all of its 1.8 billion users. But now that more people,
       including those in the US, are starting to see the rocketship tab,
       Facebook appears close to making the feature available to everyone.

     —Ryan Hoover (@rrhoover) April 2, 2017
       Creating a second News Feed could help Facebook overcome a looming
       threat to its ad business. The company has warned that itʼs nearing
       the limit of ads it can stuff into the News Feed, and this new tab
       could let it show more ads in videos and between stories.

            services — like Chrome, Gmail, or YouTube — or benefit from
            regular upgrades and security updates.
          + Though its widely known that the tech giantʼs Android platform
            has captured a mind-blowing share of the OS market, it has

            Principal Analyst at Forrester, told Business Insider.
          + Googleʼs control over Android, coupled with the fact that itʼs
            the only viable operating system for smartphone manufacturers
            today, has left Huawei in a seemingly impossible situation
            moving forward.

       Googleʼs Android operating system (OS) may be open source, but as
       we have been reminded this week, the tech giant has complete
       control over the apps and services that make its platform so
       valuable.
       Googleʼs firm grip on the Android ecosystem was on full display
       Sunday when Reuters reported the company would revoke its Android
       license from the Chinese manufacturing-giant, Huawei. The decision
       was reportedly made to comply with President Trumpʼs order barring
       trade with certain blacklisted Chinese companies.
       In one-fell-swoop, Google was able to restrict new Huawei devices
       in markets around the world from accessing its Google Play store
       and Google Play Services. That means, as long as Trumpʼs ban
       remains, Huawei manufactured devices will be allowed to run the
       open source version of Androidʼs OS, but they wonʼt benefit from
       system-level integration with popular apps and services — like
       Chrome, Gmail, or YouTube — or from regular upgrades and security
       updates, not to mention the loss of access to Googleʼs tremendous
       app store.
       Google did say existing Huawei users would still be able to access
       the Google Play app store and its built-in malware protection. On
       Tuesday, following the US governmentʼs decision to grant Huawei a
       90-day reprieve from the blacklist, Google said it would follow
       suit as well.
       "Keeping phones up to date and secure is in everyoneʼs best
       interests and this temporary license allows us to continue to
       provide software updates and security patches to existing models
       for the next 90 days," a Google spokesman told Business Insider in
       a statement.
       Despite the grace period, the impending blow could be catastrophic
       for Huaweiʼs smartphone business — which, as of earlier this month,
       was the second-largest in the world. Without access to an app store
       or services like Googleʼs Search or Maps, the options are grim.
       The company said back in March that the company was developing its
       own operating system, should sanctions be placed against them by
       the US. And on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Huawei has been in
       talks with European carriers and developers, pitching them on
       optimizing apps for the manufacturing giantʼs native platform.
       Read more: Huawei developed a ʼplan Bʼ operating system for
       smartphones in case it was banned by the US government from using
       Google products. Hereʼs what we know about it so far.
       But the likelihood of Huawei attracting developers to build
       applications for its OS — especially apps that are on the level
       that Google provides today — is unlikely, according to Carolina
       Milanesi, Principal Analyst at Creative Strategies.
       "You can build a different OS... but what are consumers going to do
       for search, for maps, for YouTube?" Milanesi told Business Insider
       in a recent interview. "All of these things have alternatives, but
       why would I do that? Itʼs not like Huaweiʼs phones are that amazing
       that I would forego all the services Iʼve been using for years."

There are actually two different Androids out there
       The situation in which Huawei finds itself shines a light on
       Googleʼs incredible power in the smartphone industry.
       Though itʼs widely known that the tech giantʼs Android platform has
       captured a mind-blowing share of the OS market — more than 85% of
       smartphones worldwide run on Android according to a recent IDC
       report — there are actually two different Androids: Thereʼs the
       official, Google version of Android that the company regularly
       updates (the latest version, Android Q, is currently in beta
       testing) and thereʼs Android Open Source Project (or, AOSP).
       Android Open Source is freely available for anyone to take, tinker
       with, and customize as they see fit.
       But if you want the version of Android that comes with all the
       latest security patches, integrated access to cutting-edge Google
       services like Assistant, and other benefits, you need to obtain a
       license from Google. (Though, it is important to note that the flow
       of Android updates is largely controlled by phone manufacturers and
       wireless carriers, who generally decide which devices get which
       patches, and when.)
       "Thereʼs a phonetics issue here," Forrester analyst Frank Gillett
       told Business Insider. "Thereʼs open-source, as in everyone can see
       the code and can contribute. And then thereʼs the — can you use it
       regardless of what Google thinks? And the answer is, no. You need
       permission from Google to use this stuff."
       Because of Androidʼs open-sourced nature, smartphones and tablets
       running the AOSP version can leave users with mixed, and sometimes
       sub-par, experiences.
       Packaging its services and restricting access to the official
       version, Gillett said, is Googleʼs way of creating more consistent
       interactions across the Android ecosystem. The introduction of
       Google Play Services in 2012 for example, allowed Google to instill
       organization and standards on one part of the Android world, while
       also ensuring that Google maintained tremendous power over the
       platform.
       "From a developers perspective, [Android] is open source," Milanesi
       said. "But Google puts a lot of extra work on it to optimize for
       its services in a way that benefits them."

Little to no options for Huawei
       In China today — where trade restrictions in the US are already in
       place — Huawei phones are running on a customized version of AOSP.
       Under the hood, itʼs all Android, but it has a proprietary look and
       feel that the company developed in-house.
       Users of those phones in China have some access to apps, like
       Gmail, but the devices lack other valuable services, like managed
       updates and security upgrades. For those users, little will change
       because of Googleʼs break with Huawei.
       But on a global market, where Huawei sells a huge amount of its
       products, Huawei phones run the Google version of Android, along
       with all the Google app consumers want, like Search, Maps, and
       Youtube. Those global consumers arenʼt going to accept a
       stripped-down experience, said Ben Bajarin, Principal Analyst at
       Creative Strategies.

       Shayanne Gal/Business Insider
       "[Huawei is] going to have to do something if this doesnʼt get
       resolved," Bajarin told Business Insider in a recent interview.
       "Theyʼre obviously not going to not sell phones. But theyʼre not
       going to have any success with a skinned version of Android."
       Should Huawei move forward with reports that itʼs going to create
       an Android alternative, history is not on its side. Samsung most
       recently tried its hand at creating its own OS — called Tizen — but
       the phones and its Linux-based platform havenʼt caught on. In a
       review of Samsungʼs Tizen, Ars Technica wrote that "it felt like a
       hollow copy of Android without any apps."
       The lack of viable options for Huawei to find (or build) an
       alternative OS have some questioning if Googleʼs Android should be
       considered a monopoly over the smartphone industry. If Google can
       cripple the second largest handset manufacturer with one, simple
       decision, than those concerns seem justified.
       Google has been subject to the recent "techlash," as politicians
       like Senator Elizabeth Warren have called for it to break off parts
       of its business that dominate industries, like Search. Regulating
       or breaking up Android, however, was not mentioned by Warren.
       Perhaps this weekʼs events will put increased pressure on Google to
       loosen its control over Android, or force other operating systems
       to ramp up their reach. In the end, though, Presidentʼs Trump
       blacklisting of Huawei could just be a bargaining chip in his
       broader trade wars with China. By next week, the order in the
       smartphone world may be restored.
       If not, things are about to get interesting.

       johnson resign prime minister
       UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Getty
          + Prime Minister Boris Johnsonʼs opponents have called on him to
            resign following Tuesdayʼs explosive verdict of the UK Supreme
            Court that his suspension of Parliament was illegal.
          + The court ruled that Johnsonʼs decision to close down
            Parliament was null and void.
          + The opposition Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said
            Johnson should consider his position and become the "shortest
            serving prime minister" ever.
          + Johnson has had a turbulent beginning to his premiership since
            he entered office in July. He has suffered a series of
            high-profile resignations, including that of his brother.
       The UK opposition Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, on Tuesday called
       on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to become the "shortest-serving
       prime minister" ever as Johnsonʼs opponents lined up to call for
       his resignation following the dramatic UK Supreme Court ruling that
       his decision earlier this month to suspend the UK Parliament was
       illegal.
       The explosive unanimous verdict means Johnson misled the Queen when
       he advised her to shut down Parliament. It came at the end of a
       turbulent period for Johnson, who has lost multiple votes in
       Parliament since becoming prime minister in July and suffered a
       series of resignations from his government, including that of his
       brother.

       Politicians representing all parts of the United Kingdom joined the
       chorus of calls for him to stand down immediately.
       Scottish National Party MP Joanna Cherry, who helped bring the case
       against Johnson, said the prime minister should now "do the decent
       thing and resign."
       "This is a huge victory for the rule of law and for democracy," she
       said outside the court in central London.
       She added: "His position is untenable and he should have the guts
       for once to the decent thing and resign."
       The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said "a prime
       minister with any honor would tender his resignation."

ʼThe final strawʼ

     —Sky News (@SkyNews) September 24, 2019
       The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, also said Johnson should
       stand down as a matter of honor.
       "Any normal Prime Minister would – as a matter of honour – tender
       their resignation after such a unanimous verdict from the UKʼs
       highest court," he tweeted.
       "It is the final straw in a pitiful episode for the country."
       The opposition Liberal Democrats called for Johnson to stand down
       and make way for a government of national unity.
       The prime minister, who was in New York meeting world leaders
       Tuesday at the UN General Assembly, did not immediately issue a
       statement about the verdict.
       He ignored questions from reporters about the issue as he entered
       the UN on Tuesday.

       Downing Street officials told The Guardian, however, that they
       would need to consider what they called an "extraordinary" ruling.
       Speaking with reporters on Monday, Johnson said he would not stand
       down and insisted he had suspended Parliament to set out a new
       program for government.
       Asked whether he would resign if the court ruled against him,
       Johnson replied "no," according to Politico.
       "I think the reasons for wanting a Queenʼs Speech were extremely
       good," he reportedly said.

          + Facebook said it recognized that moderation can be difficult
            but that employees "play a crucial role in helping create a
            safe environment for the Facebook community."
         ______________________________________________________________

       A former Facebook moderator said the pressure to churn through a
       never-ending pile of disturbing material eventually made her
       desensitized to child pornography and bestiality.
       Sarah Katz, 27, worked as a content reviewer at Facebookʼs
       headquarters in Menlo Park, California, through a third-party
       contractor, Vertisystem, for eight months in 2016. Her job was
       simple: figure out whether posts reported to Facebook violated the
       companyʼs detailed community standards.
       Practically, this meant eyeballing new and potentially horrific
       material every 10 seconds and making a snap decision about whether
       it needed to be ditched. Posts that needed reviewing were called
       "tickets," and there were about 8,000 every day.
       To deal with this onslaught, Facebook had 4,500 moderators like
       Katz on its books last year, and in May 2017 it announced plans to
       hire another 3,000 to help it in the fight against the darkest
       corners of its user output. Facebook is also investing in
       artificial intelligence to help police posts that break its rules.
       Facebook detailed the scale of its problem with prohibited content
       in a transparency report in May. It said that in the first three
       months of this year it "took action" on 21 million posts containing
       nudity and sexual activity and 3.4 million featuring graphic
       violence. Millions of posts with hate speech, spam, and terrorist
       content were also removed.

Reviewers have to sign a waiver document about offensive material
       Facebook waiver
       The waiver Katz signed before joining Facebook. Sarah Katz
       Content reviewers begin their Facebook journey by signing a waiver
       document, which basically acknowledges that they are braced to view
       the disturbing material. Itʼs also designed to protect Facebook
       from any potential legal action.
       The one Katz signed says moderators will be exposed to material
       that "may be offensive to some people," including pornographic
       images. It adds that staff members should "promptly notify"
       Facebook if they "do not wish to continue."
       "Facebook has billions of users, and people donʼt know how to use
       the platform correctly, so there was a lot of pornography,
       bestiality, graphic violence," Katz told Business Insider. "There
       was a lot of content that you might not expect to see shared on
       Facebook."
       Katz worked in an open-plan office in Menlo Park, where free snacks
       flowed and there was reasonable camaraderie among her colleagues.
       They would set to work on their queue of posts for review, and when
       in full flow, Katz would make decisions within seconds, she said.
       If ticket targets were not met, there would be consequences.
       Failing to hit a goal "once or twice" would result in a warning,
       Katz said; more than three times, "you would probably get let go."
       Katz said that she never witnessed this but that it was informally
       known among staff members.
       "Itʼs kind of a monotonous job after a while," she said. "You
       definitely grow desensitized to some of the graphic material
       because you see so much of it. A lot of the content tends to
       recirculate."

A sinister image that kept resurfacing
       Katz said there was a particularly sinister photo and video that
       popped up repeatedly in her queue.
       She said it featured two children between 9 and 12 years old
       standing facing each other, wearing nothing below the waist, and
       touching each other. It was clear, Katz said, that there was
       someone behind the camera telling them what to do.
       "It would go away and come back. It would appear at multiple times
       of the day," she said. "Each time the user location would be
       different — one day shared from Pakistan, another day the US. Itʼs
       kind of hard to track down the initial source."
       At the time, Katz said, she was not asked to report the accounts
       sharing the material — something she said "disturbed" her.
       "If the userʼs account was less than 30 days old, we would
       deactivate the account as a fake account," she said. "If the
       account was older than 30 days, we would simply remove the content
       and leave the account active."
       Facebook Menlo Park
       Inside Facebookʼs headquarters in Menlo Park, California. Reuters
       Her experience raises questions about the effectiveness of
       Facebookʼs efforts to tackle child exploitation on its platform.
       The company signed a deal with Microsoft in 2011 to use its
       PhotoDNA technology, designed to scan all images on Facebook and
       Instagram, flag known child porn, and prevent it from being
       reuploaded. Furthermore, Facebook moderators are trained to
       recognise and escalate such content internally when they see it.
       Facebook told the New York Post in 2012 that it reported all
       instances of child exploitation to the USʼs National Center for
       Missing and Exploited Children.
       "We have zero tolerance for child pornography being uploaded onto
       Facebook and are extremely aggressive in preventing and removing
       child exploitative content," a company spokesman said at the time.
       Katz said she was not aware that any of this was in place in 2016.
       "Facebook might have a policy [now] where youʼre supposed to report
       it, but back then they didnʼt," she said.
       Facebook declined to comment on the discrepancy between Katzʼs
       account and its stated policies.

The nuance of human perspective
       Katz is now a cybersecurity analyst for the cloud-computing firm
       ServiceNow and has written a sci-fi novel, "Apex Five," that draws
       inspiration from her time at Facebook. She is broadly upbeat about
       her Facebook experience, arguing that the downsides of the job were
       outweighed by the sense that she was protecting users.
       "There needs to be many human eyes to do the job, and it cannot all
       be allocated to artificial intelligence, no matter how much folks
       say," she said. "We will always be that nuance of human
       perspective. AI would help to track all that content from billions
       of users. The human element has to be taken care of, so we keep
       doing a good job."
       Mark Zuckerberg (Jake Kanter using for post)
       Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Reuters
       Katz urged tech firms to do more to make moderation a career rather
       than a short-term job.
       "It behooves not only Facebook but social-media platforms in
       general to hire content moderators on a full-time basis because
       provides much more incentive," she said. "It really incentivises us
       to do a stellar job and make it something we want to stick with,
       rather than winging it, holding out for something better."
       A Facebook spokeswoman said: "Our global team of content reviewers
       play a crucial role in helping create a safe environment for the
       Facebook community, which is our number one priority. We recognise
       that this work can often be difficult, so we have wellness and
       psychological support in place for all our staff.
       "Itʼs a really big job with more than 2 billion people on Facebook,
       so we recently added 3,000 people to our existing 4,500-strong
       community operations team around the world to review the millions
       of reports we get every week."

          + Morgan Stanley is cutting dozens of employees from its sales
            and trading staff as part of a year-end review, according to
            people with knowledge of the matter.
          + The bank will tell affected employees this week.
       Morgan Stanley is in the process of dismissing dozens of employees
       from its sales and trading staff.
       The cuts are being made to cull the firmʼs underperformers or
       reposition desks that may need fewer employees, according to people
       with knowledge of the matter. Itʼs part of an annual process, which
       the bank has made more rigorous in the past few years, one of the
       people said.
       The bank began alerting affected employees over the past week, as
       part of its annual promotion and compensation process, one of the
       people said. Next week, remaining employees will be told about
       their bonus figures and if they were up for a promotion — whether
       or not they got it.
       Some employees may not receive bonuses for 2018, whatʼs known in
       the industry as a doughnut or a bagel.
       A Morgan Stanley spokesman declined to comment on the layoffs.
       Morgan Stanley made headlines in 2015 when it announced a surprise
       25% cut to its fixed-income-business staff, a move that ultimately
       affected almost 500 people. This yearʼs cuts are much smaller and
       arenʼt part of a similar top-down cut, but a bottoms-up evaluation
       of individual business units and their headcounts, one of the
       people said.
       The cuts, which span the fixed-income, equities, and research
       divisions, affect less than 100 people. The unit has more than
       3,500 people globally.

          + Facebookʼs first president, Sean Parker, has been sharply

         ______________________________________________________________

       Sean Parker, the first president of Facebook, has a disturbing
       warning about the social network: "God only knows what itʼs doing
       to our childrenʼs brains."
       Speaking to the news website Axios, the entrepreneur and executive
       talked openly about what he perceives as the dangers of social
       media and how it exploits human "vulnerability."
       "The thought process that went into building these applications,
       Facebook being the first of them ... was all about: ʼHow do we
       consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?ʼ"
       said Parker, who joined Facebook in 2004, when it was less than a
       year old.
       "And that means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine
       hit every once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a
       photo or a post or whatever," he told Axios. "And thatʼs going to
       get you to contribute more content, and thatʼs going to get you ...
       more likes and comments."
       Parker added: "Itʼs a social-validation feedback loop ... exactly
       the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with,
       because youʼre exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology."
       "The inventors, creators — itʼs me, itʼs Mark [Zuckerberg], itʼs
       Kevin Systrom on Instagram, itʼs all of these people — understood
       this consciously," he said. "And we did it anyway."
       Facebook did not immediately respond to Business Insiderʼs request
       for comment.

Some in tech are growing disillusioned — and worried
       Parker isnʼt the only tech figure to express disillusionment and
       worry by what they helped create. Tristan Harris, a former Google
       employee, has been outspoken in his criticism of how tech
       companiesʼ products hijack usersʼ minds.
       "If youʼre an app, how do you keep people hooked? Turn yourself
       into a slot machine," he wrote in a widely shared Medium post in
       2016.
       "We need our smartphones, notifications screens and web browsers to
       be exoskeletons for our minds and interpersonal relationships that
       put our values, not our impulses, first," he continued. "Peopleʼs
       time is valuable. And we should protect it with the same rigor as
       privacy and other digital rights."

       In a recent feature, The Guardian spoke to tech workers and
       industry figures who have been critical of Silicon Valley business
       practices.
       Loren Brichter, the designer who created the slot-machine-like
       pull-down-to-refresh mechanism now widely used on smartphones,
       said, "Iʼve spent many hours and weeks and months and years
       thinking about whether anything Iʼve done has made a net positive
       impact on society or humanity at all."
       Brichter added: "Pull-to-refresh is addictive. Twitter is
       addictive. These are not good things. When I was working on them,
       it was not something I was mature enough to think about. Iʼm not
       saying Iʼm mature now, but Iʼm a little bit more mature, and I
       regret the downsides."
       And Roger McNamee, an investor in Facebook and Google, told The
       Guardian: "The people who run Facebook and Google are good people,
       whose well-intentioned strategies have led to horrific unintended
       consequences ... The problem is that there is nothing the companies
       can do to address the harm unless they abandon their current
       advertising models."
       The comments from Parker and others are further evidence of souring
       public sentiment about Silicon Valley. Once lauded in utopian
       terms, companies like Facebook have now come under heavy criticism
       over their role in the spread of "fake news" and Russian
       propaganda.
