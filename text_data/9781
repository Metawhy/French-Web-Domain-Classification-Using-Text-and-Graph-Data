Eclipse Foundation Website Privacy Policy

   May 24, 2018

   The Eclipse Foundation, Inc. ("Eclipse Foundation", "Us" or "We") is a
   member-supported not-for-profit foundation which acts as the steward of
   our open source projects, community, and ecosystem. We are committed to
   our community members’ rights to privacy. We promise to share
   transparently all aspects of how Eclipse Foundation projects and
   websites work in regards to privacy, terms, and personal data, and We
   are in full support of efforts to ensure your protection online. We
   only collect your personal data with your consent, and collect only as
   much as We need to provide you the service you request. For example, We
   need your personal data to register you to one of our conferences. Each
   time We collect additional personal data from you We will explain what
   We collect, why We need it, how We use it, how long We keep it, and how
   We protect it.

   You can withdraw consent anytime. We will respect your wishes.

Personal Information on Eclipse Foundation Websites

   As a platform for open source innovation and collaboration, personal
   information on all Eclipse Foundation websites is either meant to be
   shared, for example records of your contributions to our open source
   projects, or protected, such as your name and email address when you
   subscribe to our newsletter.

   Any personal data you share with Us, We protect according to this
   Privacy policy.

Individual Access to Personal Information

   We will respond within 30 days to your requests to have access to your
   personal information collected by Us. We will promptly correct
   inaccuracies, as the case may be, and We will delete it and/or
   anonymize it upon your request. Please contact privacy@eclipse.org to
   make such a request.

Information Security and Quality

   We protect the integrity of your personal information with appropriate
   technical and organizational measures, such as using encryption for
   transmission of certain forms of information, to help keep it secure,
   accurate, current, and complete.

   Your personal information may be stored in Canada, the European Union
   and the United States, always with our same high security standards.

   One of the primary purposes of the Eclipse Foundation and its websites
   is to enable collaborative open source software development. Doing so
   necessarily requires Us to maintain records of authorship related to
   all contributions. Any personally identifiable information collected by
   virtue of your contributions will be publicly available on the Internet
   in unencrypted form and without access restriction.

   We also offer services to our community which provide the ability for
   users of Eclipse software to store data on Eclipse Foundation servers
   through services including, but not limited to, the User Storage
   Service and the Automated Error Reporting Initiative. Any data stored
   through these services will be publicly available on the Internet in
   unencrypted form and without access restriction. Therefore, you should
   not use these services to store passwords, any personally identifiable
   information, any confidential business information, or anything else
   that you do not want to be generally and publicly available.

Clickstream Data and Cookies

   We sometimes collect anonymous information from visits and
   contributions to Eclipse Foundation websites to help provide better
   service. For example, We keep track of the domains from which people
   visit and We also measure visitor activity on Eclipse Foundation
   websites, but in ways that keep the information anonymous. This
   anonymous information is sometimes known as "clickstream data." We may
   use and aggregate this data to analyze trends and statistics and to
   help Us tailor our websites to better serve Eclipse participants.

   Some Eclipse Foundation website pages use cookies to better serve you
   when you return to the site. You can set your browser to notify you
   before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to
   accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do
   so, however, some areas of our sites may not function properly.

   Our sites may also set a session cookie to enable them to function
   properly. In such cases, the session cookie will only last for the
   length of your session, and the only information recorded will be that
   which is necessary to enable the website to function properly, and no
   personally identifiable information will be recorded in the session
   cookie.

Business Relationships

   This website contains links to other website. We are not responsible
   for the privacy practices or the content of such website.

   This privacy statement was last updated on May 24, 2018. A notice will
   be posted on this website home page for thirty (30) days whenever this
   privacy statement is changed.
