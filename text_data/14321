   My Grandparents’ Wedding Party.

   Banjarmasin, South Kalimantan, Indonesia (1965)

   Quite an Idyllic picture portraying not just the matrimony of two
   souls, but the gathering of tight-knit communities that presented
   throughout most Indonesian villages around this time, where families
   and friends lived closed by each other.

   An email submission from Neal:

   LariAnn and I went out on a couple of dates about a year after I got
   out of the Navy.  Dixon was her maiden name. She was really a nice
   person to know, but I was somewhat stupid back then. I never
   followed-up with her. Our big date was when we went to the Copacabana
   in NYC and saw the newly-formed group,The Supremes (sans Diana Ross).
   This was in 1966!  Great times back then.  I just took a shot and
   Googled Bride’s Magazine for Aug/Sep 1966 today and viola, there she
   was.  My friend called me back then to let me know that she was on the
   cover and the memory just crept back in recently. I never spoke with
   her again. Hope she had a happy life!  Neal O'Connor.
