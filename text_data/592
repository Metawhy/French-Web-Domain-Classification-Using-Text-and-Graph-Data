Boho Hello

   Hey there! I'm back today for the final day of the January Papertrey
   Ink countdown. Everything you've seen peeks of will be available
   tomorrow!
   And today I bring you one more sample of Boho Rounds, one of my new
   design for this month. I would have loved to have had more to share
   with you this release week, but life has been so crazy busy around
   here.
   [DSC_0588E.jpg]
    Here I've inked the half circle in gold ink and stamped it twice to
   make a complete round.
   [DSC_0607E.jpg]
   Check out that shine! I trimmed a small triangle corner from Luxe Gold
   cardstock and then finished the card off with a Smokey Shadow die cut
   "hello" from the Super Swoosh die collection. I stapled it all into
   place using a Tiny Attacher stapler.
   Well, that finishes up this months release for me. Just remember... all
   that you've seen today will be available for purchase
   through Papertrey Ink, beginning January 15th.
   Now, be sure to visit the Papertrey Ink blog for more crafty goodness.
   Thanks so much for stopping by!

Introducing Boho Rounds

   Hi there! Welcome to day three of the January Papertrey Ink countdown.
   For this months release I am adding a couple new additions to
   my Stamping Simply lineup.  On the 10th I shared a bit of Splits: Hello
   There with you here. Today I have a peek at the second one... Boho
   Rounds. Take a look...
   [DSC_0584E.jpg]
   This is my modern interpretation of the bohemian vibe thatâ€™s making a
   strong comeback in the fashion and decor world.  Included is this large
   half circle that can be used as is, stamped along an edge, or stamped
   twice to form a whole circular image. It is so easy to use and allows
   you to keep things super simple or get more in depth with techniques
   and layering!
   [DSC_0587E.jpg]
   Here I've inked the half circle in Scarlet Jewel, Raspberry Fizz, and
   Sweet Blush. Then I sprayed it with a bit of water, using a tiny
   mister, right before stamping. So much fun can be had with this image
   as well as the others in this stamp set, you can also color and paint
   these images by hand!  Make your own pattern paper or gorgeous focal
   point... it truly is a versatile stamp set! Be sure to visit Nichole
   Heady (here) and Betsy Veldman (here) for more ideas using this set.
   There are also coordinating die collection (Boho Rounds Sentiments)
   that I know you will love and use over and over again! But take note...
   these dies are are a larger version of the sentiment stamps, adding
   greater versatility to your stamp collection. Sadly I am still awaiting
   the arrival of mine.
   Well, there's a quick look from me at the latest from my Stamping
   Simply lineup. Just remember... everything showcased today will be
   available for purchase through Papertrey Ink, beginning January 15th.
   Thanks so much for stopping by!

Introducing Splits: Hello There

   Hi there! Welcome to day one of the January Papertrey Ink countdown.
   For this months release I bring you a couple new additions to
   my Stamping Simply lineup.  Today I have a peek at one of
   them... Splits: Hello There. Take a look...
   [DSC_0561E.jpg]
   This is the last of the Splits collection.  Insert sad face. But I
   think I'm finishing of with quite a bang. The geometric look of this
   months set is great for both masculine and feminine projects which
   makes it extra versatile. There's another fun detail included in the
   stamp set, but I will get to that later in the release.  Hint... Or you
   could just head on over to Nichole Heady's blog for a look at the
   extras included in this stamp set.
   [DSC_0564E.jpg]
   For today's cards I used the top and bottom parts of the frame to
   create a simple yet colorful pattern.
   [DSC_0581E.jpg]
   With this bold card front all that was needed to finish it off was a
   sentiment strip. Colors used here... Scarlet Jewel, Raspberry Fizz,
   Limeade Ice, and Soft Stone.
   [DSC_0552E.jpg]
   Here's one for the boys.
   [DSC_0555E.jpg]
   Colors used... Tropical Teal, Hawaiian Shores, Limeade Ice, and Soft
   Stone.
   Well, I hope you all have enjoyed the entire year of this Splits
   series, I feel it was a great addition to my Stamping Simply lineup. It
   stretched my abilities, helped me grow as a designer, and I enjoyed
   every moment of watching this collection come to life over the last 12
   months. Bonus for me, I LOVED seeing what you all created with these
   tiny stamp sets!
   That's it from me today! Just remember... everything showcased today
   will be available for purchase through Papertrey Ink, beginning January
   15th. Also, see more of the set (plus the other set of mine that's
   debuting this month Boho Rounds + Boho Rounds Sentiments dies) at
   Nichole Heady's blog. Visit Betsy Veldmen and Ashley Newell too for
   even more!

Congratulations on Your New Baby Girl

   Hey there! I'm back today for the final day of the December Papertrey
   Ink countdown. Everything you've seen peeks of will be available
   tomorrow!
   And of course I bring you one more sample of Swan'sational, one of my
   new design for this month.
   [DSC_0535E.jpg]
   This set is perfect for baby cards. I used twin facing swans, placed
   them next to one another, and then nestle a sweet little baby just
   below the pair. The parents were made using the swan die, and orange
   marker (for the beak) and the small black accent stamp.
   [DSC_0544E.jpg]
   If you need a card to celebrate a new baby girl, use a pink ribbon.  If
   it's for a newborn boy, use a blue ribbon.
   Well, that finishes up this months release for me. Just remember... all
   that you've seen today will be available for purchase
   through Papertrey Ink, beginning December 15th.
   Now, be sure to visit the Papertrey Ink blog for more crafty goodness.

With Love Card Duo

   Hi folks! Welcome to day four of the December Papertrey Ink countdown.
   [DSC_0508E.jpg]
   Today I've got another look at Splits: With Love for ya.
   [DSC_0505E.jpg]
   I've thought a little out of the box when it came to putting these
   cards together.
   [DSC_0521E.jpg]
   Here's the frame stamped in a not so frame way. Does that even make
   sense?! Anyways, I've used only a portion of the stamp along the edge
   of a white cardstock panel.  For reference, you can see the frame image
   in its original formation on this sample here.
   [DSC_0525E.jpg]
   I inked the frame stamp in sweet blush, pure poppy, and raspberry fizz.
   Then carefully stamped only the blooms along the edge. Stamped the
   sentiment near the corner and finished the card off with a few clear
   rhinestones.
   [DSC_0513E.jpg]
   Included in this stamp set are a few extra images.
   [DSC_0514E.jpg]
   This one-layer card was stamped using the tiny triangle trio stamp, a
   simple image that can be stamped repeatedly to create a very unique
   pattern. Such as the one here, placed around the sentiment.
   That's it from me today! Just remember... the Splits: With Love stamp
   set and its coordinating dies will be available for purchase
   through Papertrey Ink, beginning December 15th.
   Now, be sure to visit Papertrey Ink blog for more on today's featured
   product.

Swan Birthday Wishes

   Hello and welcome to day three of the December Papertrey Ink countdown!

   [DSC_0490E.jpg]
   I'm back today with another sample using the new Swan'sational. Here
   I've created a swan scene using only two images from this set.
   [DSC_0497E.jpg]
   The grouping of swans were stamped in soft stone and then a row of
   cattails were stamped along the bottom edge in simply chartreuse. The
   sentiment was inked and stamped in scarlet jewel to complete this
   simple one-layer wonder card.
   Well, there's a quick look at Swan'sational. Just remember... Just
   remember... everything showcased today will be available for purchase
   through Papertrey Ink, beginning December 15th.
   Now, be sure to visit Papertrey Ink blog for more details on these and
   other products that are featured today.
   Thanks so much for stopping by!

Introducing Splits: With Love

   Hi there! Welcome to day two of the December Papertrey Ink countdown.
   For this months release I bring you a couple new additions to
   my Stamping Simply lineup.  Today I have a peek at second
   one... Splits: With Love. Take a look...
   [DSC_0484E.jpg]
   These scribbled florals can be colored in and even accented with the
   included leaves. Tuck the "With Love" sentiment into the frame, mix and
   match with other Splits sets, or use a sentiment from another set for
   more options.
   [DSC_0488E.jpg]
   For this one-layer wonder I inked up this sweet frame in three
   colors... summer sunrise, scarlet jewel, and plum pudding. The leaves
   were added using the color simply chartreuse. A small silky bow is the
   perfect touch to give this simple card a little something extra, I
   easily formed the bow and attached it with a touch of adhesive.
   Well, there's a quick look from me at the latest from my Stamping
   Simply lineup. Just remember... everything showcased today will be
   available for purchase through Papertrey Ink, beginning December 15th.
   Thanks so much for stopping by!
