Up Close & Personal With SuspiciousMinds

   Reginald Van de Velde (Belgium, 1975) scouts the unknown and the
   unseen. As a wanderer of wastelands he journeys all over the world,
   trying to capture the momentum of splendour still undisturbed by the
   turmoil and temptations of modern society. He is a vagabond for lost
   beauty, a chronicler of forgotten magnificence.

   His work has been exhibited internationally in both solo and group
   expos, including The Art & Science Museum (Singapore), Backlight Photo
   Festival (Finland), New York Photo Festival (USA), Siena International
   Photography Festival (Italy), The Somerset House (UK) and the Cannes
   Lions International Festival (France).

   His excellence in photography has been awarded numerous times: winner
   at the Triennial Barbaix Awards for Photography (Belgium), winner at
   the Grand Prix de la Découverte (France), winner at the Cannes Lions
   International Festival (France), finalist at the World Photography
   Awards (UK), finalist at the Siena International Photography Awards
   (Italy), and winner of the Grand Prix at the Seoul International
   Photography Festival (South-Korea).

   Selected publications include Esquire Magazine, Wired, Aesthetica
   Magazine, The Plus Paper, National Geographic, Sabato, F11 Magazine, De
   Tijd, BBC, Photo Magazine Hong Kong, The World Photography Book and the
   Beauty in Decay book to name but a few.

   “Between Nowhere & Never” is the title of Reginald’s first coffee table
   book – the epitome of ten years of photography. Published by Luster
   Books in Belgium and available in bookstores worldwide, this book marks
   a major milestone in Reginald’s photographic journey.

Life Framer World Travelers

     * news

   [reginaldVandeVelde_winner_LifeFramer.jpg]

   Just in: I’m a winner at the Life Framer photography competition! My
   image of this neglected monument won in the World Travelers category.
   What makes this award so special is the fact that all works were juried
   by the legendary photographer Steve McCurry – who made the iconic
   “Afghan Girl” portrait featured on the cover of National Geographic
   back in 1985. Steve, I owe you one.

   All winning entries will be shown at the renowned “Les Rencontres
   d’Arles” festival in France during the summer holidays! Anyone down at
   the Côte d’Azur for some pastis?

Civilization – The Way We Live Now

     * expo

   [landscapesWithin_17.jpg]

   Dear friends,

   I am incredibly delighted to share some extraordinary news with you.

   Part of my series “Landscapes Within” will be shown in a group expo
   called “Civilization: The Way We Live Now”. The show will travel the
   globe doing all major musea worldwide. This mammoth of an expo will
   feature top names like Edward Burtynsky, Nadav Kander, Robert Polidori
   and Olaf Otto Becker.

   In all fairness: these photographers are my absolute heroes! I
   literally have all their books. They’re not just heroes, they’re true
   legends. Safe to say I’m extremely honoured – and humbled – to be able
   to show my work alongside these masters of photography.

   The inaugural opening is on Wednesday 17th of October at the National
   Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Seoul, South Korea. The expo
   itself is curated by William Ewing and is produced by the Foundation
   for the Exhibition of Photography (FEP).

   As one of the featured photographers I’m also included in the upcoming
   book release Civilization, by Thames & Hudson. The book launch is at
   the Flowers Gallery in London, on November the 5th, in partnership with
   Photo London.

   Apart from all the fine photos and works there will be artist talks and
   symposia as well.
