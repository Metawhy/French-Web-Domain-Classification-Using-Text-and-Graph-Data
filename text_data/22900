Overview

   This web site presents theoretical results about special traveling wave
   solutions of continuum traffic models. We consider mathematical
   equations that model traffic similar to the equations of fluid flow.
   Specifically, we consider the Payne-Whitham model, the Aw-Rascle model,
   and generalizations thereof. In the simplest case, a single-lane,
   straight, and uniform road is considered. The models are purely
   deterministic. All drivers behave according to the same laws, and fully
   predictably. The considered traffic models predict a nice, uniform
   traffic flow at low traffic densities. However, above a critical
   threshold density (that depends on the model parameters) the flow
   becomes unstable, and small perturbations amplify. This phenomenon is
   typically addressed as a model for phantom traffic jams, i.e. jams that
   arise in the absence of any obstacles. The instabilities are observed
   to grow into traveling waves, which are local peaks of high traffic
   density, although the average traffic density is still moderate (the
   highway is not fully congested). Vehicles are forced to brake when they
   run into such waves. In analogy to other traveling waves, so called
   solitons, we call such traveling traffic waves jamitons.

   Our research is based on the observation that the considered traffic
   models are similar to the equations that describe detonation waves
   produced by explosions. Employing the theory of denotation waves, we
   have developed ways to analytically predict the exact shape and the
   speed of propagation of jamitons. Numerical simulations of the
   considered traffic models show that the predicted jamiton solutions are
   in fact achieved, if the initial traffic density is sufficiently dense.
   The considered jamitons can qualitatively be found both in observed
   real traffic as well as in experiments. The theoretical description of
   the jamiton solution admits a better understanding of their behavior.

   Our work also demonstrates that jamitons can serve as an explanation of
   multi-valued fundamental diagrams of traffic flow that are observed in
   measurement data. In these, the spread in measurement data is caused by
   the unsteadiness of jamiton solutions in a systematic and predictable
   fashion. While the multi-valued nature in real fundamental diagrams is
   most likely due to a variety of effects, our studies show that traffic
   waves must not be neglected in the explanation of this phenomenon.

   Further findings of our research are trains of multiple jamitons that
   can occur on long roads. In the language of detonation theory, such
   traffic roll waves are very similar to roll waves in shallow water
   flows. Moreover, on long periodic roadways, final states can arise that
   consist of multiple jamitons. Interestingly, these individual jamitons
   can be quite different from each other, resulting in highly complex
   traffic behavior, even after long times of traffic equilibration.

Theoretical Results

   We consider continuum two-equation ("second order") traffic models,
   such as the Payne-Whitham or the Aw-Rascle equations for traffic flow.
   The traffic flow is not modeled as individual vehicles. Instead, the
   evolution of a continuous vehicle density function and a continuous
   velocity function is described. We consider inviscid models, i.e. any
   smoothing exchange of momentum between neighboring vehicles is
   neglected. While in reality a small amount of viscosity is obviously
   present, the inviscid model can be interpreted as a limiting case that
   admits a simpler analysis. The considered models are purely
   deterministic, and all drivers behave according to the same laws.

   Phantom traffic jams

   It is well known that two-equation traffic models are linearly unstable
   for sufficiently large densities. In other words: A chain of
   equidistant vehicles that move all with the same velocity will not
   remain in this nice configuration. Instead, a small perturbation grows,
   and builds up to become a wave of high vehicle density. This phenomenon
   is called phantom traffic jam, since it arises in free flowing traffic,
   without any obvious reason, such as obstacles, bottlenecks, etc.
   Instabilities in traffic flow and the onset of phantom traffic jams
   have been studied extensively in various types of traffic models. In
   continuum traffic models, there are two competing effects. On the one
   hand there is a stabilizing traffic pressure due to preventive driving.
   On the other hand, there is a destabilizing effect, which comes from
   the combination of drivers slowing down when the vehicle density is
   higher and a delay in the adjustment of drivers to new conditions (the
   adjustment time is inverse to the "aggressiveness" of the drivers). If
   the density is above a certain threshold, then the destabilizing effect
   outweighs the stabilizing pressure, and small perturbations grow.

   Jamitons

   While the instability that leads to a local concentration of vehicles
   is understood and reported in many papers, the exact shape of the final
   traffic jam wave has not been addressed in traffic literature. Our
   studies show that in inviscid Payne-Whitham type traffic models,
   instabilities grow into traveling detonation waves. These consist of a
   sharp jump in vehicle density (a shock) on one side, and a smooth decay
   in density on the other side. These detonation waves are stable
   structures that travel unchanged with a constant velocity along the
   road. In analogy to traveling waves in other fields, solitons, we
   decided to christen the traveling traffic waves jamitons.

   Properties of jamitons

   Our analysis is able to predict fundamental properties of such
   jamitons. A central result is that sharp shocks must always face
   towards incoming vehicles. Furthermore it can be proved that jamitons
   always travel slower than the individual vehicles. Hence, vehicles run
   into a sharp and sudden increase in density (the end of a phantom
   traffic jam), which forces each vehicle to brake very suddenly. Then,
   vehicles accelerate again our of the jamiton. Our analysis also shows
   that jamitons are stable structures. They can only vanish by strong
   smoothing effects (extremely cautious drivers) or a lowering of density
   (a widening road, vehicles exiting).

   Jamitinos

   A growing jamiton may trigger a new instability downstream the road.
   This instability can also grow and become another traveling wave. A
   jamiton has given birth to another traffic wave: a jamitino. In a
   similar fashion, the second traveling wave may trigger a third wave,
   and so on. Thus, a single instability can trigger an infinitely growing
   sequence of jamitinos. This phenomenon is visible in the videos below.
   It resembles roll waves in shallow water flows.

   Conclusions for traffic modeling

   For simple traffic laws, the shape of jamitons can be described
   exactly, allowing a precise prediction of the maximum traffic density
   that is achieved in the presence of instabilities. This result is
   fundamentally based on the exact shape of the traveling traffic waves,
   and traditional analysis of continuum traffic models has not been able
   to make such predictions. Furthermore, having a description of the
   nonlinear traffic waves allows a study of the traffic outcome in
   dependence on the model parameters, such as anticipation and
   aggressiveness of the drivers. While one jamiton does not delay the
   travel time of individual vehicles significantly (vehicles travel
   through a jamiton rather quickly), the sharp jump in vehicle density is
   a potential hot spot for accidents. In addition, the results indicate
   that jamitons rarely stay alone. In practice, whole trains of jamitons
   can be expected in long stretches of heavy traffic, resulting in
   significantly increased fuel consumption, driver aggrevation, wear and
   tear on materials, and risk for accidents. Consequently, a detailed
   understanding of the structure of and the interaction between jamitons
   can be a fundamental step in understanding the mechanics of traffic
   flow, and thus working towards ameliorating the above effects.

Results for a Circular Road

   A circular road is a particular friendly case for an analysis, since
   the total number of vehicles is exactly conserved. If the road is not
   too long, traffic will in general form one single traveling wave, i.e.
   a single jamiton, and thus a single shock is observed. Below figures
   and videos show the results of simulations and theoretical predictions
   for the case of a circular road of length 230m.

   In the case of inviscid equations a sharp shock is realized. Here, the
   final solution is predicted theoretically. The match between theory and
   numerical results is generally very good. While the inviscid equations
   allow a simple analysis, using the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions at the
   shock, the resulting vehicle behavior is somewhat extreme. Vehicles
   slow down from high to low velocity in zero time.

   In real traffic flow, a small viscosity is present. The physical
   rationale is that a fast vehicle running towards a slow vehicle results
   in the fast vehicle slowing down, and (to some extent) the slow vehicle
   speeding up, before a minimum distance is reached. Unlike above
   described traffic parameters (adjustment time, preventive driving), the
   nature of viscosity is difficult to model and extract from real traffic
   flow. The inviscid equations are expected to be a good approximation to
   real traffic with a small viscosity.

   For comparison, below are simulation results for viscous traffic
   equations. The general behavior is similar to the inviscid case. In
   particular, again a traveling wave solution is obtained. However, now
   with continuous density and velocity functions (the shock is smoothed
   out). As a result, vehicles brake earlier and more smoothly.

  Comparison with Experimental Results

   In March 2008, Sugiyama et al. have published an article Traffic jams
   without bottlenecks - Experimental evidence for the physical mechanism
   of the formation of a jam in the New Journal of Physics, in which they
   report experimental results of traffic waves. On a circular road of
   230m length, 22 vehicles were placed equidistantly, and the drivers
   were instructed to drive, trying to preserve a fixed distance and fixed
   velocity. As the video below shows, small instabilities amplify, and a
   traveling arises that moves backwards on the road. Sugiyama et al.
   conclude: Finally, a jam cluster appears and propagates backward like a
   solitary wave with the same speed as that of a jam cluster on a
   highway.

   [EMBED]

   In our simulations, a circular road of 230m length is considered. The
   desired velocity resembles the velocity in the experiment. A comparison
   of our computational results for 22 vehicles with the experimental
   result reveals strong similarities. While there is no one-to-one match
   in every detail, we do believe that the solitary wave found in the
   experiment is the same as the jamiton we find analytically and by
   numerical experiment.

Results for an Infinite Road

   Below videos show simulations of a long road with a small initial
   perturbation. The instability grows into a jamiton. The shape of the
   jamiton converges to the theoretically predicted shape. In addition, a
   train of jamitinos is triggered, each of which grows to an
   independently traveling jamiton.

  Comparison with Real Traffic

   A nice video of emergent phantom traffic jams (copyright: Dirk Helbing)
   shows a long straight road in Cairo, Egypt. Strong similarities with
   the above simulations are present. The typical shape of jamitons is
   visible, as well as their ability to travel backwards on the road.
   Unfortunately, too many perturbations (on- and off ramps, interactions
   between multiple lanes) prevent an unperturbed evolution. In
   particular, roll waves, as predicted by our simulations, are not
   clearly visible here. We would love to hear of any observations of
   traffic roll waves.

Explanation of Multi-Valued Fundamental Diagrams

   Our studies show that jamitons have a very specific profile: when
   plotted in a flow rate vs. density diagram, a jamiton is a straight
   line segment, whose slope is the travel velocity of the jamiton on the
   road. As such, jamitons form a two-parameter family of curves. As a
   first parameter, one can choose the vehicle density at the sonic point.
   For each such density (if the associated uniform flow is unstable), one
   obtains a maximum jamiton curve (infinitely long), and a one-parameter
   family of sub-jamitons, parametrized by their length (or their shock
   height, respectively).

     Jamiton-induced fundamental diagram together with measurement data
                      [fig_fd_ar_with_data_small.png]

   The figure above shows a fundamental diagram, induced by jamitons. The
   black function is the equilibrium curve that vehicles relax towards. In
   the regime of densities marked by red dots, uniform traffic flow (of
   the respective density) is unstable, and jamitons arise. For each red
   dot (sonic point density), the maximal possible jamiton is marked by a
   green dotted line segment. Moreover, we calculate how any train of
   sub-jamitons would appear to a stationary sensor that records flow rate
   and density in an aggregated fashion (e.g., in intervals of 30
   seconds). The resulting averages are given by the blue line segments,
   and their envelopes by the pink curves. Any point enclosed by the pink
   curves can arise as a sensor measurement of jamitons states. This
   construction is placed on top of real sensor measurement data (obtained
   on the southbound direction of I-35W in Minneapolis, MN; data provided
   by the Minnesota Department of Transportation). A strong qualitative
   agreement between the jamiton construction and the data is apparent.

Conclusions

   The observation that simple, purely deterministic traffic models
   possess jamiton solutions indicates that phantom traffic jams are not
   necessarily caused by individual drivers behaving in a "wrong" way. In
   fact, they can even occur if all drivers behave by the exact same laws.
   In the considered traffic models, two key effects work towards the
   occurrence of phantom traffic jams: first, denser traffic travels
   slower; and second, it takes a certain "adjustment time" for drivers to
   react to new traffic conditions. These effects are counter-acted by a
   certain tendency of the drivers to drive preventively. In light
   traffic, the good effects dominate. In heavy traffic, the bad effects
   prevail. Hence, phantom traffic jams are a feature of traffic flow that
   is not completely avoidable.

   Benefits of a better understanding of jamitons

   Real traffic possesses jamitons. Hence, a better understanding of their
   structure can be beneficial for the simulation and prediction of real
   highway traffic. Furthermore, the research can be one step towards
   answering the key question "how can the occurrence of phantom traffic
   jams be avoided". The occurrence of jamitons depends on the model
   parameters, such as road capacities, speed limits, and driving
   behavior. A deeper understanding of jamitons may give indications on
   how to lower peak densities, and how to shift the critical threshold
   density at which jamitons occur upwards. The latter may be achieved by
   electronic driving assistence hardware that helps drivers (in a subtle
   fashion) to accelerate and decelerate more smoothly, and thus to make
   the occurrence of jamitons less likely.
