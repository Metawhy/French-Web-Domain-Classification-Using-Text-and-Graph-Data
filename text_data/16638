   Sara Whitestone, 24 years old, an American graduate student from the
   University of Cincinnati, arrived in Bordeaux in the summer of 2016.
   Holding a Bachelor of science (major in Neuroscience, minor in
   communication), she was set to start the two year International Master
   of Neuroscience at the University of Bordeaux.

Why did you choose to come to the University of Bordeaux?

   I was ready for a new challenge in 2016!  I had never been abroad,
   didn‚Äôt speak French so what better challenge than to start the highly
   competitive and intensive international Master‚Äôs program in
   Neuroscience in Bordeaux!

   Since 2010, I have been living with my disease known as POTS (Postural
   Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome ‚Äì see below for more information), and
   this sparked my interest and passion for neuroscience. In 2016, I
   wanted to pursue a Master‚Äôs degree that offered a ‚Äúhands-on‚Äù,
   international, research environment. The program here in Bordeaux
   offered full-time research opportunities as well as the possibility to
   learn about recent neuroscience efforts on a global scale so it was a
   perfect fit.

What was your learning experience like?

   The International Master of Neuroscience was, as expected, a very
   intense learning experience with a strong focus on technical research
   skills. This meant that I was able to do what I like best ‚Äì carry out
   my own experiments and research. I even managed to co-author two
   publications based on the research completed during my internship. In
   terms of teaching, a large variety of professors, with differing
   specialties, participated in the classes and this was very valuable for
   knowledge transmission.

What have you discovered with this international experience?

   Compared to my undergraduate experience, I found the lectures to be
   very long and organized differently. I appreciated when teachers used a
   "flipped classroom" approach, and encouraged interaction ‚Äì this
   definitely facilitated my learning. What I preferred was hearing
   directly from clinicians and researchers when they presented their work
   in the classroom. As for the exams, I initially found the lengthy,
   comprehensive format difficult, but eventually (and luckily!) I learned
   how to adapt!

What are your impressions of Bordeaux?

   Bordeaux seems quintessentially French to me. In addition to being
   charming, the city is also very student friendly and a very manageable
   size ‚Äì especially now that I manage without my wheelchair, I love how
   ‚Äúwalkable‚Äù it is. My favorite activity is to walk along the streets at
   night after a rain shower... As it rains pretty often here, this is
   something I can do on a regular basis!

What are your next objectives here in Bordeaux?

   Despite major health issues during the second semester of my Master
   year 2, with the help and support of my professors and classmates, I
   was able to complete the program and graduated successfully in
   September 2018. My next challenge is to hopefully begin my PhD in
   Neuroscience ‚Äì just as soon as some funding issues are resolved‚Ä¶ I also
   really want to continue improving my French language skills.

Where do you see yourself in 10 years?

   My motto is ‚Äúhope for the best but prepare for the worst‚Äù ‚Äì so all in
   all, a positive outlook but given my condition, I always have to be
   ready to tackle challenges. My focus is on what matters most, so in the
   future I hope to be living somewhere that provides sufficient support
   for my illness while I contribute actively to the research that is
   carried out on dysautonomia.

   Today, I am grateful that my health allows me to live and study
   independently. I am however aware that my quality of life may change
   anytime with any infection, virus or complication. Thankfully, in
   France, even as an expat, I feel reassured by the institutional
   protections and affordability of the healthcare system. I now have
   access to a medication I could not afford in the US! The support of
   this healthcare system as well as from my professors have allowed me to
   manage both my complicated chronic health issues and to continue to
   study here at the same time.

   There is, however, still a lot of progress to be made in terms of
   accessibility. I ask myself the question: How do we actively recruit
   and support disabled scientists? For example, if I ever have to use a
   wheelchair again, could I continue to physically do the same
   experiments? I look forward to contributing to these accessibility
   questions and efforts in the future, and I hope that by speaking
   publically about my experiences it might help others as well.

Sara spins!

   In 2010, Sara was diagnosed with a form of dysautonomia known as POTS
   (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome). A circulatory disorder,
   this condition may cause an abnormal heart rate, headaches, nausea and
   even fainting upon standing.

   This neurological disease resulted in chronic fatigue so severe for
   Sara that she was house bound from 2010 until 2012 when she graduated
   from high-school. In 2012 the ‚ÄúSara Spins‚Äù foundation was created in
   order to raise the necessary funds for a motorized wheelchair that
   would enable Sara to access the University of Cincinnati campus. In
   2014, she started receiving biofeedback treatment and heart rate
   training to help control the physical reactions to stress and later
   that year was finally able to walk again!

   Today Sara continues to manage and battle her disorder along with her
   studies, research and life. The ‚ÄúSara Spins‚Äù foundation is ongoing,
   raising awareness and support for other students with disabilities. For
   more information, please consult the website: www.saraspins.org
