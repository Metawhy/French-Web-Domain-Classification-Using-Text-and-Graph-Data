Software bankers use and love

   If bankers don’t use the software, nothing else matters. Our solution
   was built for relationship managers, to enable better client
   conversations.

   It gathers data without requiring time-consuming and redundant data
   entry. RMs know in the moment if each deal meets the terms of the bank
   and the client.

Structure and price to win

   RMs make data-driven decisions as they craft personalized client
   scenarios and see 360 views of each relationship. They customize
   pricing assumptions and deal terms, compare options relative to the
   bank’s proﬁtability targets and competitive offers. The result:
   profitable, winning deals that shape the relationship.

   actions, gathering data. She delivers hyper-focused recommendations for
   this specific client, with this relationship, in this industry, in this
   market. She delivers suggestions at the moment of truth, when the deal
   is being structured and priced.

     It tackles a really complex thing like asset structuring and all
     those really important things that you need, but the rollout is
     very, very efficient. I think that’s a testament to the architecture
     of the software.

     We're no longer just talking about this loan or that loan. We're

     Using PrecisionLender early and up front affords us the luxury,
     before we consume a lot of resources internally, to say, “Can we get
     the pricing that we need to meet our shareholder objectives?” If
     not, we’ll gracefully exit the situation.
