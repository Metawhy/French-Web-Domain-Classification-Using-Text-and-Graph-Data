   The Game Is About Glory.

   The words of our 1961 Double-winning captain Danny Blanchflower
   reverberate around Tottenham Hotspur and everything we do, to this day
   and into the future.

   We are about playing with flair, style and passion. Players, coaches,
   staff and fans – we move forward, together as one.

   We’re so proud of our rich history. From humble beginnings in North
   London, we became the first and, to date, only non-league side to win
   the FA Cup in 1901 – the first of eight triumphs in the age-old,
   world-renowned competition thus far.

   In 1951, we won the English First Division league title for the first
   time, just 12 months after coming up from the Second Division as
   champions. And 10 years later, we reached even greater heights,
   becoming the first team in the modern era to complete the league and FA
   Cup double.

   Bill Nicholson was our manager then, but he was so much more than just
   a manager. He was Mr Tottenham. A former player of ours, he lived and
   breathed Tottenham Hotspur, guiding us to huge success in his 16 years
   at the helm. Under his stewardship, we became the first British team to
   win a major European trophy with European Cup Winners’ Cup glory in
   1963, collected further FA Cups in 1962 and 1967, won the League Cup in
   1971 and 1973 and tasted European success once more by lifting the 1972
   UEFA Cup.

   Further FA Cup, UEFA Cup and League Cup trophies followed throughout
   the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, leading us to up to the present day where
   we strive to innovate and amaze in pursuit of more silverware.

   We’re hungry, we’re progressive, we’ve built a brand new world-class
   Training Centre and moved into an outstanding, modern new stadium,
   overlapping the site of White Hart Lane, where we played our home games
   for 118 years.

   The Game Is About Glory.

   The words of our 1961 Double-winning captain Danny Blanchflower
   reverberate around Tottenham Hotspur and everything we do, to this day
   and into the future.

   We are about playing with flair, style and passion. Players, coaches,
   staff and fans – we move forward, together as one.

   We’re so proud of our rich history. From humble beginnings in North
   London, we became the first and, to date, only non-league side to win
   the FA Cup in 1901 – the first of eight triumphs in the age-old,
   world-renowned competition thus far.

   In 1951, we won the English First Division league title for the first
   time, just 12 months after coming up from the Second Division as
   champions. And 10 years later, we reached even greater heights,
   becoming the first team in the modern era to complete the league and FA
   Cup double.

   Bill Nicholson was our manager then, but he was so much more than just
   a manager. He was Mr Tottenham. A former player of ours, he lived and
   breathed Tottenham Hotspur, guiding us to huge success in his 16 years
   at the helm. Under his stewardship, we became the first British team to
   win a major European trophy with European Cup Winners’ Cup glory in
   1963, collected further FA Cups in 1962 and 1967, won the League Cup in
   1971 and 1973 and tasted European success once more by lifting the 1972
   UEFA Cup.

   Further FA Cup, UEFA Cup and League Cup trophies followed throughout
   the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, leading us to up to the present day where
   we strive to innovate and amaze in pursuit of more silverware.

   We’re hungry, we’re progressive, we’ve built a brand new world-class
   Training Centre and moved into an outstanding, modern new stadium,
   overlapping the site of White Hart Lane, where we played our home games
   for 118 years.
