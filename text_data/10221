Premiere: Havania Whaal "Horizon"

     Portland, Oregon duo, Havania Whaal are preparing to release their
     EP, Babcia on September 20th via Seattle's Youth Riot Records.
     Surviving the Golden Age is excited to premiere the EP's latest
     single, "Horizon." With lyrics about "driving away from your home
     town and who you become in that journey," the track feels like a
     dream.


Why The Seattle Music Scene Is A Glimpse At The Future

     Why The Seattle Music Scene Is A Glimpse At The Future subscribe to
     All Songs Considered podcast Most cities tend to have a voice, but
     few quite as loud or interesting as Seattle's. This is a city that
     gave us Jimi Hendrix, Nirvana and Pearl Jam but also the softer,
     more introspective sounds of Fleet Foxes, The Postal Service and
     Death Cab for Cutie.

Under Review: Primp, Mother Loose

     Mother Loose, a two sided single from Vancouver gals Primp, is the
     latest in an evolutionary process that has taken the band from lo-fi
     through power pop to garage rock. Cheekily scrawled in the liner
     notes on Primp's Bandcamp page, "This is the last of allie's breakup
     tracks (for now...)


Beyond Grunge: 15 Artists Redefining Seattle Music

     In 1989, Seattle music was approaching its breaking point - the
     point at which it would travel beyond the marine layer hovering
     above our grey waters and thrust itself into the public
     consciousness. You know the names: Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden,
     Alice in Chains.


Docks - Ballast EP

     The recording project of Manon Raupp and Daniel Selig, French duo
     Docks makes a distinctive brand of instrumental music, touching upon
     post-rock, slowcore and dream pop to create what the band describe
     as 'snoozepop'.

Sounds: Funny Face House // Magnolia

     You know what I love about this world of polished-to-perfection pop
     music? All the bands who ditch the high-priced recording studios,
     in-the-box recording process, endless editing, and autotune to wind
     up with a gritty, dirty, lo-fi tune with the one thing so many pop
     hits can never quite attain: character.

Sleepover Club's 'My Other Dad Is Your Ride'

     Everett's Sleepover Club is fun, with a side of "fuck you."
     Championing lyrics that are equal parts pointed, witty, and
     downright goofy, Sleepover Club provides punk rock ripper after punk
     rock ripper, with each song somehow catchier than the last, on their
     new record, My Other Dad Is Your Ride (released by Youth Riot
     Records).

Mommy Long Legs - "Bridezilla"

     The Seattle band Mommy Long Legs has been around for a bit now,
     amassing a tape, an EP, and a 7″ since they started releasing music
     in 2015. Today, they're announcing their debut album, 'Try Your
     Best,' with a new song called "Bridezilla."
