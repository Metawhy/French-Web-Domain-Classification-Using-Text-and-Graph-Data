   How‚Äôs the weather today? Teach your kindergarten students some basic
   weather small talk! Here are 18 seasons and weather flashcards with
   adjectives and nouns.

   Preschool classes love starting the day with the How‚Äôs the Weather?
   song. Use the weather flashcards in this set while singing It‚Äôs sunny
   today üôÇ

   With older classes of youngsters, match the seasons flashcards with the
   weather cards. You can make longer sentences such as In winter, it‚Äôs
   cold.

Numbers 0-9

   Preview this set

   A simple set of bold numbers 0 ‚Äì 9. Doesn‚Äôt get any simpler than this!
   These numbers are perfect for teaching kindergarten.

Have Fun with Numbers Flashcards

     * Call out ‚Äì Give one number to each student. Have students call out
       their number one at a time, in order.
     * Line up ‚Äì Mix up the number cards. Give one card to each student.
       Ask the students to get into a line, in order. Once they are
       standing in a line, have students call out their number.
     * Don‚Äôt repeat ‚Äì  Teach the students to repeat after you ONLY if the
       number you say matches the card you hold up. Students should NOT
       repeat after you if you call out the wrong number when you show
       them a card.
     * Draw ‚Äì Print out the large set of Numbers Flashcards. Give one card
       to each student. Have each student draw the same number of items as
       the number on the card (ex. On number 3, draw three bears. On
       number 9, draw nine cats). Use the numbers posters to decorate the
       classroom.
