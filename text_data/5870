a rotta love plus :: april rescue of the month

   April 2, 2012

   I’m excited to feature A Rotta Love Plus (ARLP) as our April Rescue of
   the Month! They have a lot of great things happening and a lot of great
   dogs available for adoption. ARLP is a comprehensive and proactive
   all-volunteer advocacy organization that uses a “nose-to-tail” approach
   to address the issues faced by Rottweilers and Pit Bulls. ARLP’s
   strategies include public outreach and awareness to repair the
   reputation of its breeds, community enrichment and education via its
   therapy dog program, spay/neuter initiatives, owner education and
   training, and foster-based dog rescue and rehoming. Their foster and
   adoption program works toward “quality over quantity” by carefully
   selecting the dogs they bring into the program, and the homes in which
   the dogs are fostered and adopted. They provide ongoing assessment and
   support to the program dogs, fosters, and forever homes to ensure their
   ongoing success.

   Since 2005, ARLP has provided unique dog safety and humane education to
   youth, adults, and organizations. It integrates CGC (Canine Good
   Citizen) or therapy-registered dogs in a hands-on learning experience
   that increases knowledge about humane treatment of animals and reduces
   the risk of dog bites. Rott n’ Pit Ed (RPEd) helps build and foster
   strong relationships between dogs and their owners through a balanced
   approach to training. They provide the owners with a variety of tools
   to ensure the right approach is taken for each dog as an individual.
   Dogs need leaders as well as companions, and RPEd gives owners the
   confidence to help their dogs succeed.

   Get Your Fix! provides free spays/neuters, vaccinations and low-cost
   microchips to Pit Bulls and Rottweilers. They go where the community
   needs them the most, to help decrease overpopulation and euthanasia in
   shelters. In 2011, the first year of this program, ARLP spayed/neutered
   64 dogs. In 2012, they expect to spay/neuter more than 300 dogs.

   ARLP’s PRIORITY Paws conducts free dog-therapy groups with youth in
   crisis who reside in local youth-services organizations. Pit bulls and
   Rottweilers provide a tremendous parallel: their stories of abuse,
   neglect, and negative social perception often mirror those of the
   youth, and can inspire them with stories of redemption and resiliency.
   The youth are then enabled to work through their crises using the
   lessons and skills that only the dogs can teach.

   Coming up next week, the 4th Annual Deviant Art Show will take place at
   the Northrup King building in Minneapolis on Saturday April 14, 2012
   from 3-9 pm, with a preview show the evening of Thursday, April 5. It
   was started in 2009 by the lovely Sarah Thornton of Lintu Art to raise
   awareness and funds for ARLP. In addition to experiencing unique,
   multi-media artwork, attendees at this free event can enjoy food and
   beverages, mingle with ARLP volunteers, hang out with registered
   therapy dogs, and learn about and support ARLP. I’ll have a few pieces
   on display, including some favorites from ARLP alum, Ronin’s, Joy
   Session.

   I had three beautiful ladies in the studio yesterday. First up is MJ.
   She’s about 3 years old, plays hard and cuddles harder. She was very
   calm in the studio and I got a couple kisses. She’s really sweet and
   would love a home with other dogs and even cats!

   Tulip is about a year and a half, and was pulled from Minneapolis
   Animal Care and Control. She’s a quick learner, loves car rides and
   other dogs, and cuddling on your head while you lay down.

   Tallulah (or Tally) is a sweet girl who LOVES to chew! She’s from a dog
   fighting bust in Florida, and has a few battle scars to prove it. She
   may be a little pigeon-toed, but she can run/jump/play/crazy with the
   best of them!

       Ahem. I might be just ever so slightly biased, but MJ is the
       awesomest foster dog ever. Just sayin.
     * Rebecca bourdonApril 2, 2012 - 3:32 pm
       Sarah, I love your work and my ARLP alum, Harry, so I would also
       love to hear more about setting up a session! Shoot me an email.
       Thanks!!
     * EmileeApril 3, 2012 - 1:16 pm
       I love MJ! With her pretty face and awesome photos, I’m sure she’ll
       find a home very fast. She looks like such a love!
     * RachelApril 7, 2012 - 5:43 pm
       Oh my Tally is the nesy! Adorable!

meschke :: joy session

   September 3, 2010

   Meschke is so good. His yard isn’t fenced, he doesn’t really need a
   leash, and he stays right by his mom while crossing the street. He’s 10
   years old, and recently had a cancerous tumor removed from his colon.
   While he was under for the surgery, the vet called his mom to see if
   she wanted to let him go right then and there. She couldn’t bear it and
   wanted to give him one more chance. When I met Meschke, I never would
   have guessed I was meeting a 10 year old with very little time left. He
   was happy, vibrant, and so, so friendly.

   It was a hot day, and at first he mostly wanted to lay in the shade,
   but once his mom got out his ball and the chuck-it, he lit up like a
   puppy. If you don’t throw the ball right away, he barks at you until
   you do. I love the look on his face when he’s anticipating the throw,
   geared up for his favorite game ever.

   They don’t know how much time he has, maybe weeks, but he and his mom
   are definitely making the most of it. It was great to meet you,
   Meschke.

   One specific photo they wanted, was the view his mom has while driving
   with Meschke in the back….

       What a sweet baby. I hope that Meschke and his family enjoy the
       time they have with him. I know they’ll treasure these photos and
       black dogs aren’t easy to photograph. Meschke has been very loved
       and many dogs don’t get that. Wishing the family the very best.
     * LeslieSeptember 3, 2010 - 11:19 am
       What wonderful photos. Thank you so much for giving families such
       wonderful memories!! You are an angel!
     * LisaSeptember 3, 2010 - 12:48 pm
       Great photos – they really capture Meschke’s delightful spirit and
       seem to give a glimpse of the love he and his mom share – truly
       heartfelt to see. AND he’s a great roadtripper! How blessed we are
       to have had him join us all!
     * ToddSeptember 4, 2010 - 7:53 am
       Such beautiful photos of a beautiful dog! Our older dog has lived
       11 months since his first cancer diagnosis, so don’t give up hope.
     * ChrisSeptember 17, 2010 - 8:58 am
       Beautiful photographs! Your joy sessions always bring me to tears
       at my computer at work. Tissue please.
