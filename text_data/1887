   Brexit latest: Michel Barnier has told EU27 ambassadors it is
   "difficult" to see a deal emerging in the next ten days unless the
   British ‚Äúfundamentally amend their position‚Äù.
   1.
   Brexit talks are now entering the critical fortnight leading to the
   European council (again).
   Scepticism about a breakthrough is sky high, but the EU is not going to
   flatly reject Boris Johnson's proposals.
   2.
   Barnier has been tasked by member states to find out if the UK gov has
   any room for manoeuvre. This is agenda point number one for talks with
   David Frost on Friday.
   UK flexibility to be tested in coming days, says EU diplomat.
   "This has to happen quickly".

   Remember how these people project everything.
   Top Dems cashed in corruptly with foreign gov't's, raking in hundreds
   of millions, the Clinton's, the Bidens, many others.
   While using foreign intelligence services to illegally spy on the Trump
   campaign.

     https://twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/1179784074526740481

   Literally ***every single thing*** they've spent 3 years accusing Trump
   & his family of doing, the Bidens and the Clintons and the Obamas and
   many other top Democrats and Republicans have been doing for decades.
   And Trump is now at the stage where every single time they try to
   launch another FAKE scandal accusing him or his family of using his
   office to enrich himself, he's going to BOOMERANG IT RIGHT BACK ON THEM
   by pulling the Democrat families REAL corruption into the spotlight.

   I had a fascinating conversation yesterday with a very nice man in his
   70s who gets all of his news from Fox. He wanted me to explain why no
   one is showing the video of Joe Biden bragging that he demanded that
   Ukraine fire the prosecutor for investigating his son.
   I said, "Which tape is that?!" His response was, "That's the problem
   with this country. It's been around for a long time but Fox News is the
   only channel that will show it." I said, "And Biden says he got the
   prosecutor fired for investigating his son? I'd like to see that."
   So we looked for it on my phone and we found it. And we watched it
   together. And Joe Biden says that he got the prosecutor fired because
   he was corrupt. There's no mention of his son, no mention of any
   investigation. And the guy looked at me like he'd just proved something
   to me.

   WARNING: Constitutional theory ahead!
   We always talk about ‚Äúco-equal‚Äù branches of government under the
   Constitution. But in a structural sense, that‚Äôs not actually true.
   Congress has primacy. A thread. 1/
   If you spend time around members of Congress, you‚Äôll inevitably hear
   ‚ÄúCongress is the first branch of government‚Äù and ‚ÄúArticle I is the
   legislative branch.‚Äù
   Both are true, of course, but there‚Äôs often an implication that isn‚Äôt
   true: that because Congress is in Article I, that gives it special
   standing within the separation of powers.

   The stylistic choices in JOKER was good, great even. Costume and set
   design, mainly. Best looking Gotham since RETURNS. Brilliantly shot by
   Lawrence Sher and surprise, Joaquin Phoenix delivered again.
   But in the place where Joker stumbled, it fell hard. Particularly the
   script.
   Script muddled and annoyingly preachy. The message it was trying to
   convey, whether I agree with it or not, was awfully delivered/written.
   It‚Äôs almost like it made fun of itself during the scene where Arthur
   was delivering the bad jokes.
   Todd Phillips flew too close to the sun.
   Turn your brain off, it‚Äôs a boring movie. Turn it on, it‚Äôs a boring
   movie too. Still, go see it. It went to some interesting places.

   Oh, look, it‚Äôs the Brooklyn Heifer Michelle Goldberg, ink shitting more
   nonsense from her lofty, well-gusseted perch at the NYT, former home to
   racist Sarah Jeong. Michelle thinks ‚Äúclown world‚Äù is a recent, secret
   anti-Semitic meme. Good grief, do you get out of Manhattan much?

     https://twitter.com/michelleinbklyn/status/1179094063695499267

   First, let‚Äôs take a look at the bird-cage liner NY Daily News, which
   plastered its front page with @realDonaldTrump as a clown from the get
   go. Was this an anti-Jewish trope, Mega Michelle?
   How about the other times the Daily News portrayed DJT as a clown? Is
   this the original sin source of your clown meme?

   A wealth tax is unconstitutional as it is a tax on property. The moment
   you agree to give the federal government power over your own property
   in principle, we are finished as a nation which values liberty above
   all, and we open the door to inevitable tyranny down the road.

     https://twitter.com/nytopinion/status/1179445964358275072

   There is no liberty without property rights. The federal government
   must never be given any right, not even a minuscule one, to tax your
   property. Once you concede that right in principle, the government can
   take away all of your property down the road, and it inevitably will.
   When Communism comes to America, it will enter as a 'federal wealth
   tax.' Mark my words, and never ever forget them.

   Your reputation and the reputation of your teammates will bring
   candidates to you. Being active and engaged in the design community
   through social media and events (internal or external) helps build that

   The pitch is that EU27 leaders will knife another EU27 leaders to save
   the blushes of an MLA in the only party in NI that wants this deal.
   As noted: notions.

     https://twitter.com/bbcpolitics/status/1179804006605979648

   The fundamental mistake the DUP have taken throughout this is treating
   it like a Stormont negotiation where just saying no means nothing
   happens and HMG and the NIE pick up the pieces for them so it doesn‚Äôt
   go wrong.
   Their approach is predicated on it being the same at EU level.
   It‚Äôs not the same. This is a European negotiation, there are real and
   nasty consequences, the EU always backs members against third countries
   and if you don‚Äôt have prepared alternatives that can persuade the EU,
   you get that which suits the EU to allow you, nothing more.

   Just a little reminder for the democrats on the power of the Presidency
   that they had no problems with undwr Oblahblah.
   Simply put, there is no document held by the United States government
   that the President is restricted from viewing for reasons of national
   security.
   It‚Äôs also impossible for the President to violate a security
   classification; the President has the absolute authority to decide who
   is and is not entitled to know what is in a classified document, and
   may reveal any classified fact he or she deems appropriate to any
   person at any
   time for any reason. Furthermore the President may classify any
   document that he or she sees fit to do so. Don't believe me? Ask the
   media why they haven't told you that Oblahblah classified his phone
   calls too and why they never had a problem with him doing it.

   Something in R not working? Weird error message?
   Go through this list of steps to try to resolve the problem. [thread;
   suggestions & other tips highly welcome]
   @DimperioJane
   1) Did you run a line of code without a ")" at the end?
   Look at your code in the console. Is there a little "+" at the far
   left? R is probably waiting for a complete line of code. Click into the
   console, press ESC, add the ")", and try again
   2) Is R waiting for user input?
   Occasionally R will ask for user input via a pop up Window or within
   the console itself. Look in the console see if you need to give a
   numeric response (option 1, option 2) or look for the GUI's popup.

   All presidents and vice presidents and cabinet members have family and
   friends whose jobs might be impacted by policy. That's why we ask them
   to observe transparent ethics processes and norms. That is what Biden
   did. That is what Trump doesn't do.
   To begin with, we ask that presidents and vice presidents divest from
   personal business holdings. That is what Biden did. That is what Trump
   didn't do.
   Then we ask that presidents and vice presidents disclose tax returns
   and financial records to ensure transparency. That is what Biden did.
   That is what Trump refuses to do.
