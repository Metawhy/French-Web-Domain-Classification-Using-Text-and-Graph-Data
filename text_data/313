Beeswax Privacy Policy

   Updated: May 10, 2019

WHAT IS BEESWAX

   Beeswax is an advertising technology platform headquartered in New York
   City. We are providing this privacy policy to inform you about how our
   technology platform processes information on behalf of online
   advertisers, website owners, data providers and other businesses that
   use our technology and services.

   If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please feel free
   to contact us at privacy@beeswax.com.

   Beeswax runs a technology buying platform for digital media. The
   Beeswax technology allows our customers to buy ad space on websites,
   mobile apps, video players, and other devices. When ad space is bought
   or sold our technology fulfills the transaction by delivering the ad to
   Internet users who visit that site, apps, or device. Generally, an
   Internet user's computer or mobile device comes into contact with
   Beeswax technology when a user views an ad delivered by our technology
   or clicks or taps on the ad to visit the advertiser's website or app.

PRIVACY PRACTICES FOR OUR TECHNOLOGY

   Advertising supports free content and digital user experiences that we
   all love. Our goal is to make advertising more effective by helping to
   display ads that may be of interest to you. We believe that relevant
   ads are more valuable to users than less relevant ads. More relevance
   also helps the services that depend on advertising because advertisers
   pay more for effective ads which in turn leads to higher quality and
   richer consumer experiences.

   Beeswax is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and we
   adhere to the NAI Codes of Conduct. To learn more about the NAI and the
   Code of Conduct please visit:
   http://www.networkadvertising.org/code-enforcement/code.

   Beeswax adheres to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral
   Advertising, the Application of Self-Regulatory Principles to the
   Mobile , and the Application of the Self-Regulatory Principles of
   Transparency and Control to Data Used Across Devices published by the
   Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA). We honor the DAA’s opt-out
   mechanism for data collection and use in connection with mobile
   applications. To learn more about the DAA and your choices, please
   visit www.aboutads.info/choices.

   With regard to the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), Beeswax
   acts as a Data Processor for our customers. Our customers are obligated
   to get proper consent from end consumers in order to use any personal
   data within our system. For example, if a Beeswax customer is using
   cookies collected on the customer's website to retarget users with ads,
   the customer is obligated to have the proper consent for the use of
   that data within Beeswax's system, and to respect opt-outs and the
   other obligations under the GDPR. We process personal data in a number
   of ways, each with respect for lawful consent:
     * Performance of contract. We need to collect and process Personal
       Data in order to deliver our online advertising platform and
       services for our customers.
     * Legitimate business interests. We may use Personal Data for our
       legitimate business interests to administer our platforms, ensure
       the integrity of our transmission network, and to enforce our Terms
       of Service, for example, by analyzing data for signs of fraud.
     * Data Subject Consent. To the extent Customers need to collect and
       share, or allow us to facilitate collection and sharing of Personal
       Data to enable our Services, it is the responsibility of Customers
       to provide necessary privacy notices and obtain required
       consent(s).

WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT, THE PURPOSE OF COLLECTION AND USE

   The Beeswax technology collects information on behalf of its customers
   to help target online advertising to you based on your interests. This
   information may include your IP host address (which we truncate for
   users from the European Economic Area), your browser type (e.g. Chrome
   or Firefox), the date and time of the ad request, pages viewed, your
   operating system (e.g. Macintosh, Windows, Android, OSX), the URL or
   App you are using, and your Internet Service Provider (e.g. Verizon or
   Comcast).

Contact Information

   We collect contact information through our technology from customers,
   vendors and distributors who wish to obtain information or support, or
   to obtain access to our platform. Contact information includes: first
   name, last name, email address, job title, name of the organization,
   country, state/region and phone numbers (cell and/or landline). This
   contact information is used by our sales, support and operations teams
   to contact our customers, vendors and distributors for the purpose of
   providing the requested information or support, and/or providing our
   services. We may collect additional information from individuals
   applying to work at Beeswax, and we may retain that data as long as
   necessary to comply with legal obligations regarding employment. We
   also collect contact information to respond to general inquiries,
   solicit feedback regarding our platform and support, and to communicate
   with you via email regarding our current and future offerings.

Analytics

   Like most organizations, we rely on automatic data collection
   technology (Google Analytics). Google Analytics may collect information
   on our behalf such as your IP host address, Internet service provider,
   browser type, operating system and language, referring and exit pages
   and URLs, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages,
   number of links you click, search terms, and other data. This
   information is collected automatically and anonymized by Google
   Analytics.. For more information on Google Analytics, including how to
   opt out from certain data collection, please visit
   https://www.google.com/analytics.

Mobile Tracking

   To provide relevant ads to users on mobile devices we may also collect
   the following mobile specific information: device type, make and model,
   operating system, mobile advertising identifiers, operating system
   device identifier (For example, IDFA for iOS and Android ID for
   Android) and information about the apps you use. We may also use the
   GPS location of your device if you have opted-in to provide it to one
   of Beeswax's publisher partners as described below under "Location
   Tracking."

   Your iOS mobile device may provide a “Limit Ad Tracking” setting. On
   Android devices, your settings may allow you to “Opt out of
   Interest-Based Ads.” When you have opted out using this setting on a
   device and that information is passed to Beeswax, Beeswax will not use
   your information to target ads to you or place you in segments for
   future marketing.

Cookies

   Cookies are small packets of data that are stored on your computer’s
   hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your
   visits to websites or your viewing of ads. Our cookie policy is
   available at www.beeswax.com/cookies. If you do not want us, or Google
   Analytics to place a cookie on your hard drive, you may be able to turn
   that feature off on your device. Please consult your Internet browser’s
   documentation for information on how to do this, such as by using your
   browser in private mode to block cookies.

Pixel Tags

   We also use pixel tags, which are small, invisible 1x1 images on a web
   page. Pixel tags allow the web page or a third party who serves the
   pixel tag to set, read and modify cookies. Our pixel tag allows Beeswax
   cookies to be set, read, and modified when you visit the websites or
   apps of our partners.

   Please click here if you'd like to opt-out from having Beeswax collect
   your information in connection with our technology.

   When you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer.
   This cookie tells us not to collect your information to tailor our
   online advertising campaigns. Please note that if you block, delete or
   restrict cookies in any way, or if you use a different computer or
   Internet browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.

Location Tracking

   Beeswax may receive latitude and longitude of mobile users from
   publishers or exchanges. We use such data for targeting ads and
   evaluating their success, and may share it with third party companies
   acting as controllers (See, Onward Transfers to Third Parties). This
   information is also maintained in our logs in accordance with our data
   retention policy (below). In the European Union, when we receive
   precise location information we truncate the location data to three
   decimal places to be less precise before storing such data.

Information We Receive from Third Parties

   We may also receive information about you from third parties when you
   use our services on such third party sites. We may combine the
   information we receive from these third parties with the information we
   directly collect from you and use such information in accordance with
   this Privacy Policy and requirements under applicable EU data
   protection and privacy laws.

Use of Cross-Device Linking

   Beeswax may offer cross-device linking services to our customers. These
   services attempt to identify which anonymous identifiers are associated
   with the same user across devices, such as between a desktop computer
   and a mobile device. To enable these services, we may, subject to the
   section on Onward Transfer to Third Parties, share your information
   with contracted third parties that provide cross-device linking
   services. For consumers who have opted-out from the use of your
   personal information by Beeswax, we do not share any of your
   information with these third parties and do not attempt to re-identify
   the user in any way. We do not utilize cross-device linking services
   when we know the user or the ad request is subject to GDPR. To
   effectively opt-out of our cross-device linking services, users must
   opt-out on every device and browser using our opt-out methods described
   below and in the section on Mobile Tracking.

ONWARD TRANSFER TO THIRD PARTIES

   Beeswax may share your information with its customers in connection
   with the offering of its services. For example, a Beeswax customer may
   receive a log of all ads they served through our platform, including
   anonymous cookie IDs, IP host addresses, and other information in
   non-aggregated form. For users within the European Union, any personal
   data is pseudonymized (one-way hashed) before being shared with
   customers and are sufficiently protected as required by Privacy Shield
   participants (see below for more information about how we handle the
   transfer of data outside the EEA).

   Like many businesses, we hire other companies to perform certain
   business-related services. We may disclose personal information to
   certain types of third party companies but only to the extent needed to
   enable them to provide such services. The types of companies that may
   receive personal information and their functions are: data analytics
   vendors, data hosting providers, optimization vendors, email delivery
   providers, customer relationship managers, and marketing services
   companies. All such third parties function as our agents, performing
   services at our instruction and on our behalf pursuant to contracts
   which require they provide at least the same level of privacy
   protection as is required by this privacy policy and implemented by
   Beeswax. You may opt out of having your personal information
   transferred to any or all of our categories of agents by contacting us
   at privacy@beeswax.com. Please allow us a reasonable time to process
   your request.

   Business Transfers. In the event of a merger, dissolution or similar
   corporate event, or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets,
   we expect that the information that we have collected, would be
   transferred to the surviving entity in a merger or the acquiring
   entity. All such transfers shall be subject to our commitments with
   respect to the privacy and confidentiality of such information as set
   forth in this privacy policy.

   Disclosure to Public Authorities. We are required to disclose the
   information that we have collected in response to lawful requests by
   public authorities, including for the purpose of meeting national
   security or law enforcement requirements. We may also disclose personal
   information to other third parties when compelled to do so by
   government authorities or required by law or regulation including, but
   not limited to, in response to court orders and subpoenas.

OPT-OUT FOR DIRECT MARKETING

   You may opt out at any time from the use of your personal information
   for direct marketing purposes by clicking here or by contacting us at
   privacy@beeswax.com. Please allow us a reasonable time to process your
   request.

DATA TRANSPARENCY

   You may review the information Beeswax's customers store with us about
   you by visiting our data transparency page here.

ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION

   Upon request to privacy@beeswax.com, we will provide you with
   confirmation as to whether we are processing your personal information,
   and have the data communicated to you within a reasonable time. As a
   data processor, we do not directly control any personal data, so any
   changes or inaccuracies in the data we collect should be addressed to
   the controllers of such data. Please allow us a reasonable time to
   respond to your inquiries and requests.

HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION

   Beeswax takes very seriously the security and privacy of the personal
   information that it collects pursuant to this privacy policy.
   Accordingly, we will implement reasonable and appropriate security
   measures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse and
   unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking
   into account the risks involved in processing and the nature of such
   data, and comply with applicable laws and regulations.

CHILDREN

   We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children
   under the age of thirteen through the platform. If you are under 13,
   please do not give us any personal information. We encourage parents
   and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to
   help enforce our privacy policy by instructing their children never to
   provide personal information to us without their permission. If you
   have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided
   personal information to us, please contact us at privacy@beeswax.com,
   and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.

LINKS TO EXTERNAL WEBSITES

   The Beeswax technology may contain links to third party websites
   (“External Sites”). Beeswax has no control over the privacy practices
   of these External Sites. As such, we are not responsible for the
   privacy policies of those External Sites. You should check the
   applicable third party privacy policy and terms of use when visiting
   any External Sites, and before providing any personal information to
   such External Sites.

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO ALL NON-US RESIDENTS

   Our servers are located in the US. If you are located outside of the
   US, please be aware that any information provided to us, including
   personal information, will be transferred from your country of origin
   to the US. Except in the case of data transfers under the EU-US Privacy
   Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, your
   decision to provide such data to us, or allow us to collect such data
   it through our technology, constitutes your consent to this data
   transfer.

IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR RESIDENTS OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA AND SWITZERLAND

   Beeswax complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the
   Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department
   of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal
   information from the European Union member countries (including
   Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) and Switzerland to the United
   States, respectively. Beeswax has certified that it adheres to the
   Privacy Shield principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward
   Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access,
   Recourse, Enforcement and Liability (the “Privacy Shield Principles”).
   With regard to the Principle of Accountability for Onward Transfer, for
   example, we remain liable if our agent processes such personal
   information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield
   Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event
   giving rise to the damage. If there is a conflict between this privacy
   policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles
   shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to
   view our certification page, please visit
   https://www.privacyshield.gov/.

   Beeswax is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the
   Federal Trade Commission.

   In compliance with the EU-US and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield
   Principles, Beeswax commits to resolve complaints about your privacy
   and our collection or use of your personal information. European Union
   or Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this
   privacy policy should first contact Beeswax at privacy@beeswax.com.
   Beeswax has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints
   under the EU-US and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles to BBB EU
   PRIVACY SHIELD, a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider
   located in the United States and operated by the Council of Better
   Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your
   complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by
   Beeswax, please visit www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/
   for more information and to file a complaint. If these processes do not
   result in a resolution, you may also contact your local data protection
   authority, the US Department of Commerce, and/or the Federal Trade
   Commission for assistance. If your complaint still remains unresolved,
   then you have the right to invoke binding arbitration by the Privacy
   Shield Panel upon written notice to Beeswax at privacy@beeswax.com.

CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

   Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of
   California have the right to obtain certain information about the types
   of personal information that companies with whom they have an
   established business relationship (and that are not otherwise exempt)
   have shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes during the
   preceding calendar year, including the names and addresses of those
   third parties, and examples of the types of services or products
   marketed by those third parties. If you wish to submit a request
   pursuant to Section 1798.83, please contact Beeswax via email at
   privacy@beeswax.com. Beeswax does not monitor, recognize or honor any
   opt-out or do not track mechanisms including general web browser, “Do
   Not Track” settings and/or signals.

DATA RETENTION

   We retain the information that is reasonably linkable to a device and
   collected for ad targeting and/or ad delivery and reporting only as
   long as is legitimately necessary for running advertising campaigns and
   in no event longer than thirteen (13) months. We keep opt-out
   information for longer than this period so that we can continue to
   honor opt-out requests. Aggregated data, such as the results of
   campaigns or the amount spent on different inventory sources, may be
   retained indefinitely provided that the data is not reasonably linkable
   to a device. Our cookie's duration on your browser may exceed 13
   months, but no data associated with that cookie will do so.

CHANGES TO OUR POLICY

   We may revise this policy at any time. Any changes and/or updates to
   the policy will be updated directly on this page. We encourage you to
   visit this page periodically to review our privacy policy so that you
   will always know what information we gather and how we may use that
   information.

Empowering Sophisticated Programmatic Strategies

   [b085b7d57b8acff63e1c5be5165a6211.png]

   “We’ve shown that consumers that engage with a playable ad have a
   whopping 95% brand message recall. It’s hard to beat that in the mobile
   environment. Beeswax’s system is optimized for mobile. None of the
   other DSPs work as seamlessly in a fast-changing environment.”
   Rob Grossberg, CEO

   [9cd9f1af007e99537f38a7b3a919ab4e.png]

   “Beeswax gave us the power and control we felt was lacking from other
   solutions in the marketplace. Specifically, Beeswax allowed us to
   customize an in-house solution empowered by our proprietary analytics
   and technology capabilities. We were able to meet our campaign
   objectives while also having full transparency of our costs, results,
   and underlying data. The process was easy, and the results were
   tremendous.”

   “From the very beginning, Beeswax has gone well beyond the call to make
   sure we were getting what we need throughout the development and
   testing process. As we add to our roadmap, Beeswax gives us the support
   to get the tech right and ensure we will continually be successful and
   consistently meet our goals. Previously, we were at the mercy of the
   very high-level, non-strategic data most DSPs deliver to their clients.
   But with Beeswax, we have the insights that drive our business.”

   “This integration enables sales teams to automate the booking of media
   buys and execution of orders across owned and acquired inventory. With
   this partnership we can showcase the business value of increased
   efficiencies and reduced complexity across the ever-expanding number of
   execution channels that Media Companies operate in.”

   “One of the primary reasons iotec decided to work with Beeswax is
   because of its ability to help us focus and develop one of our core
   unique selling points -- the machine learning technology. The quality
   of integrations Beeswax has in place, their easy-to-use UI, and the
   infrastructure cost savings were other key determining factors. We are
   continually impressed by the Beeswax platform and its technical support
   team.”

   “Due to the nature of the Beeswax platform, we didn't have to worry
   about the tech behind the DSP. Rather, Beeswax gave us the flexibility
   to focus our efforts where we know we bring value to the online
   advertising ecosystem: data processing and bidding intelligence.”

Beeswax Privacy Policy

   Updated: May 10, 2019

WHAT IS BEESWAX

   Beeswax is an advertising technology platform headquartered in New York
   City. We are providing this privacy policy to inform you about how our
   technology platform processes information on behalf of online
   advertisers, website owners, data providers and other businesses that
   use our technology and services.

   If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please feel free
   to contact us at privacy@beeswax.com.

   Beeswax runs a technology buying platform for digital media. The
   Beeswax technology allows our customers to buy ad space on websites,
   mobile apps, video players, and other devices. When ad space is bought
   or sold our technology fulfills the transaction by delivering the ad to
   Internet users who visit that site, apps, or device. Generally, an
   Internet user's computer or mobile device comes into contact with
   Beeswax technology when a user views an ad delivered by our technology
   or clicks or taps on the ad to visit the advertiser's website or app.

PRIVACY PRACTICES FOR OUR TECHNOLOGY

   Advertising supports free content and digital user experiences that we
   all love. Our goal is to make advertising more effective by helping to
   display ads that may be of interest to you. We believe that relevant
   ads are more valuable to users than less relevant ads. More relevance
   also helps the services that depend on advertising because advertisers
   pay more for effective ads which in turn leads to higher quality and
   richer consumer experiences.

   Beeswax is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and we
   adhere to the NAI Codes of Conduct. To learn more about the NAI and the
   Code of Conduct please visit:
   http://www.networkadvertising.org/code-enforcement/code.

   Beeswax adheres to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral
   Advertising, the Application of Self-Regulatory Principles to the
   Mobile , and the Application of the Self-Regulatory Principles of
   Transparency and Control to Data Used Across Devices published by the
   Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA). We honor the DAA’s opt-out
   mechanism for data collection and use in connection with mobile
   applications. To learn more about the DAA and your choices, please
   visit www.aboutads.info/choices.

   With regard to the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), Beeswax
   acts as a Data Processor for our customers. Our customers are obligated
   to get proper consent from end consumers in order to use any personal
   data within our system. For example, if a Beeswax customer is using
   cookies collected on the customer's website to retarget users with ads,
   the customer is obligated to have the proper consent for the use of
   that data within Beeswax's system, and to respect opt-outs and the
   other obligations under the GDPR. We process personal data in a number
   of ways, each with respect for lawful consent:
     * Performance of contract. We need to collect and process Personal
       Data in order to deliver our online advertising platform and
       services for our customers.
     * Legitimate business interests. We may use Personal Data for our
       legitimate business interests to administer our platforms, ensure
       the integrity of our transmission network, and to enforce our Terms
       of Service, for example, by analyzing data for signs of fraud.
     * Data Subject Consent. To the extent Customers need to collect and
       share, or allow us to facilitate collection and sharing of Personal
       Data to enable our Services, it is the responsibility of Customers
       to provide necessary privacy notices and obtain required
       consent(s).

WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT, THE PURPOSE OF COLLECTION AND USE

   The Beeswax technology collects information on behalf of its customers
   to help target online advertising to you based on your interests. This
   information may include your IP host address (which we truncate for
   users from the European Economic Area), your browser type (e.g. Chrome
   or Firefox), the date and time of the ad request, pages viewed, your
   operating system (e.g. Macintosh, Windows, Android, OSX), the URL or
   App you are using, and your Internet Service Provider (e.g. Verizon or
   Comcast).

Contact Information

   We collect contact information through our technology from customers,
   vendors and distributors who wish to obtain information or support, or
   to obtain access to our platform. Contact information includes: first
   name, last name, email address, job title, name of the organization,
   country, state/region and phone numbers (cell and/or landline). This
   contact information is used by our sales, support and operations teams
   to contact our customers, vendors and distributors for the purpose of
   providing the requested information or support, and/or providing our
   services. We may collect additional information from individuals
   applying to work at Beeswax, and we may retain that data as long as
   necessary to comply with legal obligations regarding employment. We
   also collect contact information to respond to general inquiries,
   solicit feedback regarding our platform and support, and to communicate
   with you via email regarding our current and future offerings.

Analytics

   Like most organizations, we rely on automatic data collection
   technology (Google Analytics). Google Analytics may collect information
   on our behalf such as your IP host address, Internet service provider,
   browser type, operating system and language, referring and exit pages
   and URLs, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages,
   number of links you click, search terms, and other data. This
   information is collected automatically and anonymized by Google
   Analytics.. For more information on Google Analytics, including how to
   opt out from certain data collection, please visit
   https://www.google.com/analytics.

Mobile Tracking

   To provide relevant ads to users on mobile devices we may also collect
   the following mobile specific information: device type, make and model,
   operating system, mobile advertising identifiers, operating system
   device identifier (For example, IDFA for iOS and Android ID for
   Android) and information about the apps you use. We may also use the
   GPS location of your device if you have opted-in to provide it to one
   of Beeswax's publisher partners as described below under "Location
   Tracking."

   Your iOS mobile device may provide a “Limit Ad Tracking” setting. On
   Android devices, your settings may allow you to “Opt out of
   Interest-Based Ads.” When you have opted out using this setting on a
   device and that information is passed to Beeswax, Beeswax will not use
   your information to target ads to you or place you in segments for
   future marketing.

Cookies

   Cookies are small packets of data that are stored on your computer’s
   hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your
   visits to websites or your viewing of ads. Our cookie policy is
   available at www.beeswax.com/cookies. If you do not want us, or Google
   Analytics to place a cookie on your hard drive, you may be able to turn
   that feature off on your device. Please consult your Internet browser’s
   documentation for information on how to do this, such as by using your
   browser in private mode to block cookies.

Pixel Tags

   We also use pixel tags, which are small, invisible 1x1 images on a web
   page. Pixel tags allow the web page or a third party who serves the
   pixel tag to set, read and modify cookies. Our pixel tag allows Beeswax
   cookies to be set, read, and modified when you visit the websites or
   apps of our partners.

   Please click here if you'd like to opt-out from having Beeswax collect
   your information in connection with our technology.

   When you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer.
   This cookie tells us not to collect your information to tailor our
   online advertising campaigns. Please note that if you block, delete or
   restrict cookies in any way, or if you use a different computer or
   Internet browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.

Location Tracking

   Beeswax may receive latitude and longitude of mobile users from
   publishers or exchanges. We use such data for targeting ads and
   evaluating their success, and may share it with third party companies
   acting as controllers (See, Onward Transfers to Third Parties). This
   information is also maintained in our logs in accordance with our data
   retention policy (below). In the European Union, when we receive
   precise location information we truncate the location data to three
   decimal places to be less precise before storing such data.

Information We Receive from Third Parties

   We may also receive information about you from third parties when you
   use our services on such third party sites. We may combine the
   information we receive from these third parties with the information we
   directly collect from you and use such information in accordance with
   this Privacy Policy and requirements under applicable EU data
   protection and privacy laws.

Use of Cross-Device Linking

   Beeswax may offer cross-device linking services to our customers. These
   services attempt to identify which anonymous identifiers are associated
   with the same user across devices, such as between a desktop computer
   and a mobile device. To enable these services, we may, subject to the
   section on Onward Transfer to Third Parties, share your information
   with contracted third parties that provide cross-device linking
   services. For consumers who have opted-out from the use of your
   personal information by Beeswax, we do not share any of your
   information with these third parties and do not attempt to re-identify
   the user in any way. We do not utilize cross-device linking services
   when we know the user or the ad request is subject to GDPR. To
   effectively opt-out of our cross-device linking services, users must
   opt-out on every device and browser using our opt-out methods described
   below and in the section on Mobile Tracking.

ONWARD TRANSFER TO THIRD PARTIES

   Beeswax may share your information with its customers in connection
   with the offering of its services. For example, a Beeswax customer may
   receive a log of all ads they served through our platform, including
   anonymous cookie IDs, IP host addresses, and other information in
   non-aggregated form. For users within the European Union, any personal
   data is pseudonymized (one-way hashed) before being shared with
   customers and are sufficiently protected as required by Privacy Shield
   participants (see below for more information about how we handle the
   transfer of data outside the EEA).

   Like many businesses, we hire other companies to perform certain
   business-related services. We may disclose personal information to
   certain types of third party companies but only to the extent needed to
   enable them to provide such services. The types of companies that may
   receive personal information and their functions are: data analytics
   vendors, data hosting providers, optimization vendors, email delivery
   providers, customer relationship managers, and marketing services
   companies. All such third parties function as our agents, performing
   services at our instruction and on our behalf pursuant to contracts
   which require they provide at least the same level of privacy
   protection as is required by this privacy policy and implemented by
   Beeswax. You may opt out of having your personal information
   transferred to any or all of our categories of agents by contacting us
   at privacy@beeswax.com. Please allow us a reasonable time to process
   your request.

   Business Transfers. In the event of a merger, dissolution or similar
   corporate event, or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets,
   we expect that the information that we have collected, would be
   transferred to the surviving entity in a merger or the acquiring
   entity. All such transfers shall be subject to our commitments with
   respect to the privacy and confidentiality of such information as set
   forth in this privacy policy.

   Disclosure to Public Authorities. We are required to disclose the
   information that we have collected in response to lawful requests by
   public authorities, including for the purpose of meeting national
   security or law enforcement requirements. We may also disclose personal
   information to other third parties when compelled to do so by
   government authorities or required by law or regulation including, but
   not limited to, in response to court orders and subpoenas.

OPT-OUT FOR DIRECT MARKETING

   You may opt out at any time from the use of your personal information
   for direct marketing purposes by clicking here or by contacting us at
   privacy@beeswax.com. Please allow us a reasonable time to process your
   request.

DATA TRANSPARENCY

   You may review the information Beeswax's customers store with us about
   you by visiting our data transparency page here.

ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION

   Upon request to privacy@beeswax.com, we will provide you with
   confirmation as to whether we are processing your personal information,
   and have the data communicated to you within a reasonable time. As a
   data processor, we do not directly control any personal data, so any
   changes or inaccuracies in the data we collect should be addressed to
   the controllers of such data. Please allow us a reasonable time to
   respond to your inquiries and requests.

HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION

   Beeswax takes very seriously the security and privacy of the personal
   information that it collects pursuant to this privacy policy.
   Accordingly, we will implement reasonable and appropriate security
   measures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse and
   unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking
   into account the risks involved in processing and the nature of such
   data, and comply with applicable laws and regulations.

CHILDREN

   We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children
   under the age of thirteen through the platform. If you are under 13,
   please do not give us any personal information. We encourage parents
   and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to
   help enforce our privacy policy by instructing their children never to
   provide personal information to us without their permission. If you
   have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided
   personal information to us, please contact us at privacy@beeswax.com,
   and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.

LINKS TO EXTERNAL WEBSITES

   The Beeswax technology may contain links to third party websites
   (“External Sites”). Beeswax has no control over the privacy practices
   of these External Sites. As such, we are not responsible for the
   privacy policies of those External Sites. You should check the
   applicable third party privacy policy and terms of use when visiting
   any External Sites, and before providing any personal information to
   such External Sites.

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO ALL NON-US RESIDENTS

   Our servers are located in the US. If you are located outside of the
   US, please be aware that any information provided to us, including
   personal information, will be transferred from your country of origin
   to the US. Except in the case of data transfers under the EU-US Privacy
   Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, your
   decision to provide such data to us, or allow us to collect such data
   it through our technology, constitutes your consent to this data
   transfer.

IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR RESIDENTS OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA AND SWITZERLAND

   Beeswax complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the
   Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department
   of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal
   information from the European Union member countries (including
   Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) and Switzerland to the United
   States, respectively. Beeswax has certified that it adheres to the
   Privacy Shield principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward
   Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access,
   Recourse, Enforcement and Liability (the “Privacy Shield Principles”).
   With regard to the Principle of Accountability for Onward Transfer, for
   example, we remain liable if our agent processes such personal
   information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield
   Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event
   giving rise to the damage. If there is a conflict between this privacy
   policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles
   shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to
   view our certification page, please visit
   https://www.privacyshield.gov/.

   Beeswax is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the
   Federal Trade Commission.

   In compliance with the EU-US and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield
   Principles, Beeswax commits to resolve complaints about your privacy
   and our collection or use of your personal information. European Union
   or Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this
   privacy policy should first contact Beeswax at privacy@beeswax.com.
   Beeswax has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints
   under the EU-US and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles to BBB EU
   PRIVACY SHIELD, a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider
   located in the United States and operated by the Council of Better
   Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your
   complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by
   Beeswax, please visit www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/
   for more information and to file a complaint. If these processes do not
   result in a resolution, you may also contact your local data protection
   authority, the US Department of Commerce, and/or the Federal Trade
   Commission for assistance. If your complaint still remains unresolved,
   then you have the right to invoke binding arbitration by the Privacy
   Shield Panel upon written notice to Beeswax at privacy@beeswax.com.

CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

   Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of
   California have the right to obtain certain information about the types
   of personal information that companies with whom they have an
   established business relationship (and that are not otherwise exempt)
   have shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes during the
   preceding calendar year, including the names and addresses of those
   third parties, and examples of the types of services or products
   marketed by those third parties. If you wish to submit a request
   pursuant to Section 1798.83, please contact Beeswax via email at
   privacy@beeswax.com. Beeswax does not monitor, recognize or honor any
   opt-out or do not track mechanisms including general web browser, “Do
   Not Track” settings and/or signals.

DATA RETENTION

   We retain the information that is reasonably linkable to a device and
   collected for ad targeting and/or ad delivery and reporting only as
   long as is legitimately necessary for running advertising campaigns and
   in no event longer than thirteen (13) months. We keep opt-out
   information for longer than this period so that we can continue to
   honor opt-out requests. Aggregated data, such as the results of
   campaigns or the amount spent on different inventory sources, may be
   retained indefinitely provided that the data is not reasonably linkable
   to a device. Our cookie's duration on your browser may exceed 13
   months, but no data associated with that cookie will do so.

CHANGES TO OUR POLICY

   We may revise this policy at any time. Any changes and/or updates to
   the policy will be updated directly on this page. We encourage you to
   visit this page periodically to review our privacy policy so that you
   will always know what information we gather and how we may use that
   information.

Empowering Sophisticated Programmatic Strategies

   “We’ve shown that consumers that engage with a playable ad have a
   whopping 95% brand message recall. It’s hard to beat that in the mobile
   environment. Beeswax’s system is optimized for mobile. None of the
   other DSPs work as seamlessly in a fast-changing environment.”

   [9cd9f1af007e99537f38a7b3a919ab4e.png]

   “Beeswax gave us the power and control we felt was lacking from other
   solutions in the marketplace. Specifically, Beeswax allowed us to
   customize an in-house solution empowered by our proprietary analytics
   and technology capabilities. We were able to meet our campaign
   objectives while also having full transparency of our costs, results,
   and underlying data. The process was easy, and the results were
   tremendous.”

   “From the very beginning, Beeswax has gone well beyond the call to make
   sure we were getting what we need throughout the development and
   testing process. As we add to our roadmap, Beeswax gives us the support
   to get the tech right and ensure we will continually be successful and
   consistently meet our goals. Previously, we were at the mercy of the
   very high-level, non-strategic data most DSPs deliver to their clients.
   But with Beeswax, we have the insights that drive our business.”

   “This integration enables sales teams to automate the booking of media
   buys and execution of orders across owned and acquired inventory. With
   this partnership we can showcase the business value of increased
   efficiencies and reduced complexity across the ever-expanding number of
   execution channels that Media Companies operate in.”

   “One of the primary reasons iotec decided to work with Beeswax is
   because of its ability to help us focus and develop one of our core
   unique selling points -- the machine learning technology. The quality
   of integrations Beeswax has in place, their easy-to-use UI, and the
   infrastructure cost savings were other key determining factors. We are
   continually impressed by the Beeswax platform and its technical support
   team.”

   “Due to the nature of the Beeswax platform, we didn't have to worry
   about the tech behind the DSP. Rather, Beeswax gave us the flexibility
   to focus our efforts where we know we bring value to the online
   advertising ecosystem: data processing and bidding intelligence.”

Empowering Sophisticated Programmatic Strategies

   “We’ve shown that consumers that engage with a playable ad have a
   whopping 95% brand message recall. It’s hard to beat that in the mobile
   environment. Beeswax’s system is optimized for mobile. None of the
   other DSPs work as seamlessly in a fast-changing environment.”

   “Beeswax gave us the power and control we felt was lacking from other
   solutions in the marketplace. Specifically, Beeswax allowed us to
   customize an in-house solution empowered by our proprietary analytics
   and technology capabilities. We were able to meet our campaign
   objectives while also having full transparency of our costs, results,
   and underlying data. The process was easy, and the results were
   tremendous.”

   “From the very beginning, Beeswax has gone well beyond the call to make
   sure we were getting what we need throughout the development and
   testing process. As we add to our roadmap, Beeswax gives us the support
   to get the tech right and ensure we will continually be successful and
   consistently meet our goals. Previously, we were at the mercy of the
   very high-level, non-strategic data most DSPs deliver to their clients.
   But with Beeswax, we have the insights that drive our business.”

   “This integration enables sales teams to automate the booking of media
   buys and execution of orders across owned and acquired inventory. With
   this partnership we can showcase the business value of increased
   efficiencies and reduced complexity across the ever-expanding number of
   execution channels that Media Companies operate in.”

   “One of the primary reasons iotec decided to work with Beeswax is
   because of its ability to help us focus and develop one of our core
   unique selling points -- the machine learning technology. The quality
   of integrations Beeswax has in place, their easy-to-use UI, and the
   infrastructure cost savings were other key determining factors. We are
   continually impressed by the Beeswax platform and its technical support
   team.”

   “Due to the nature of the Beeswax platform, we didn't have to worry
   about the tech behind the DSP. Rather, Beeswax gave us the flexibility
   to focus our efforts where we know we bring value to the online
   advertising ecosystem: data processing and bidding intelligence.”
