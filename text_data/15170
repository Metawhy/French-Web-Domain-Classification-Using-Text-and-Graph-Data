   The Human Capital Index (HCI) database provides data at the country
   level for each of the components of the Human Capital Index as well as
   for the overall index, disaggregated by gender. The index measures the
   amount of human capital that a child born today can expect to attain by
   age 18, given the risks of poor health and poor education that prevail
   in the country where she lives. It is designed to highlight how
   improvements in current health and education outcomes shape the
   productivity of the next generation of workers, assuming that children
   born today experience over the next 18 years the educational
   opportunities and health risks that children in this age range
   currently face.

Human Capital Index

     * HCI and GDP Per Capita PPP (log scale, horizontal axis)
       Productivity relative to benchmark of complete education and full

       Greece
       [placeholder.png]

   The Human Capital Index (HCI) database provides data at the country
   level for each of the components of the Human Capital Index as well as
   for the overall index, disaggregated by gender. The index measures the
   amount of human capital that a child born today can expect to attain by
   age 18, given the risks of poor health and poor education that prevail
   in the country where she lives. It is designed to highlight how
   improvements in current health and education outcomes shape the
   productivity of the next generation of workers, assuming that children
   born today experience over the next 18 years the educational
   opportunities and health risks that children in this age range
   currently face.

   The Human Capital Index (HCI) database provides data at the country

   amount of human capital that a child born today can expect to attain by
   age 18, given the risks of poor health and poor education that prevail
   in the country where she lives. It is designed to highlight how
   improvements in current health and education outcomes shape the
   productivity of the next generation of workers, assuming that children
   born today experience over the next 18 years the educational
   opportunities and health risks that children in this age range
   currently face.

   The Human Capital Index (HCI) database provides data at the country
   level for each of the components of the Human Capital Index as well as
   for the overall index, disaggregated by gender. The index measures the
   amount of human capital that a child born today can expect to attain by
   age 18, given the risks of poor health and poor education that prevail
   in the country where she lives. It is designed to highlight how
   improvements in current health and education outcomes shape the
   productivity of the next generation of workers, assuming that children
   born today experience over the next 18 years the educational
   opportunities and health risks that children in this age range
   currently face.

Human Capital Index

     * HCI and GDP Per Capita PPP (log scale, horizontal axis)
       Productivity relative to benchmark of complete education and full
       health
       Saudi Arabia
       [placeholder.png]

   The Human Capital Index (HCI) database provides data at the country
   level for each of the components of the Human Capital Index as well as
   for the overall index, disaggregated by gender. The index measures the
   amount of human capital that a child born today can expect to attain by
   age 18, given the risks of poor health and poor education that prevail
   in the country where she lives. It is designed to highlight how
   improvements in current health and education outcomes shape the
   productivity of the next generation of workers, assuming that children
   born today experience over the next 18 years the educational
   opportunities and health risks that children in this age range
   currently face.
