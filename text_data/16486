Sponsors

   Event Sponsorship and In-Cooperation

   There are three ways in which SIGAPP can be involved with a technical
   meeting: as a “full sponsored”, “co sponsored” or as "in cooperation".
   From an applicant's perspective, the difference between applying for
   sponsorship/co-sponsorship and in-cooperation status is that the latter
   is far simpler to obtain because it does not entail any financial
   involvement or liability by SIGAPP.
   Proceedings will be copyrighted by ACM and be in the Digital Library,
   unless specific agreements are in place with other co-sponsors.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Requesting Event Sponsorship or In-Cooperation with ACM/SIGAPP

   ACM provides some guidelines and an online form (the TMRF) to request
   in-cooperation status. Below we provide a list of additional
   requirements that must be met by a conference seeking in-cooperation
   status, followed by a set of guidelines that will increase the chances
   that the SIGAPP Executive Committee will approve a request.
   Note that you may not use the ACM or SIGAPP names or logos on materials
   promoting the conference (websites, CFPs, etc.) prior to approval of
   the TMRF.

   The non-negotiable requirements are:
     * The meeting shall not be run by a for-profit organization (except
       in rare exceptions authorized by the SIG Governing Board Executive
       Committee and the SIGAPP Executive Committee)
     * Registration discount for SIGAPP members and ACM members must be
       equivalent to the 'member' discount offered, if any
     * Attendance policies of the meeting (e.g. open, invitation-only,
       etc.) must be specified.
     * A formal request (TMRF) must be made for every instance of a
       recurring event (i.e. approval for a given conference applies only
       to the single occurrence of the conference for which the TMRF was
       submitted.)
     * As required by the ACM, meeting organizers must provide, within
       three months of the event, a short report to the SIGAPP Executive
       Committee summarizing the event. The report should cover the number
       of papers submitted, the number of papers accepted, the number of
       attendees, and an outline of the conference budget. It should also
       contain a brief assessment of the success of the event.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Holding an Event co-sponsored by ACM/SIGAPP

   A co-sponsored event is an event sponsored by another organization that
   wishes to have a formal connection with ACM/SIGAPP and its members.
   This arrangement implies no financial involvement from SIGAPP, and it
   is straightforward to obtain, provided that
     * ACM will assist the event organizers with overall conference
       arrangements and budget planning
     * ACM will assist the event organizers with hotel selection and
       contract negotiations
     * ACM will support financial transactions for the event with an
       option to coordinate registrations on-line with the conference
       accounts
     * The proceedings will be published in the ACM Digital Library
     * The announcement of the conference will be posted on the SIGAPP web
       site
     * The ACM and SIGAPP logos and name can be used on any publicity
       about the conference
     * The conference will be listed in the ACM calendar
     * Events sponsored by ACM/SIGAPP

     * SAC (Symposium on Applied Computing)
     * RACS (Research in Adaptive and Convergent Systems)
     __________________________________________________________________

   Holding an Event In-Cooperation with ACM/SIGAPP

   An In-cooperation conference is an event sponsored by another
   organization that wishes to have a formal connection with ACM/SIGAPP
   and its members. The requirements for SIGAPP in-cooperation status
   include the following:
     * The meeting cannot be sponsored by a for-profit organization;
       however, some forms of corporate funding are allowed. SIGAPP will
       not be financially responsible for the meeting.
     * In-cooperation events must have at least 5 SIGAPP members among
       Organizing Committee or Steering Committee members.
     * In-cooperation events must have an open call for participation and
       a clearly documented evaluation and review process.
     * In-cooperation events are encouraged to follow SIGAPP policies and
       procedures, and have to include in their website and call for
       papers a mandatory Anti-Harassment Policy.
     * In-cooperation events must have a special registration fee discount
       program for SIGAPP and ACM members. Registration costs should be
       reasonable; if there is a reduced registration rate, then SIGAPP
       members should be eligible for it.
     * A table is provided in the registration area for a display of ACM
       and SIGAPP membership and publication literature if needed.
     * In-cooperated conferences must include a link for SIGAPP
       registration on the webpage and registration form. Organizers can
       contact the ACM Headquarters (incoop@acm.org), to have SIGAPP
       membership materials sent directly to the conference location for
       display there.
     * Proof of liability insurance is provided by all sponsoring
       organizations.

SAC Meetings

   Over the past years, the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC), the
   primary SIGAPP Annual Conference, has become a primary forum for
   applied computer scientists, computer engineers, software engineers,
   and application developers from around the world to interact and
   present their work. Each year the event is organized as a number of
   specialist tracks on various areas of computer applications. The Tracks
   define the conference theme each year.

RACS

   RACS provides an excellent forum for addressing research issues of
   concern within the adaptive and convergent computing area. Adaptive and
   convergent computing concentrates on innovative solutions to complex
   problems in all areas of industry and sciences using adaptive and
   convergent techniques in computer science and engineering. It involves
   programming, software engineering, graphics, databases, wireless
   networks, security, distributed systems, operating systems and so on.

About the Applied Computing Review

   Applied Computing Review is distributed to all ACM/SIGAPP members as
   benefit of membership, and is available to non-SIGAPP members,
   libraries and other institutions by special subscription. Please direct
   subscription inquiries to Applied Computing Review, Association for
   Computing Machinery, 2 Penn Plaza, Suite 701, New York, NY 10121-0701.

Information for Authors

   All ACR articles are externally, multiply and blindly reviewed for
   originality, importance, correctness, coherence, effectiveness and
   timeliness. Original articles relating to innovative and novel
   applications of, or experimentation with, computing technology or the
   production of new computing artifacts are encouraged. This includes
   general interest articles, surveys, case studies, and research
   monographs so long as they are oriented toward current or future
   computing applications. Normally, ACR will not publish reports,
   commentaries or correspondence. ACR will not consider articles which
   have appeared in, or are under consideration by, other publication
   Authors of accepted articles will be required to produce final version
   in camera-ready form. Although not required, authors are encouraged to
   submit articles in camera-ready form as well in order to determine any
   layout incompatibilities as early as possible in the production cycle.<
