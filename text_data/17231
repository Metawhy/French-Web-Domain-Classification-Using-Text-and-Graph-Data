       Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II

Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II
       The Star Wars Saga continues with Star Wars: The Force Unleashed
       II, the highly anticipated sequel to the fastest-selling Star Wars
       game ever created, which has sold more than seven million copies
       worldwide. In Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, the world was
       introduced to Darth Vader’s now fugitive apprentice, Starkiller —
       the unlikely hero who would ignite the flames of rebellion in a
       galaxy so desperately in need of a champion. In the sequel,
       Starkiller returns with over-the-top Force powers and embarks on a
       journey to discover his own identity and to reunite with his one
       true love, Juno Eclipse. In Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II,
       Starkiller is once again the pawn of Darth Vader — but instead of
       training his protégée as a ruthless assassin, the dark lord is
       attempting to clone his former apprentice in an attempt to create
       the Ultimate Sith warrior. The chase is on — Starkiller is in
       pursuit of Juno and Darth Vader is hunting for Starkiller. With
       all-new devastating Force powers and the ability to dual-wield
       lightsabers, Starkiller cuts a swath through deadly new enemies
       across exciting worlds from the Star Wars movies — all in his
       desperate search for answers to his past.

   Darth Vader in Vader Immortal- Episode II.

   ILMxLAB // SEPTEMBER 25, 2019

Master the Force with Darth Vader in Vader Immortal – Episode II, Available
Now

Today, ILMxLAB debuted a new trailer and revealed that the next installment
of the immersive reality experience is out now!

   If you’ve ever dreamed of being trained in the ways of the Force by
   Darth Vader then today will be a day long remembered.

   During Oculus Connect 6 this morning, officials from ILMxLAB announced
   a surprise immediate release of Vader Immortal: A Star Wars VR Series –
   Episode II. That’s right, it’s available now! This news comes on the
   heels of an exciting new trailer for the immersive reality trilogy,
   which debuted for the convention crowd this morning and is available
   for you to watch below.

      IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/_qCQLs1QpXI?feature=oembed

   “One of virtual reality’s unique strengths is the power of presence —
   the ability to be transported to a different world and form connections
   with exciting characters you’ve previously only seen on a screen,” says
   Alyssa Finley, a senior producer on the project. “At its core, Vader
   Immortal offers players the chance to explore one central question:
   What would it be like to step into the Star Wars galaxy, and learn
   firsthand about Darth Vader’s mysterious plans?”

   Immortal- Episode II.

   While Episode I transported users to the molten planet of Mustafar to
   begin the quest for a mysterious ancient artifact, the next installment
   invites you to dig deeper into the lore, exploring the main character’s
   lineage and abilities with the Force, as well as digging into the
   planet itself to explore the cavernous labyrinth below Vader’s castle.

   Immortal- Episode II.

   “In developing Vader Immortal: Episode II, we wanted to build upon the
   foundation set in our first installment from both a story and
   interactive perspective,” says Supervisor of Experience Design Jose
   Perez III. Users will learn more about the mysterious Black Bishop and
   the ruins of the Corvaxian Fortress, gain a powerful and ancient weapon
   called the protosaber, and come face-to-snarling-face with the
   Darkghast.

   The Lightsaber Dojo in Vader Immortal- Episode II.

   Plus, spend some time in the new Lightsaber Dojo II, practicing Force
   moves and lightsaber techniques. “Using only a single button, you will
   be able to use the Force to stun, pick up, and fling your opponents
   across the arena,” says Perez. “You can even attack enemies from a
   distance by throwing your lightsaber at them. It’s seriously awesome.”

     * David S. Goyer and ILMxLAB’s Mohen Leo talk about the virtual
       reality experience’s creation.
     * Plus, get a look at concept art from Vader Immortal: Episode II
       revealed at San Diego Comic-Con and D23 this year!

       Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II

Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II
       The Star Wars Saga continues with Star Wars: The Force Unleashed
       II, the highly anticipated sequel to the fastest-selling Star Wars
       game ever created, which has sold more than seven million copies
       worldwide. In Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, the world was
       introduced to Darth Vader’s now fugitive apprentice, Starkiller —
       the unlikely hero who would ignite the flames of rebellion in a
       galaxy so desperately in need of a champion. In the sequel,
       Starkiller returns with over-the-top Force powers and embarks on a
       journey to discover his own identity and to reunite with his one
       true love, Juno Eclipse. In Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II,
       Starkiller is once again the pawn of Darth Vader — but instead of
       training his protégée as a ruthless assassin, the dark lord is
       attempting to clone his former apprentice in an attempt to create
       the Ultimate Sith warrior. The chase is on — Starkiller is in
       pursuit of Juno and Darth Vader is hunting for Starkiller. With
       all-new devastating Force powers and the ability to dual-wield
       lightsabers, Starkiller cuts a swath through deadly new enemies
       across exciting worlds from the Star Wars movies — all in his
       desperate search for answers to his past.

   Darth Vader in Vader Immortal- Episode II.

   ILMxLAB // SEPTEMBER 25, 2019

Master the Force with Darth Vader in Vader Immortal – Episode II, Available
Now

Today, ILMxLAB debuted a new trailer and revealed that the next installment
of the immersive reality experience is out now!

   If you’ve ever dreamed of being trained in the ways of the Force by
   Darth Vader then today will be a day long remembered.

   During Oculus Connect 6 this morning, officials from ILMxLAB announced
   a surprise immediate release of Vader Immortal: A Star Wars VR Series –
   Episode II. That’s right, it’s available now! This news comes on the
   heels of an exciting new trailer for the immersive reality trilogy,
   which debuted for the convention crowd this morning and is available
   for you to watch below.

      IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/_qCQLs1QpXI?feature=oembed

   “One of virtual reality’s unique strengths is the power of presence —
   the ability to be transported to a different world and form connections
   with exciting characters you’ve previously only seen on a screen,” says
   Alyssa Finley, a senior producer on the project. “At its core, Vader
   Immortal offers players the chance to explore one central question:
   What would it be like to step into the Star Wars galaxy, and learn
   firsthand about Darth Vader’s mysterious plans?”

   Immortal- Episode II.

   While Episode I transported users to the molten planet of Mustafar to
   begin the quest for a mysterious ancient artifact, the next installment
   invites you to dig deeper into the lore, exploring the main character’s
   lineage and abilities with the Force, as well as digging into the
   planet itself to explore the cavernous labyrinth below Vader’s castle.

   Immortal- Episode II.

   “In developing Vader Immortal: Episode II, we wanted to build upon the
   foundation set in our first installment from both a story and
   interactive perspective,” says Supervisor of Experience Design Jose
   Perez III. Users will learn more about the mysterious Black Bishop and
   the ruins of the Corvaxian Fortress, gain a powerful and ancient weapon
   called the protosaber, and come face-to-snarling-face with the
   Darkghast.

   The Lightsaber Dojo in Vader Immortal- Episode II.

   Plus, spend some time in the new Lightsaber Dojo II, practicing Force
   moves and lightsaber techniques. “Using only a single button, you will
   be able to use the Force to stun, pick up, and fling your opponents
   across the arena,” says Perez. “You can even attack enemies from a
   distance by throwing your lightsaber at them. It’s seriously awesome.”

       reality experience’s creation.

A Galaxy of Star Wars Stars Count Down to Triple Force Friday

Join Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Pedro Pascal, Gina Carano, and more for a
special first look at new Star Wars products before they hit shelves.

   Lucasfilm and stars from across the Star Wars saga will be unveiling

   Tune into YouTube.com/StarWars on Thursday, September 26, at 11 a.m. PT
   / 2 p.m. ET for a special livestream event based at Pinewood Studios in
   London, the famed shooting location of Star Wars: The Rise of
   Skywalker. Via live and recorded vignettes, generations of Star Wars
   icons will reveal new products in advance of their roll out on Triple
   Force Friday, October 4, all inspired by a trio of the year’s biggest
   Star Wars releases:

     * Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The highly-anticipated final
       installment of the Skywalker Saga, which hits theaters December 20
     * The Mandalorian: The first-ever Star Wars live-action series, which
       will debut in the US on November 12 exclusively on Disney+, the
       Walt Disney Company’s new streaming service
     * Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order: A brand-new action adventure game
       from Respawn, releasing November 15

   The livestream celebration will feature appearances from Daisy Ridley
   (Rey), John Boyega (Finn), Oscar Isaac (Poe), Anthony Daniels (C-3PO),
   Billy Dee Williams (Lando Calrissian), Joonas Suotamo (Chewbacca), Keri
   Russell (Zorii), Naomi Ackie (Jannah), Kelly Marie Tran (Rose), Pedro
   Pascal (The Mandalorian), Gina Carano (Cara Dune in The Mandalorian),
   and Cameron Monaghan (Cal Kestis in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order).
   Livestream viewers also will be treated to the worldwide premiere of a
   new trailer for Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, along with other special
   surprises from across the Star Wars galaxy. Warwick Davis, a beloved
   Star Wars actor known for his role as the Ewok “Wicket” in Star Wars:
   Return of the Jedi, will serve as host during the livestream event at
   Pinewood Studios, while Anthony Carboni (The Star Wars Show) will helm
   the recorded product reveals.

   Fans can join the conversation on social using Triple #ForceFriday.

Characters //

       Rey

Rey
       A scavenger toughened by life in Jakku’s harsh deserts, Rey has
       been drawn into a galaxy-spanning conflict and learned that her
       life is being shaped by the mysterious power of the Force. She
       seeks out Luke Skywalker, the lost Jedi Master, in hopes that he
       will aid the Resistance against the First Order and help her
       control her growing powers. But when that quest ends in
       disappointment, Rey must find a new way forward.

databank
       Kylo Ren

Kylo Ren
       The son of Han Solo and Leia Organa, Ben Solo was seduced by the
       dark side of the Force and renamed himself Kylo Ren, becoming the
       First Order’s champion and Supreme Leader Snoke’s student. Kylo
       killed his father and seeks to destroy his mother’s Resistance and
       the remnants of the Jedi Order. Though a servant of the dark side,
       he still struggles against the pull of the light side of the Force.

databank
       Finn

Finn
       FN-2187 was trained since birth to serve the First Order as a
       stormtrooper, but a skirmish on Jakku awakened his conscience and
       drove him down a different path, one that proved both heroic and
       dangerous. He helped Poe Dameron escape the First Order – picking
       up the nickname Finn in doing so – and then sought his own freedom
       alongside Rey and BB-8. Finn helped the Resistance destroy
       Starkiller Base, but had to decide his true loyalties: Would he
       continue to fight alongside the Resistance’s soldiers, or seek to
       reunite with Rey and flee the galactic conflict? At first Finn
       tried to flee the war, but a mission alongside Rose Tico convinced
       him that he had to commit himself to the Resistance’s cause.

databank
       Poe Dameron

Poe Dameron
       A commander in the Resistance’s starfighter corps, Poe Dameron is
       one of Leia Organa’s most-trusted operatives. A decorated X-wing
       pilot, he can fly anything – which is fortunate given how often his
       headstrong nature leads him into trouble. Poe leads the attack that
       destroys Starkiller Base, but soon finds himself on the run from
       the First Order. Sidelined without his beloved X-wing, he learns
       tough lessons about leadership, heroism and sacrifice.

databank
       Lando Calrissian

Lando Calrissian
       Lando Calrissian made a name for himself as captain of the
       Millennium Falcon and a sportsman seeking a fortune at the galaxy’s
       sabacc tables. After he lost his beloved ship to Han Solo, he spent
       years living the high life and pursuing get-rich-quick schemes,
       with uneven results. He went semi-respectable as the administrator
       of Cloud City, only to be drawn into the fight against the Empire.
       His quick wit and daring helped the Alliance destroy the second
       Death Star, completing Lando’s evolution from smooth-talking
       smuggler to galactic hero.

databank
       Chewbacca

Chewbacca
       During his long life Chewbacca has been many things: Wookiee
       warrior, ace smuggler and rebel hero. Chewie fought with the
       Republic on Kashyyyk during the Clone Wars, then befriended Han
       Solo while in Imperial captivity on Mimban. After adventures on
       Vandor and Kessel, he became Han’s co-pilot aboard the Millennium
       Falcon, and eventually helped the Alliance restore freedom to the
       galaxy. Known for his short temper and accuracy with a bowcaster,
       Chewie also had a big heart – and unflagging loyalty to his
       friends. He stuck with Han through years of turmoil, and flew the
       Falcon alongside Rey after the Corellian’s death.

databank
       Leia Organa

Leia Organa
       Princess Leia Organa was one of the Rebel Alliance’s greatest
       leaders, fearless on the battlefield and dedicated to ending the
       tyranny of the Empire. Daughter of Padmé Amidala and Anakin
       Skywalker, sister of Luke Skywalker, and with a soft spot for
       scoundrels, Leia ranks among the galaxy’s great heroes. But life
       under the New Republic has not been easy for Leia. Sidelined by a
       new generation of political leaders, she struck out on her own to
       oppose the First Order as founder of the Resistance. These setbacks
       in her political career have been accompanied by more personal
       losses.

       BB-8

BB-8
       A skittish but loyal astromech, BB-8 accompanied Poe Dameron on
       many missions for the Resistance, helping keep his X-wing in
       working order. When Poe’s mission to Jakku ended with his capture
       by the First Order, BB-8 fled into the desert with a vital clue to
       the location of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. He rejoined Poe and the
       service of the Resistance in time for the attack on Starkiller
       Base, then helped Rey locate Skywalker’s planet of exile.

       C-3PO (See-Threepio)

C-3PO (See-Threepio)
       C-3PO is a droid programmed for etiquette and protocol, built by
       the heroic Jedi Anakin Skywalker, and a constant companion to
       astromech R2-D2. Over the years, he was involved in some of the
       galaxy’s most defining moments and thrilling battles -- and is
       fluent in more than seven million forms of communication. In the
       years after the Empire’s defeat C-3PO served Leia Organa, becoming
       the head of a Resistance spy ring aimed at undermining the First
       Order.
