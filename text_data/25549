   Book Description

   Until now, there has been only one source of data on global fishery
   catches: information reported to the Food and Agriculture Organization
   of the United Nations by member countries. An extensive, ten-year study
   conducted by The Sea Around Us Project of the University of British
   Columbia shows that this catch data is fundamentally misleading. Many
   countries underreport the amount of fish caught (some by as much as
   500%), while others such as China significantly overreport their
   catches.
   The Global Atlas of Marine Fisheries is the first and only book to
   provide accurate, country-by-country fishery data. This groundbreaking
   information has been gathered from independent sources by the world’s
   foremost fisheries experts, and edited by Daniel Pauly and Dirk Zeller
   of the Sea Around Us Project. The Atlas includes one-page reports on
   273 countries and their territories, plus fourteen topical global
   chapters. National reports describe the state of the country's fishery,
   by sector; the policies, politics, and social factors affecting it; and
   potential solutions. The global chapters address cross-cutting issues,
   from the economics of fisheries to the impacts of mariculture.
   Extensive maps and graphics offer attractive and accessible visual
   representations.
   While it has long been clear that the world’s oceans are in trouble,
   the lack of reliable data on fishery catches has obscured the scale,
   and nuances, of the crisis. The atlas shows that, globally, catches
   have declined rapidly since the 1980s, signaling an even more critical
   situation than previously understood. The Global Atlas of Marine
   Fisheries provides a comprehensive picture of our current predicament
   and steps that can be taken to ease it. For researchers, students,
   fishery managers, professionals in the fishing industry, and all others
   concerned with the status of the world’s fisheries, the Atlas will be
   an indispensable resource.
   Review Quotes

   "A science-steeped volume that tells the story of finding the clearer
   window into fisheries we have today through the research itself...this
   data empowers fellow biologists, NGOs and policymakers to begin
   chipping away at the problems that face fisheries worldwide."
   Mongabay

   "Accurate data on catches is critical...thanks to [The Global Atlas of
   Marine Fisheries]...we have a much better knowledge of how much fish is
   being caught from the ocean."
   Journal of Fish Biology

   "Excellent fundamental background reading: from the sobering position
   of worldwide fish stocks, the economic and technical conditions,
   regulatory options up to individual country profiles, the reader is
   furnished with a rich treasure of information...For all those closely
   interested in or associated with the sea, this atlas is strongly
   recommended."
   MarineForum

   "Highly informative and intellectually compelling...Pauly and
   Zeller's Atlas will provide considerable grist for thoughtful
   discussion, reflection, and argument."
   Ocean Yearbook

   "Uses new methods to present a truer picture of world fish stocks and
   their exploitation, and explains what these methods are."
   Marine Quarterly

   "This book is the first to provide detailed fishery catch data covering
   literally the entire world's oceans...The atlas will be an
   indispensable resource and should inspire the management of marine
   fisheries in ways that will restore their productivity as opposed to
   accentuating their decline.
   Conservation Biology

   "The word monumental is overused but rarely has a book more deserved
   it. An extraordinary account of the state of the world's fisheries.
   Essential reading."
   Callum Roberts, Professor of Marine Conservation, University of York,
   England

   "This packed volume offers an all-you-can-eat buffet of information on
   global fisheries catches: comprehensive and provocative."
   Boris Worm, Professor in Marine Conservation Biology, Dalhousie
   University, Halifax, Canada

   "This timely publication makes a very significant contribution to our
   understanding of what is actually happening with the world's fisheries
   and effectively makes the case that improved management requires more
   holistic approaches and less institutional and disciplinary
   fragmentation."
   John Tanzer, Director, Global Marine Program, World Wildlife
   International

#ForewordFriday: Global Atlas of Marine Fisheries

   While it has long been clear that the world’s oceans are in trouble,
   the lack of reliable data on fishery catches has obscured the scale,
   and nuances, of the crisis. Based on an unprecedented 10-year research
   study by the world's foremost fisheries experts, the Global Atlas of
   Marine Fisheries will fundamentally change the way the world thinks
   about ocean exploitation and management. It is the first and only book
   to provide accurate, country-by-country fishery data. Edited by Daniel
   Pauly and Dirk Zeller, the book includes one-page reports on 273
   countries and their territories, plus fourteen topical global chapters.
   It will be an indispensable resource for researchers, students, fishery
   managers, professionals in the fishing industry, and all others
   concerned with the status of the world’s fisheries. Check out an
   excerpt from the book below.
