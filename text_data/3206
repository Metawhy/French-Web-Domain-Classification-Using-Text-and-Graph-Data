Rosalind Miller Cakes

   "Since I have been on the  5 Star Wedding Directory, I have been
   inundated with inquiries for my cakes and received some fantastic
   publicity from magazines who have seen me on there. I also made lots of
   very useful contacts at the Press Wedding Breakfast 5 Star Wedding
   Directory organized for suppliers and press. I was invited to take part
   in the Designer Wedding Show, have had my cakes shown in the Saatchi
   Gallery, and taken part in Wedding TV's "The Great Cake Bake". A lot of
   which I put down to being on the 5 Star Wedding Directory, so many
   thanks to 5 Star Weddings." Rosalind Miller
