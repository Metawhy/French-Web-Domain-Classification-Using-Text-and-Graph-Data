          SHINY NEW MODEL
          ///
          People ask me : Ben what’s the deal with all these ATMS?
          Well have I not been thorough or clear or concise enough?
          Tell me don’t you relate to the state of that silver sepulchre?
          Tell me don’t you feel used? Buttons pressed in the back of
          bodega.
          In the aisle by the cleaning supplies.
          In the corner by the stale crackers.
          You can increase up your service charge but you’re competing
          with a shiny new model. Swipe.
          You can increase but you’ll be replaced by a shiny new model.
          Swipe.
          Shiny new model.
          Swipe.
          Hey I caught you staring at the plastic covered by a layer of
          dust.
          It said that every woman and man is a microcosm of lust.
          Exchange your data. Pray it will save you from a data dictator.
          It said the people exploited just can’t be avoided if your
          life’s enjoyed with…
          All the bottles and the stale Pringles.
          All the six packs and the paper towels.
          Yet you give nothing expecting much as you stare into your shiny
          new model. Swipe.
          Yet you give nothing expecting to touch as you stare into your
          shiny new model. Swipe.
          Shiny new model. Swipe.
          Shiny new model.
          Swipe.

       Over Easy
       by Diet Cig
       supported by 9 fans who also own “Shiny New Model”
       At their fun live shows, this upstate NY pop-punk duo is extremely
       energetic and super enthusiastic - lots of jumping and kicking by
       singer/guitarist Alex Luciano - she must have a spring for a spine.
       But more importantly, the songs are catchy. They also released a 7"
       in 2015 and a full-length coming out in 2017, Live video:

       Coolest, most original band I've heard in ages. Eclectic & tons of

          SHINY NEW MODEL
          ///
          People ask me : Ben what’s the deal with all these ATMS?
          Well have I not been thorough or clear or concise enough?
          Tell me don’t you relate to the state of that silver sepulchre?
          Tell me don’t you feel used? Buttons pressed in the back of
          bodega.
          In the aisle by the cleaning supplies.
          In the corner by the stale crackers.
          You can increase up your service charge but you’re competing
          with a shiny new model. Swipe.
          You can increase but you’ll be replaced by a shiny new model.
          Swipe.
          Shiny new model.
          Swipe.
          Hey I caught you staring at the plastic covered by a layer of
          dust.
          It said that every woman and man is a microcosm of lust.
          Exchange your data. Pray it will save you from a data dictator.
          It said the people exploited just can’t be avoided if your
          life’s enjoyed with…
          All the bottles and the stale Pringles.
          All the six packs and the paper towels.
          Yet you give nothing expecting much as you stare into your shiny
          new model. Swipe.
          Yet you give nothing expecting to touch as you stare into your
          shiny new model. Swipe.
          Shiny new model. Swipe.
          Shiny new model.
          Swipe.

       energetic and super enthusiastic - lots of jumping and kicking by
       singer/guitarist Alex Luciano - she must have a spring for a spine.
       But more importantly, the songs are catchy. They also released a 7"
