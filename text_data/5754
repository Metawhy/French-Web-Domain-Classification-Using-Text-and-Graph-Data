   "Keystone has helped us increase our program exposure in international
   markets. Before advertising on their website, our program was reaching
   only students from a specific area of the world. Now we are seeing
   requests for information come in from countries we had never received
   inquires from. This is really going to help us create a very diverse
   experience for the students who come into the program."

   -Renata Berto, Joan B. Kroc School of Peace Studies, University of San
   Diego, USA

   "SmartHub has helped the Condé Nast College immensely. As a small team,
   we’re often overwhelmed by student queries and the automation of this
   system has helped support our communication with prospective students.
   The team at Keystone Academic have been so helpful to us and we would
   strongly recommend the system to any education provider."

   -Celeste Good, Condé Nast College of Fashion & Design

   “After working with Keystone for several years I consider it to be one
   of the best investments we’ve ever engaged with at EADA Business
   School. Their conversion rate from qualified student to enrollment has
   been satisfactory as well as the ROI. I would also like to mention
   their high level of customer care and their constant availability when
   offering customized solutions”

   "Keystone has provided USF tremendous outreach to international markets
   that have been previously difficult to reach. In our first year
   campaign with Keystone, we were excited to receive a significant number
   of applications from Keystone. The internal interface and traffic
   reports for university administrators stands well above"

   -Mark Landerghini, University of San Francisco

   "Keystone is perfect in its purpose of being a bridge between the
   school and students. I receive many emails every single day. The
   technology aspect is also perfect. Keystone was very fast in its
   procedures to put us online. Before I knew it, it was ready to use. The
   customer service is very professional; everything we ask is immediately
   considered. We have the same person from the very beginning, sticking
   with us, fighting with and for us, in a way that we can always use 100%
   of Keystone ability to put potential students and us face to face.
   Thank you Keystone, for introducing us to the rest of the world and
   them to us."
