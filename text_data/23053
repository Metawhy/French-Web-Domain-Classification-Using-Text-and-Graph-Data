   ponzi-pyramid-scheme-fiat-federal-reserve Only humans would create a
   system where we give value to little pieces of paper that determines
   who lives and who dies. We don’t need to have a system which requires
   us to obtain this paper in order  to have access to food, water,
   clothing, health, shelter and more; life on this planet should be free
   for everybody. Unfortunately we continue to see worth in something that
   is not even real. Our desires and goals have been programmed into us.
   We want materialistic things, but only because we have been made to
   want them. It’s time to let go of this system, get in touch with
   ourselves and find what we truly want, not what someone else tells us
   to want.

   Gone are the days where possible solutions are not feasible to
   implement. We have more than enough resources to provide for everyone.
   Economics and finance are just excuses used as to why we cannot
   implement them. The way we do things here on Earth is not working, and
   a growing majority are feeling the need for change. That collective
   feeling is pushing us towards action, with many doing whatever they can
   to help create change the best way they know how.

   Why we still chose to believe that money is a necessity for survival is
   beyond me. Money is not a necessity for survival, cooperation is. We’ve
   been led into a system that forces us to fend for ourselves, and as a
   result we’ve neglected that part within us that knows better. Money is
   a tool used to boost our ego, create separation, promote greed and lose
   sight of what is really valuable on this planet. It controls our
   everyday lives and dictates why we do things and how we do them. Money
   makes us dependent on someone else, when we could easily be dependent
   on ourselves. While participating in the chase for money, we’ve
   neglected ourselves, our planet and every being that resides upon it.

   We don’t have to limit ourselves to this type of thinking, we can
   create something better here. We can have a system that gives everybody
   more than what they could have imagined, without money, but with
   cooperation and learning how to live in balance and harmony with the
   planet.

     One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been
     bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the
     bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The
     bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge,
     even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan
     power over you, you almost never get it back – Carl Sagan

   It’s not a secret anymore, an elite group of people and the
   corporations they run have control over our energy, food supply,
   education, health care and almost every aspect of our lives. Within
   these industries is a great need for change, and multiple solutions are
   available for each. This used to be a conspiracy, now it’s a global
   fact. They do this by controlling the source of money.
   [INS: :INS]

   Money isn’t real. It requires us to value it. When people are denied
   basic human rights because they don’t have any, it’s criminal. The girl
   in the video below makes some excellent points. One of them being, if
   you go to the bank and ask for 10 000 dollars, the bank will
   electronically type into your account that exact amount. This is all
   they do, they don’t print any money, they just put the money into your
   account on a computer screen. From that moment you start paying
   interest on money that does not exist, and never did. Banks have
   approximately nine times as much money loaned out as they do in their
   vaults, this is possible because of what is refereed to as fractional
   reserve lending. The federal reserve is legally aloud to determine how
   much a bank can have on reserve.

   If you deposit 10,000 into a bank, the bank sets aside 10 percent and
   then loans out the rest of your money. If another person comes into the
   bank and asks for a loan for a car, the bank will loan out a percentage
   of the money you originally deposited, which means it’s not there
   anymore. The borrower then pays the person selling the car, and they go
   deposit that into another bank which is part of the same central
   banking system. That deposit is treated the exact same way, and the
   process continues. To watch a visual demonstration, click here.

   At the end of the day, in the current paradigm we are living in it’s
   easy to see how money is a necessity. We do need it to eat and put
   clothes on our back. On the other hand, it occupies the mind of so
   many, and drives their entire life. Handing your power over to
   something so ridiculous can make one loose sight of what’s really
   important. This system we have created, a system that requires us to
   obtain pieces of paper in order to acquire basic needs is one we don’t
   need to play with anymore. The human race is capable of much more than
   this.

Big Pharma CEO: “My Primary Responsibility is to Shareholders”

   Published
   2 days ago

   on
   October 1, 2019

   By
   Arjun Walia CE Staff Writer

In Brief

     * The Facts:
       A recent interview with Michael Pearson, the CEO of Valeant
       Pharmaceuticals, outlined the importance of keeping shareholders
       happy.
     * Reflect On:
       Are pharmaceutical companies in the business of health care, or
       sick care? Is their priority profit or helping to cure and treat
       people?

   The truth, as explained by Dr. Marcia Angell, a physician and longtime
   Editor-in-Chief of the New England Medical Journal (NEMJ), one of the
   most prestigious peer-reviewed medical journals in the world
   alongside The Lancet, is that “it is simply no longer possible to
   believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on
   the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines.
   I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and
   reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of The New England Journal
   of Medicine.”  (source)

   Arnold Symour Relman, a Harvard professor of medicine and also a former
   Editor-in-Chief of The New England Medical Journal also made it quite
   clear that “The medical profession is being bought by the
   pharmaceutical industry, not only in terms of the practice of medicine,
   but also in terms of teaching and research. The academic institutions
   of this country are allowing themselves to be the paid agents of
   the pharmaceutical industry. I think
   it’s disgraceful.”  (source)(source)

   At the end of the day, when it comes to medicine, it’s not really about
   healthcare, it’s more so about making money. This is why prescription
   drug use is one of the leading causes of death in the United States.
   It’s also why substances that can’t be patented like cannabis, for
   example, never really get funding for clinical trials because
   pharmaceutical companies can’t make money off them.

   Pharmaceutical companies are not in the business of healthcare, which
   is why doctors don’t know much about nutrition and are simply trained
   to use and prescribe drugs, while at the same time being convinced that
   these medicines are completely safe and effective and the best way to
   go about treating, healing and curing diseases.

   A recent interview with Michael Pearson, the CEO of Valeant
   Pharmaceuticals, outlined the importance of keeping the shareholders
   happy. The interview was with regards to raising drug prices, and
   really sheds light on the importance of making money and how it always
   seems to be the main focus of pharmaceutical companies.

     The main reason we take so many drugs is that drug companies don’t
     sell drugs, they sell lies about drugs. This is what makes drugs so
     different from anything else in life… Virtually everything we know
     about drugs is what the companies have chosen to tell us and our
     doctors… the reason patients trust their medicine is that they
     extrapolate the trust they have in their doctors into the medicines
     they prescribe.

   [INS: :INS]
   advertisement - learn more

     The patients don’t realize that, although their doctors may know a
     lot about diseases and human physiology and psychology, they know
     very, very little about drugs that’ve been carefully concocted and
     dressed up by the drug industry… If you don’t think the system is
     out of control, please email me and explain why drugs are the third
     leading cause of death… If such a hugely lethal epidemic had been
     caused by a new bacterium or a virus, or even one-hundredth of it,
     we would have done everything we could to get it under control.”
     – Dr. Peter Gotzsche, co-founder of the Cochrane Collaboration
     (source)

   The statement above reveals the truth. It’s also important to note the
   corruption that plagues our medical industry. The medical industry has
   been completely compromised by big corporations. There are several
   great examples that illustrate this point, in fact there are
   decades worth of examples. One of the best would be the SPIDER papers.
   A group called the CDC Scientists Preserving Integrity, Diligence and
   Ethics in Research, or CDC SPIDER, put a list of complaints in a letter
   to the CDC Chief of Staff and provided a copy of the letter to the
   public watchdog organization U.S. Right to Know (USRTK).

     We are a group of scientists at CDC that are very concerned about
     the current state of ethics at our agency.  It appears that
     our mission is being influenced and shaped by outside parties and
     rogue interests. It seems that our mission and Congressional intent
     for our agency is being circumvented by some of our leaders. What
     concerns us most, is that it is becoming the norm
     and not the rare exception. Some senior management officials at CDC
     are clearly aware and even condone these behaviors.

   This is no secret, yet it never really gets any media
   attention. Everybody should know by now that pharmaceutical companies
   are extremely unethical, and that they have a very tight stranglehold
   over government health regulatory agencies like the Centers For Disease
   Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food & Drug Administration (FDA).
   According to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., pharmaceutical companies have more
   lobbyists in Washington D.C. than there are congressmen and senators
   combined. They are even more powerful than big oil and gas, so you can
   just imagine the power they exercise over politicians and our federal
   health regulatory agencies. It’s also important to point out the
   revolving door that exists between big pharma and federal health
   regulatory agencies. Julie Gerberding, the Healthcare Businesswomen’s
   Association ‘Woman of the Year,’ is a prime example of someone who has
   gone through the revolving door between government regulatory agencies
   and the corporations they are supposed to be regulating. She was once
   the Director of the CDC before moving over to an executive position at
   Merck.

The Takeaway

   This article sheds only a small tidbit of light on the corruption that
   plagues the pharmaceutical industry. When it’s clear that the medical
   industry is not concerned about our health like it should be, it’s
   understandable why more people are choosing to take their health into
   their own hands. This does not mean that the medical industry does not
   have it’s positives, but when it comes to drugs and treatment
   specifically, a big problem exists.

Vatican Insider & Author Accuse Pope Francis of Facilitating The Sexual
Abuse, Trafficking & Death of Children

   Published
   3 days ago

   on
   October 1, 2019

   By
   Arjun Walia CE Staff Writer

In Brief

     * The Facts:
       Vatican insider Carlo Maria Vigano, “Titular Archbishop of Ulpiana
       Apostolic Nuncio,” has accused Pope Francis of facilitating sexual
       abuse of Children. Author and journalist Kevin Annett has done the
       same presenting some disturbing evidence.
     * Reflect On:
       How has the sexual abuse of children been allowed to carry on in
       places of high power in influence for so long? Who is exactly
       involved? Does this go all the way to the top?

   If you don’t already know, a number of Vatican officials over the years
   have been implicated in sexually abusing children. In fact, it goes
   well beyond the main church inside the walls of Vatican city, and into
   various churches around the world that are connected to the Roman
   Catholic Order, among others.

   Although there is probably much more going on behind the scenes that
   has yet to be revealed, the criminal actions of many high-ranking
   members have still come to light, with the most recent example being
   Cardinal George Pell. Pell was just convicted on five counts of child
   sexual abuse. He has now become the most senior official ever to be
   found guilty, serving as an advisor to Pope Benedict as well as Pope
   Francis. He’s one of the Vatican’s most powerful officials.

   In addition, decades worth of sexual abuse was reported in a choir led
   by the retired Pope Benedict’s brother. Approximately 600 members of a
   Catholic boys’ Domspatzen choir in Regensburg, Germany were physically
   and sexually abused from 1945 to 1992. Georg Ratzinger (Benedict’s
   brother) was the choir’s head from 1964 to 1994. In 2015, a lawyer by
   the name of Ulrich Weber was tasked with filing a report on what
   happened, and uncovered the startling fact that during the 30 years the
   choir was run by Benedict’s older brother, approximately 600 boys with
   a “high degree of plausibility” were victims of sexual and/or physical
   abuse.

   The list literally goes on and on. Not long ago, 34 Chilean Bishops
   from the Catholic Church were implicated in the sexual abuse of young
   boys. You can read more about that here.

   What’s even more disturbing is that this type of activity bleeds down
   from the Church and into Royal Families, politics, and big
   entertainment. It seems to be quite common in places of great power,
   and perhaps they’re all tied together somehow in one ‘big club.’ This
   thought used to be a ‘conspiracy theory,’ but people are now starting
   to see that it’s a fact.

   But why does this issue never get resolved? It’s an important question
   to ask. These are very powerful people who basically control the
   judicial system as well as the mainstream media. Because of their
   power, they are able to protect themselves from ‘punishment.’ Let’s use
   the Catholic Church, for example, who is headed by the Pope, a person
   who could very well have been placed there by higher authorities and is
   simply another puppet used for their power.
   [INS: :INS]
   advertisement - learn more

   Perhaps one reason this issue hasn’t been solved within the Vatican is
   because the Pope himself is involved in this type of activity. Carlo
   Maria Vigano, “Titular Archbishop of Ulpiana Apostolic Nuncio,” retired
   in 2016 after serving as the Apostolic Nuncio to the United States. He
   also previously served as Secretary-General of the Governor of Vatican
   City state from July 16th, 2009 to September 3rd, 2011.

   He recently released a bombshell 11-page written testament that offers
   information on “who in the hierarchy knew what, and when, about the
   crimes of Cardinal McCarrick.” The testimony implicates multiple
   high-ranking officials within the church including Pope Francis.
   McCarrick was recently removed from his post in June 2018 because of
   child sexual abuse allegations. This document shows how that process
   was delayed (his activities were learned of nearly two decades ago),
   and how the Pope did as much as he could to protect McCarrick.

   Why would the Pope do such a thing?

   Before we go any further, I think it’s important to mention the
   ritualistic aspect in this type of activity. Not long ago, the Pope
   compared the practice of sexually abusing a child to that of a “Satanic
   mass.” Based on our own research, we believe that this type of abuse to
   children is used in Satanic rituals. This is why it was odd when he
   said this, which also sparked a reaction from his colleague standing
   next to him.

   Manly P. Hall, one of the foremost scholars in the Occult, writes in
   his book, The Secret Teachings of All Ages:

     “By means of the secret processes of ceremonial magic it is possible
     to contact these invisible creatures and gain their help in some
     human undertaking. Good spirits willingly lend their assistance to
     any worthy enterprise, but evil spirits serve only those who live to
     pervert and destroy. . . . The most dangerous form of black magic is
     the scientific perversion of occult power for the gratification of
     personal desire.”

   This may give us a glimpse into what exactly the Pope was talking
   about. According to Malachi Martin, an Irish Catholic priest and writer
   on the Catholic Church who became a Professor of Palaeography at the
   Vatican’s Pontifical Biblical Institute:

     “Most frighteningly for [Pope] John Paul [II], he had come up
     against the irremovable presence of a malign strength in his own
     Vatican and in certain bishops’ chanceries. It was what
     knowledgeable Churchmen called the ‘superforce.’ Rumors, always
     difficult to verify, tied its installation to the beginning of Pope
     Paul VI’s reign in 1963. Indeed Paul had alluded sombrely to ‘the
     smoke of Satan which has entered the Sanctuary’. . . an oblique
     reference to an enthronement ceremony by Satanists in the Vatican.
     Besides, the incidence of Satanic pedophilia – rites and practices –
     was already documented among certain bishops and priests as widely
     dispersed as Turin, in Italy, and South Carolina, in the United
     States. The cultic acts of Satanic pedophilia are considered by
     professionals to be the culmination of the Fallen Archangel’s
     rites.”
     (Written in Hall’s book about  geopolitics and the Vatican, “The
     Keys of This Blood,” page 632)

   What about politics? The Bohemian Grove? What goes on there? Dark
   rituals like the ‘Cremation of Care’ are performed every year at
   Bohemian Grove. Whether these are real or mock sacrifices, they impact
   participants by dulling and eliminating their sense of ‘care’ and
   empathy for others and their conscience. There stands a giant owl, who
   some claim represents Moloch. Moloch is an ancient God to which,
   according to some world religions, some people sacrificed children to.
   Apparently, it was the only way to deal with the anger of this God.
   (source) You can read more about Bohemian Grove and view a picture of
   the giant owl there, here.

   Why are there Wikileaks documents that even mention Moloch being sent
   to and from Hillary Clinton? I’m not even going to get into the many
   examples within US politics, the State Department, and more that have
   been implicated in this type of activity. You can see some more
   examples in this recent article I wrote about Jeffrey Epstein.

   Researcher Kevin Annett, author of Hidden from History, The Canadian
   Holocaust has spent a lot of time researching the crimes of the church,
   especially when it comes to the treatment of the indigenous people in
   Canada. In fact, his work was how I came across the testimony of
   William Coombes, who exposed Elizabeth II for abducting multiple
   children, something he saw with his own eyes when the queen and her
   husband paid a visit to his “school.”  You can read more about that and
   watch Williams’ testimony here.

   Kevin has done some amazing work, and has a great relationship with
   many elders. He’s produced documentaries and interviewed many surviving
   elders.  He is the Secretary, The Truth Commission into Genocide in
   Canada (established September 3, 2000 in Vancouver, BC from a mandate
   arising from the IHRAAM Tribunal into Canadian Residential Schools,
   June 12-14, 1998, Vancouver). He Organized IHRAAM Tribunal into
   Canadian Residential Schools, under the auspices of the United Nations,
   June 12-14, 1998, Vancouver, and served as Advisor and authored final
   report of the Tribunal. You can view his entire biography here.

   Despite all of his accomplishments, he has been ignored, demonized, and
   touted as a “phoney” or a fraud by some on the internet. It’s
   understandable that, for anyone who has looked into his work, it’s
   quite clear that he’s not. He has faced much adversity. He is one of
   the main organizers of the  International Tribunal of Crimes of Church
   and State (ITCCS).

   The screen shots below are taken from his website, where he archives
   much of the initiatives taken by the ITCCS.

   Kevin uploaded a video to his Youtube Account a few years earlier going
   into detail about a document he and his colleagues produced. The title
   reads “Pope Francis is Named By Former Argentine junta insider as
   “prime mover” in child trafficking network.”

   This is interesting because in 1972, Chile fell to a U.S.-backed coup
   that led to the rise of a military dictatorship of General Augusto
   Pinochet. At the time, the Cardinal of Santiago, Raúl Silva
   Henríquez, took a stand against the newly-installed military
   regime, posing great risk to his own life, a move that is believed to
   have somewhat curbed the tide of political assassinations and torture
   targeting supporters of Chile’s deposed President Salvador Allende and
   other opponents of Pinochet’s rule.

   In 1976, Argentina also fell victim to a U.S.-backed coup that
   installed a military junta. However, the Catholic church’s response to
   the Videla regime could not have been more different than what had
   transpired in Chile.

   As Whitney Webb from MintPress News writes and documents:

     At the time, Pope Francis, then known by his birth name Jorge Mario
     Bergoglio, was Provincial of the Argentine Jesuits. While a handful
     of figures in the Catholic church dissented against Videla’s rule,
     Bergoglio was not one of them. In fact, Bergoglio actually aided the
     Videla regime in its murder of dissidents. Government
     documents written at the time have confirmed his role in reporting
     members of his own order who he deemed to be “leftists,” along with
     several innocent parishioners, to the military government.

   This is a somewhat corroborative look into the claims of Annett in the
   video above.

   Quite shocking and eye opening, isn’t it?

The Push For Mandatory Vaccines Is Galvanizing A Resistance Movement

   Published
   3 days ago

   on
   September 30, 2019

   By
   Richard Enos CE Staff Writer

In Brief

     * The Facts:
       Severe mandatory vaccination laws are suddenly popping up and
       getting passed in several states of late, but not without a fierce
       and growing opposition.
     * Reflect On:
       Will these mandatory vaccine laws, which are not about vaccines but
       rather about our individual sovereignty, catalyze us towards a
       greater emancipation from governmental interference and control?

   The push for mandatory vaccines seems to be gaining momentum in the
   United States. To be more precise, states are beginning to look more at
   removing exemptions which currently allow non-vaccinated children to
   attend school. As per the CDC, each individual state has vaccination
   requirements for daycare and school entry that often apply not only to
   children attending public schools, but also to those attending private
   schools and daycare facilities. All states provide medical exemptions,
   and some state laws also offer exemptions for religious and/or
   philosophical reasons. State laws also establish mechanisms for
   enforcement of school vaccination requirements and exemptions.

   Some states are in the process of attempting to remove, or have already
   removed, religious and philosophical exemptions. And in California,
   where they have already removed religious and philosophical exemptions,
   they have just passed a law that gives lawmakers, not doctors, the
   final authority of whether or not a medical exemption will be approved.

   In the latest episode of The Collective Evolution Show on CETV, Joe
   Martino and I examine the push for more stringent mandatory vaccines
   laws that are arising in several state legislatures. The clip below is
   the first segment. You can watch the full episode by signing up for a
   free 7-day trial on CETV.

California Bill SB276

   Very much in the news has been California’s Bill SB276. As mentioned,
   the new law puts medical exemptions under the authority of the
   government rather than doctors. The popular resistance to this was
   significant, and because of pressure put onto Senator Richard Pan, the
   sponsor of the bill, as well as Governor Gavin Newsome. At Newsome’s
   request, a tag-along companion Bill SB714, which made some
   concessions to protect existing medical exemptions, was also signed
   into law with the passage of SB276.

   With SB276 becoming law, a strong contingent of citizens have been
   galvanized to stay together and fight to reverse the impact of this
   bill, which, in combination with earlier changes that removed religious
   and philosophical exemptions in California, forces parents in
   California to have their children fully vaccinated if they are to go to
   public or private school. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. gave a rousing speech
   right after the bill was passed into law, and certainly gives rise to
   the belief that opposing mandatory vaccinations is the new civil rights
   movement in the United States, one which RFK Jr. underscored as ‘the
   most important battle, probably, in human history.’

Maine Bill 798

   In Maine, LD798 recently passed into law. It removes ALL philosophical
   and religious exemptions for vaccines and will potentially impact 8000
   children in the state as far as their inability to go to school until
   they are fully vaccinated. However, after the legislation passed, a
   group entitled ‘Mainers for Health and Parental Rights’ was formed and
   organized to enact a ‘People’s Veto’ on this law, described below:

     The people’s veto is a constitutional provision (Art. 4, Pt.3, §17)
     that allows the citizens of Maine, through the initiative and
     referendum process, to repeal a piece of legislation passed by the
     legislature. The people’s veto came into being as part of the
     initiative and referendum process enacted in 1909.  To repeal a
     particular piece of legislation, a petition must be presented within
     90 days of legislative adjournment and meet the signature
     requirements of any initiative proposal.  If the petition is
     certified, the law is set aside until the issue can be voted on at
     the next election.

   The requirement was that 64,000 signatures of Maine Voters (of which
   there are just over 1M in the state) needed to be collected within 90
   days of the legislation being passed. On September  16^th, the group
   presented almost 93,000 signatures to the government, which represents
   the herculean effort of getting consent from almost 10% of voters in
   the entire state! This ensured that the law would be set aside until
   elections next March, where LD798 will be on the ballot for the people
   of Maine to vote upon.

The Takeaway

   If we are to evolve, we must walk through our darkness rather than
   avoiding it. Complementing the internal work of examining our personal
   shadow, conscious activism involves the collective external
   actions that confront the darkness of humanity, where we stand firmly
   for what we believe in.

   As we work to awaken our fellow human beings to the notion that the
   government and the corporations do not work in our self-interest, the
   momentum that these movements create could not only empower us within
   the political process, but more importantly help us in stepping away
   from the current political system entirely.

   ponzi-pyramid-scheme-fiat-federal-reserve Only humans would create a
   system where we give value to little pieces of paper that determines
   who lives and who dies. We don’t need to have a system which requires
   us to obtain this paper in order  to have access to food, water,
   clothing, health, shelter and more; life on this planet should be free
   for everybody. Unfortunately we continue to see worth in something that
   is not even real. Our desires and goals have been programmed into us.
   We want materialistic things, but only because we have been made to
   want them. It’s time to let go of this system, get in touch with
   ourselves and find what we truly want, not what someone else tells us
   to want.

   Gone are the days where possible solutions are not feasible to
   implement. We have more than enough resources to provide for everyone.
   Economics and finance are just excuses used as to why we cannot
   implement them. The way we do things here on Earth is not working, and
   a growing majority are feeling the need for change. That collective
   feeling is pushing us towards action, with many doing whatever they can
   to help create change the best way they know how.

   Why we still chose to believe that money is a necessity for survival is
   beyond me. Money is not a necessity for survival, cooperation is. We’ve
   been led into a system that forces us to fend for ourselves, and as a
   result we’ve neglected that part within us that knows better. Money is
   a tool used to boost our ego, create separation, promote greed and lose
   sight of what is really valuable on this planet. It controls our
   everyday lives and dictates why we do things and how we do them. Money
   makes us dependent on someone else, when we could easily be dependent
   on ourselves. While participating in the chase for money, we’ve
   neglected ourselves, our planet and every being that resides upon it.

   We don’t have to limit ourselves to this type of thinking, we can
   create something better here. We can have a system that gives everybody
   more than what they could have imagined, without money, but with
   cooperation and learning how to live in balance and harmony with the
   planet.

     One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been
     bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the
     bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The
     bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge,
     even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan
     power over you, you almost never get it back – Carl Sagan

   It’s not a secret anymore, an elite group of people and the
   corporations they run have control over our energy, food supply,
   education, health care and almost every aspect of our lives. Within
   these industries is a great need for change, and multiple solutions are
   available for each. This used to be a conspiracy, now it’s a global
   fact. They do this by controlling the source of money.
   [INS: :INS]

   Money isn’t real. It requires us to value it. When people are denied
   basic human rights because they don’t have any, it’s criminal. The girl
   in the video below makes some excellent points. One of them being, if
   you go to the bank and ask for 10 000 dollars, the bank will
   electronically type into your account that exact amount. This is all
   they do, they don’t print any money, they just put the money into your
   account on a computer screen. From that moment you start paying
   interest on money that does not exist, and never did. Banks have
   approximately nine times as much money loaned out as they do in their
   vaults, this is possible because of what is refereed to as fractional
   reserve lending. The federal reserve is legally aloud to determine how
   much a bank can have on reserve.

   If you deposit 10,000 into a bank, the bank sets aside 10 percent and
   then loans out the rest of your money. If another person comes into the
   bank and asks for a loan for a car, the bank will loan out a percentage
   of the money you originally deposited, which means it’s not there
   anymore. The borrower then pays the person selling the car, and they go
   deposit that into another bank which is part of the same central
   banking system. That deposit is treated the exact same way, and the
   process continues. To watch a visual demonstration, click here.

   At the end of the day, in the current paradigm we are living in it’s
   easy to see how money is a necessity. We do need it to eat and put
   clothes on our back. On the other hand, it occupies the mind of so
   many, and drives their entire life. Handing your power over to
   something so ridiculous can make one loose sight of what’s really
   important. This system we have created, a system that requires us to
   obtain pieces of paper in order to acquire basic needs is one we don’t
   need to play with anymore. The human race is capable of much more than
   this.

Big Pharma CEO: “My Primary Responsibility is to Shareholders”

   Published
   2 days ago

   on
   October 1, 2019

   By
   Arjun Walia CE Staff Writer

In Brief

     * The Facts:
       A recent interview with Michael Pearson, the CEO of Valeant
       Pharmaceuticals, outlined the importance of keeping shareholders
       happy.
     * Reflect On:
       Are pharmaceutical companies in the business of health care, or
       sick care? Is their priority profit or helping to cure and treat
       people?

   The truth, as explained by Dr. Marcia Angell, a physician and longtime
   Editor-in-Chief of the New England Medical Journal (NEMJ), one of the
   most prestigious peer-reviewed medical journals in the world
   alongside The Lancet, is that “it is simply no longer possible to
   believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on
   the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines.
   I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and
   reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of The New England Journal
   of Medicine.”  (source)

   Arnold Symour Relman, a Harvard professor of medicine and also a former
   Editor-in-Chief of The New England Medical Journal also made it quite
   clear that “The medical profession is being bought by the
   pharmaceutical industry, not only in terms of the practice of medicine,
   but also in terms of teaching and research. The academic institutions
   of this country are allowing themselves to be the paid agents of
   the pharmaceutical industry. I think
   it’s disgraceful.”  (source)(source)

   At the end of the day, when it comes to medicine, it’s not really about
   healthcare, it’s more so about making money. This is why prescription
   drug use is one of the leading causes of death in the United States.
   It’s also why substances that can’t be patented like cannabis, for
   example, never really get funding for clinical trials because
   pharmaceutical companies can’t make money off them.

   Pharmaceutical companies are not in the business of healthcare, which
   is why doctors don’t know much about nutrition and are simply trained
   to use and prescribe drugs, while at the same time being convinced that
   these medicines are completely safe and effective and the best way to
   go about treating, healing and curing diseases.

   A recent interview with Michael Pearson, the CEO of Valeant
   Pharmaceuticals, outlined the importance of keeping the shareholders
   happy. The interview was with regards to raising drug prices, and
   really sheds light on the importance of making money and how it always
   seems to be the main focus of pharmaceutical companies.

     The main reason we take so many drugs is that drug companies don’t
     sell drugs, they sell lies about drugs. This is what makes drugs so
     different from anything else in life… Virtually everything we know
     about drugs is what the companies have chosen to tell us and our
     doctors… the reason patients trust their medicine is that they
     extrapolate the trust they have in their doctors into the medicines
     they prescribe.

   [INS: :INS]
   advertisement - learn more

     The patients don’t realize that, although their doctors may know a
     lot about diseases and human physiology and psychology, they know
     very, very little about drugs that’ve been carefully concocted and
     dressed up by the drug industry… If you don’t think the system is
     out of control, please email me and explain why drugs are the third
     leading cause of death… If such a hugely lethal epidemic had been
     caused by a new bacterium or a virus, or even one-hundredth of it,
     we would have done everything we could to get it under control.”
     – Dr. Peter Gotzsche, co-founder of the Cochrane Collaboration
     (source)

   The statement above reveals the truth. It’s also important to note the
   corruption that plagues our medical industry. The medical industry has
   been completely compromised by big corporations. There are several
   great examples that illustrate this point, in fact there are
   decades worth of examples. One of the best would be the SPIDER papers.
   A group called the CDC Scientists Preserving Integrity, Diligence and
   Ethics in Research, or CDC SPIDER, put a list of complaints in a letter
   to the CDC Chief of Staff and provided a copy of the letter to the
   public watchdog organization U.S. Right to Know (USRTK).

     We are a group of scientists at CDC that are very concerned about
     the current state of ethics at our agency.  It appears that
     our mission is being influenced and shaped by outside parties and
     rogue interests. It seems that our mission and Congressional intent
     for our agency is being circumvented by some of our leaders. What
     concerns us most, is that it is becoming the norm
     and not the rare exception. Some senior management officials at CDC
     are clearly aware and even condone these behaviors.

   This is no secret, yet it never really gets any media
   attention. Everybody should know by now that pharmaceutical companies
   are extremely unethical, and that they have a very tight stranglehold
   over government health regulatory agencies like the Centers For Disease
   Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food & Drug Administration (FDA).
   According to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., pharmaceutical companies have more
   lobbyists in Washington D.C. than there are congressmen and senators
   combined. They are even more powerful than big oil and gas, so you can
   just imagine the power they exercise over politicians and our federal
   health regulatory agencies. It’s also important to point out the
   revolving door that exists between big pharma and federal health
   regulatory agencies. Julie Gerberding, the Healthcare Businesswomen’s
   Association ‘Woman of the Year,’ is a prime example of someone who has
   gone through the revolving door between government regulatory agencies
   and the corporations they are supposed to be regulating. She was once
   the Director of the CDC before moving over to an executive position at
   Merck.

The Takeaway

   This article sheds only a small tidbit of light on the corruption that
   plagues the pharmaceutical industry. When it’s clear that the medical
   industry is not concerned about our health like it should be, it’s
   understandable why more people are choosing to take their health into
   their own hands. This does not mean that the medical industry does not
   have it’s positives, but when it comes to drugs and treatment
   specifically, a big problem exists.

Vatican Insider & Author Accuse Pope Francis of Facilitating The Sexual
Abuse, Trafficking & Death of Children

   Published

   October 1, 2019

   By
   Arjun Walia CE Staff Writer

In Brief

     * The Facts:
       Vatican insider Carlo Maria Vigano, “Titular Archbishop of Ulpiana
       Apostolic Nuncio,” has accused Pope Francis of facilitating sexual
       abuse of Children. Author and journalist Kevin Annett has done the
       same presenting some disturbing evidence.
     * Reflect On:
       How has the sexual abuse of children been allowed to carry on in
       places of high power in influence for so long? Who is exactly
       involved? Does this go all the way to the top?

   If you don’t already know, a number of Vatican officials over the years
   have been implicated in sexually abusing children. In fact, it goes
   well beyond the main church inside the walls of Vatican city, and into
   various churches around the world that are connected to the Roman
   Catholic Order, among others.

   Although there is probably much more going on behind the scenes that
   has yet to be revealed, the criminal actions of many high-ranking
   members have still come to light, with the most recent example being
   Cardinal George Pell. Pell was just convicted on five counts of child
   sexual abuse. He has now become the most senior official ever to be
   found guilty, serving as an advisor to Pope Benedict as well as Pope
   Francis. He’s one of the Vatican’s most powerful officials.

   In addition, decades worth of sexual abuse was reported in a choir led
   by the retired Pope Benedict’s brother. Approximately 600 members of a
   Catholic boys’ Domspatzen choir in Regensburg, Germany were physically
   and sexually abused from 1945 to 1992. Georg Ratzinger (Benedict’s
   brother) was the choir’s head from 1964 to 1994. In 2015, a lawyer by
   the name of Ulrich Weber was tasked with filing a report on what
   happened, and uncovered the startling fact that during the 30 years the
   choir was run by Benedict’s older brother, approximately 600 boys with
   a “high degree of plausibility” were victims of sexual and/or physical
   abuse.

   The list literally goes on and on. Not long ago, 34 Chilean Bishops
   from the Catholic Church were implicated in the sexual abuse of young
   boys. You can read more about that here.

   What’s even more disturbing is that this type of activity bleeds down
   from the Church and into Royal Families, politics, and big
   entertainment. It seems to be quite common in places of great power,
   and perhaps they’re all tied together somehow in one ‘big club.’ This
   thought used to be a ‘conspiracy theory,’ but people are now starting
   to see that it’s a fact.

   But why does this issue never get resolved? It’s an important question
   to ask. These are very powerful people who basically control the
   judicial system as well as the mainstream media. Because of their
   power, they are able to protect themselves from ‘punishment.’ Let’s use
   the Catholic Church, for example, who is headed by the Pope, a person
   who could very well have been placed there by higher authorities and is
   simply another puppet used for their power.

   Perhaps one reason this issue hasn’t been solved within the Vatican is
   because the Pope himself is involved in this type of activity. Carlo
   Maria Vigano, “Titular Archbishop of Ulpiana Apostolic Nuncio,” retired
   in 2016 after serving as the Apostolic Nuncio to the United States. He
   also previously served as Secretary-General of the Governor of Vatican
   City state from July 16th, 2009 to September 3rd, 2011.

   He recently released a bombshell 11-page written testament that offers
   information on “who in the hierarchy knew what, and when, about the
   crimes of Cardinal McCarrick.” The testimony implicates multiple
   high-ranking officials within the church including Pope Francis.
   McCarrick was recently removed from his post in June 2018 because of
   child sexual abuse allegations. This document shows how that process
   was delayed (his activities were learned of nearly two decades ago),
   and how the Pope did as much as he could to protect McCarrick.

   Why would the Pope do such a thing?

   Before we go any further, I think it’s important to mention the
   ritualistic aspect in this type of activity. Not long ago, the Pope
   compared the practice of sexually abusing a child to that of a “Satanic
   mass.” Based on our own research, we believe that this type of abuse to
   children is used in Satanic rituals. This is why it was odd when he
   said this, which also sparked a reaction from his colleague standing
   next to him.

   Manly P. Hall, one of the foremost scholars in the Occult, writes in
   his book, The Secret Teachings of All Ages:

     “By means of the secret processes of ceremonial magic it is possible
     to contact these invisible creatures and gain their help in some
     human undertaking. Good spirits willingly lend their assistance to
     any worthy enterprise, but evil spirits serve only those who live to
     pervert and destroy. . . . The most dangerous form of black magic is
     the scientific perversion of occult power for the gratification of
     personal desire.”

   This may give us a glimpse into what exactly the Pope was talking
   about. According to Malachi Martin, an Irish Catholic priest and writer
   on the Catholic Church who became a Professor of Palaeography at the
   Vatican’s Pontifical Biblical Institute:

     “Most frighteningly for [Pope] John Paul [II], he had come up
     against the irremovable presence of a malign strength in his own
     Vatican and in certain bishops’ chanceries. It was what
     knowledgeable Churchmen called the ‘superforce.’ Rumors, always
     difficult to verify, tied its installation to the beginning of Pope
     Paul VI’s reign in 1963. Indeed Paul had alluded sombrely to ‘the
     smoke of Satan which has entered the Sanctuary’. . . an oblique
     reference to an enthronement ceremony by Satanists in the Vatican.
     Besides, the incidence of Satanic pedophilia – rites and practices –
     was already documented among certain bishops and priests as widely
     dispersed as Turin, in Italy, and South Carolina, in the United
     States. The cultic acts of Satanic pedophilia are considered by
     professionals to be the culmination of the Fallen Archangel’s
     rites.”
     (Written in Hall’s book about  geopolitics and the Vatican, “The
     Keys of This Blood,” page 632)

   What about politics? The Bohemian Grove? What goes on there? Dark
   rituals like the ‘Cremation of Care’ are performed every year at
   Bohemian Grove. Whether these are real or mock sacrifices, they impact
   participants by dulling and eliminating their sense of ‘care’ and
   empathy for others and their conscience. There stands a giant owl, who
   some claim represents Moloch. Moloch is an ancient God to which,
   according to some world religions, some people sacrificed children to.
   Apparently, it was the only way to deal with the anger of this God.
   (source) You can read more about Bohemian Grove and view a picture of
   the giant owl there, here.

   Why are there Wikileaks documents that even mention Moloch being sent
   to and from Hillary Clinton? I’m not even going to get into the many
   examples within US politics, the State Department, and more that have
   been implicated in this type of activity. You can see some more
   examples in this recent article I wrote about Jeffrey Epstein.

   Researcher Kevin Annett, author of Hidden from History, The Canadian
   Holocaust has spent a lot of time researching the crimes of the church,
   especially when it comes to the treatment of the indigenous people in
   Canada. In fact, his work was how I came across the testimony of
   William Coombes, who exposed Elizabeth II for abducting multiple
   children, something he saw with his own eyes when the queen and her
   husband paid a visit to his “school.”  You can read more about that and
   watch Williams’ testimony here.

   Kevin has done some amazing work, and has a great relationship with
   many elders. He’s produced documentaries and interviewed many surviving
   elders.  He is the Secretary, The Truth Commission into Genocide in
   Canada (established September 3, 2000 in Vancouver, BC from a mandate
   arising from the IHRAAM Tribunal into Canadian Residential Schools,
   June 12-14, 1998, Vancouver). He Organized IHRAAM Tribunal into
   Canadian Residential Schools, under the auspices of the United Nations,
   June 12-14, 1998, Vancouver, and served as Advisor and authored final
   report of the Tribunal. You can view his entire biography here.

   Despite all of his accomplishments, he has been ignored, demonized, and
   touted as a “phoney” or a fraud by some on the internet. It’s
   understandable that, for anyone who has looked into his work, it’s
   quite clear that he’s not. He has faced much adversity. He is one of
   the main organizers of the  International Tribunal of Crimes of Church
   and State (ITCCS).

   The screen shots below are taken from his website, where he archives
   much of the initiatives taken by the ITCCS.

   Kevin uploaded a video to his Youtube Account a few years earlier going
   into detail about a document he and his colleagues produced. The title
   reads “Pope Francis is Named By Former Argentine junta insider as
   “prime mover” in child trafficking network.”

   This is interesting because in 1972, Chile fell to a U.S.-backed coup
   that led to the rise of a military dictatorship of General Augusto
   Pinochet. At the time, the Cardinal of Santiago, Raúl Silva
   Henríquez, took a stand against the newly-installed military
   regime, posing great risk to his own life, a move that is believed to
   have somewhat curbed the tide of political assassinations and torture
   targeting supporters of Chile’s deposed President Salvador Allende and
   other opponents of Pinochet’s rule.

   In 1976, Argentina also fell victim to a U.S.-backed coup that
   installed a military junta. However, the Catholic church’s response to
   the Videla regime could not have been more different than what had
   transpired in Chile.

   As Whitney Webb from MintPress News writes and documents:

     At the time, Pope Francis, then known by his birth name Jorge Mario
     Bergoglio, was Provincial of the Argentine Jesuits. While a handful
     of figures in the Catholic church dissented against Videla’s rule,
     Bergoglio was not one of them. In fact, Bergoglio actually aided the
     Videla regime in its murder of dissidents. Government
     documents written at the time have confirmed his role in reporting
     members of his own order who he deemed to be “leftists,” along with
     several innocent parishioners, to the military government.

   This is a somewhat corroborative look into the claims of Annett in the
   video above.

   Quite shocking and eye opening, isn’t it?

The Push For Mandatory Vaccines Is Galvanizing A Resistance Movement

   Published
   3 days ago

   on
   September 30, 2019

   By
   Richard Enos CE Staff Writer

In Brief

     * The Facts:
       Severe mandatory vaccination laws are suddenly popping up and
       getting passed in several states of late, but not without a fierce
       and growing opposition.
     * Reflect On:
       Will these mandatory vaccine laws, which are not about vaccines but
       rather about our individual sovereignty, catalyze us towards a
       greater emancipation from governmental interference and control?

   The push for mandatory vaccines seems to be gaining momentum in the
   United States. To be more precise, states are beginning to look more at
   removing exemptions which currently allow non-vaccinated children to
   attend school. As per the CDC, each individual state has vaccination
   requirements for daycare and school entry that often apply not only to
   children attending public schools, but also to those attending private
   schools and daycare facilities. All states provide medical exemptions,
   and some state laws also offer exemptions for religious and/or
   philosophical reasons. State laws also establish mechanisms for
   enforcement of school vaccination requirements and exemptions.

   Some states are in the process of attempting to remove, or have already
   removed, religious and philosophical exemptions. And in California,
   where they have already removed religious and philosophical exemptions,
   they have just passed a law that gives lawmakers, not doctors, the
   final authority of whether or not a medical exemption will be approved.

   In the latest episode of The Collective Evolution Show on CETV, Joe
   Martino and I examine the push for more stringent mandatory vaccines
   laws that are arising in several state legislatures. The clip below is
   the first segment. You can watch the full episode by signing up for a
   free 7-day trial on CETV.

California Bill SB276

   Very much in the news has been California’s Bill SB276. As mentioned,
   the new law puts medical exemptions under the authority of the
   government rather than doctors. The popular resistance to this was
   significant, and because of pressure put onto Senator Richard Pan, the
   sponsor of the bill, as well as Governor Gavin Newsome. At Newsome’s
   request, a tag-along companion Bill SB714, which made some
   concessions to protect existing medical exemptions, was also signed
   into law with the passage of SB276.

   With SB276 becoming law, a strong contingent of citizens have been
   galvanized to stay together and fight to reverse the impact of this
   bill, which, in combination with earlier changes that removed religious
   and philosophical exemptions in California, forces parents in
   California to have their children fully vaccinated if they are to go to
   public or private school. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. gave a rousing speech
   right after the bill was passed into law, and certainly gives rise to
   the belief that opposing mandatory vaccinations is the new civil rights
   movement in the United States, one which RFK Jr. underscored as ‘the
   most important battle, probably, in human history.’

Maine Bill 798

   In Maine, LD798 recently passed into law. It removes ALL philosophical
   and religious exemptions for vaccines and will potentially impact 8000
   children in the state as far as their inability to go to school until
   they are fully vaccinated. However, after the legislation passed, a
   group entitled ‘Mainers for Health and Parental Rights’ was formed and
   organized to enact a ‘People’s Veto’ on this law, described below:

     The people’s veto is a constitutional provision (Art. 4, Pt.3, §17)
     that allows the citizens of Maine, through the initiative and
     referendum process, to repeal a piece of legislation passed by the
     legislature. The people’s veto came into being as part of the
     initiative and referendum process enacted in 1909.  To repeal a
     particular piece of legislation, a petition must be presented within
     90 days of legislative adjournment and meet the signature
     requirements of any initiative proposal.  If the petition is
     certified, the law is set aside until the issue can be voted on at
     the next election.

   The requirement was that 64,000 signatures of Maine Voters (of which
   there are just over 1M in the state) needed to be collected within 90
   days of the legislation being passed. On September  16^th, the group
   presented almost 93,000 signatures to the government, which represents
   the herculean effort of getting consent from almost 10% of voters in
   the entire state! This ensured that the law would be set aside until
   elections next March, where LD798 will be on the ballot for the people
   of Maine to vote upon.

The Takeaway

   If we are to evolve, we must walk through our darkness rather than
   avoiding it. Complementing the internal work of examining our personal
   shadow, conscious activism involves the collective external
   actions that confront the darkness of humanity, where we stand firmly
   for what we believe in.

   As we work to awaken our fellow human beings to the notion that the
   government and the corporations do not work in our self-interest, the
   momentum that these movements create could not only empower us within
   the political process, but more importantly help us in stepping away
   from the current political system entirely.
