How Verizon Media and our partners bring you better ad experiences

   To give you a better overall experience, we want to provide relevant
   ads that are more useful to you. For example, when you search for a
   film, we use your search information and location to show the most
   relevant cinemas near you. We also use this information to show you ads
   for similar films you may like in the future. Like Verizon Media, our
   partners may also show you ads that they think match your interests.
