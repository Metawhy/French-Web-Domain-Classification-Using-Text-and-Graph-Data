   The UK will be leaving the EU on 31 October whatever the circumstances.
   We must respect the referendum result.

   Prorogation is a prerogative Act of the Crown, exercised on the advice
   of Ministers, to bring about the end of the parliamentary session. The
   royal prerogative is the term used to describe the powers held by
   Government Ministers, either in their own right, or through the advice
   they provide to the Queen which she is bound constitutionally to
   follow. The Government determines the length of a parliamentary session
   and advises the Queen on the date for the beginning of the next
   parliamentary session.

   The beginning of the next session is marked by the State Opening of
   Parliament during which the Queen delivers the Queen’s Speech. The
   Queen’s Speech sets out the programme of legislation the Government
   intends to pursue in the forthcoming parliamentary session.

   As the Prime Minister said in his statement on 2 September 2019, the
   Government has committed to recruiting another 20,000 police officers,
   improving both NHS and schools funding, and completing 20 new hospital
   upgrades. It is to progress the Government’s agenda on these and many
   other fronts that the Prime Minister has sought to commence a new
   session of Parliament in October.

   Parliament is only dissolved before a General Election. Dissolution
   brings an end to a Parliament. The effect of a dissolution is all
   business comes to an end and every seat in the House of Commons is
   vacated until a General Election is held.
   Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, General Elections are now
   automatically held every five years and the next general election is
   scheduled for May 2022. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act removed the
   prerogative power to dissolve Parliament; no longer can the Prime
   Minister advise the sovereign to dissolve Parliament and call a General
   Election.

   The Fixed-term Parliaments Act also provides the basis on which an
   early General Election can be triggered:

   1. If a motion for an early general election is agreed either by at
   least two-thirds of the whole House of Commons or without a vote; or

   2. If a motion of ‘no confidence’, in the terms set out in the
   Fixed-term Parliaments Act, is passed and no subsequent motion
   expressing confidence in Her Majesty’s Government is passed by the
   Commons within 14 days.

   In the event of an early-general election, the Fixed-term Parliaments
   Act allows the Prime Minister to recommend a suitable polling day to
   the Queen. There will be a Royal Proclamation to set the date.
   Parliament is then automatically dissolved 25 working days before
   polling day.

   The Government would prefer to leave the EU with a deal and will work
   in an energetic and determined way to get a better deal. The Government
   is very willing to sit down with the Commission and EU Member States to
   talk about what needs to be done to achieve that.

   The Prime Minister has said an election needs to take place ahead of
   the European Council on 17 to 18 October. This would allow the Prime
   Minister to go to the European Council with a clear mandate from the
   British people to deliver the referendum result.
