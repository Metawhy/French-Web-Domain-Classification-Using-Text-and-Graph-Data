SHIPPING INFORMATION

   usa USA

   We do not deliver to Hawaii and Alaska.

   » Go to shipping costs

STANDARD SHIPPING

   Standard shipping takes approx. 2 to 5 working days. The duration of
   shipping depends on the ZIP code of the shipping address. If you like
   to know the exact duration of shipping, please enter your ZIP code on
   the product page in our online shop.

   Parcel deliveries are provided by a parcel service provider from Monday
   through Friday.

   Please note that our shipping carrier does not deliver to post office
   boxes or parcel lockers.

GROUP SHIPMENT

   We avoid keeping different items from different production lines
   waiting for each other in our shipping department. Once a finished item
   arrives in our in-house shipping department, it is immediately
   processed. Combined shipment is therefore not possible.

                            Basic Smart Pro
   Resolution

   Depending on the printed product, the artwork must have a minimum
   resolution of usually 300�dpi (120�dpi for many large formats). Our
   BASIC check will alert you to an insufficient resolution when you
   upload the files.
   Page dimensions

   We check whether the artwork format corresponds to the dimensions of
   the printed product.
   Font embedding

   We check by default whether all fonts are embedded or are alternatively
   converted to paths, otherwise we are unable to print the artwork.
   Bleed

   The bleed aims to compensate for slight trimming tolerances in
   post-press. Bleed ensures that no unprinted white edges occur in the
   final result.
   Colour mode

   For optimum colour reproduction and to avoid variations, your artwork
   should be created in CMYK colour mode.
   Colour application

   Only a certain amount of ink may be applied depending on the paper and
   the print process. We check whether the maximum ink application is
   exceeded for this order.
   Spot finishes

   Frequent error sources: Spot finishes have been created incorrectly or
   named improperly in the artwork. This option ensures that all settings
   are correct.
   Outlines

   When you choose this option, we will check whether die lines, milling
   contours and other outlines have been created correctly in the artwork.
   This prevents costly reprinting.
   Text direction

   It is annoying when the text direction in your flyer is suddenly
   vertical. Choose this option to avoid this and similar problems.
   Folding type and creases

   The different folding types can be challenging even for experienced
   users. The data check verifies whether the folding type and the creases
   in the artwork correspond to the ordered product.
   Spot colours

   An additional check to ensure that spot colours and special colours
   have been named properly and created correctly in the artwork.
   Safety margin to the edge

   We check whether there is sufficient distance to the edge. This
   prevents individual elements from being cut off.
   Page count

   We check whether your artwork contains all pages and whether this
   corresponds to the ordered product. This is recommended for folded
   leaflets, brochures and catalogues in particular.

                            Basic Smart Pro
   Resolution

   Depending on the printed product, the artwork must have a minimum
   resolution of usually 300�dpi (120�dpi for many large formats). Our
   BASIC check will alert you to an insufficient resolution when you
   upload the files.
   Page dimensions

   We check whether the artwork format corresponds to the dimensions of
   the printed product.
   Font embedding

   We check by default whether all fonts are embedded or are alternatively
   converted to paths, otherwise we are unable to print the artwork.
   Bleed

   The bleed aims to compensate for slight trimming tolerances in
   post-press. Bleed ensures that no unprinted white edges occur in the
   final result.
   Colour mode

   For optimum colour reproduction and to avoid variations, your artwork
   should be created in CMYK colour mode.
   Colour application

   Only a certain amount of ink may be applied depending on the paper and
   the print process. We check whether the maximum ink application is
   exceeded for this order.
   Spot finishes

   Frequent error sources: Spot finishes have been created incorrectly or
   named improperly in the artwork. This option ensures that all settings
   are correct.
   Outlines

   When you choose this option, we will check whether die lines, milling
   contours and other outlines have been created correctly in the artwork.
   This prevents costly reprinting.
   Text direction

   It is annoying when the text direction in your flyer is suddenly
   vertical. Choose this option to avoid this and similar problems.
   Folding type and creases

   The different folding types can be challenging even for experienced
   users. The data check verifies whether the folding type and the creases
   in the artwork correspond to the ordered product.
   Spot colours

   An additional check to ensure that spot colours and special colours
   have been named properly and created correctly in the artwork.
   Safety margin to the edge

   We check whether there is sufficient distance to the edge. This
   prevents individual elements from being cut off.
   Page count

   We check whether your artwork contains all pages and whether this
   corresponds to the ordered product. This is recommended for folded
   leaflets, brochures and catalogues in particular.
