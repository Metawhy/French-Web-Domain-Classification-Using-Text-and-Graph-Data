   Polarities in Human Development

Polarities in Human Development

   Beena Sharma   September 30, 2019
   Beena Sharma and Corey deVos explore the important relationship between
   polarities and adult development — and how polarity thinking not only
   helps accelerate our development toward integral stages of maturity,
   but also helps us to be more of ourselves, wherever we happen to be in
   our developmental trajectory.

   The Great Release

The Great Release

   Robb Smith   March 23, 2017
   Rising populism and the election of President Trump are symptoms of
   massive irresilience that has been building in the U.S.-led world state
   since 1945, and may reflect the end of the fourth cycle of economic
   hegemony of the past 800 years. The Great Recession of 2008 was just a
   tremor. We wind toward a coming global breakdown, a great release that
   threatens regression across our lives.

Who Is Ken Wilber?

   Often referred to as the "Einstein of consciousness studies", Ken
   Wilber is a preeminent scholar of the Integral stage of human
   development. He is the originator of the world's first truly
   comprehensive or integrative philosophy, aptly named “Integral Theory”
   — something that is becoming increasingly necessary in order to
   navigate and thrive in today’s world.
   “I have one major rule: Everybody is right. More specifically,
   everybody — including me — has some important pieces of truth, and all
   of those pieces need to be honored, cherished, and included in a more
   gracious, spacious, and compassionate embrace.”

   The Many Ways We Touch

The Many Ways We Touch

   Ken Wilber
   We have the intuition that everyone is at least partially right, that
   no human being is capable of being 100% wrong. But how do you tell just
   how right everyone is? Some are more right than others — how do you
   tell the difference? And how do you handle interfacing with limited or
   partial perspectives when engaging with people in real time? This
   eBook, from the upcoming Vol. II of Ken Wilber's "Kosmos Trilogy", will
   help.

   The Four Faces of Truth

The Four Faces of Truth

   Ken Wilber
   In an era when our collective notion of “truth” is being weaponized,
   balkanized, and smashed to smithereens, it’s important to remind
   ourselves how we go about discerning truth in the first place. In this
   introductory chapter from The Eye of Spirit, Ken Wilber explores the
   four primary methods we use to acquire and verify our knowledge,
   allowing us to escape our current “post-truth” quagmire by bridging the
   ever-widening divide between conflicting views, values, and verities.

   Populism is on the rise. Too many people feel left out of the march of

   see their kids better off than they are today. The rich get richer
   while the middle class remains stagnant. There is a growing and robust

   Beauty and the Expansion of Women’s Identity

Beauty and the Expansion of Women’s Identity

   Vanessa Fisher
   The history of women’s beauty is written in bodily gestures that
   express both the constraints of their culture as well as the unfolding
   desire of their interiority. Embracing the power of beauty has always
   been problematic for feminism, and for good reason. This article offers
   an integrative analysis of the current views that dominate feminist
   discourse on women’s beauty, as well as a personal story of Vanessa's
   own ongoing journey as a young woman trying to reclaim her beauty for
   the benefit of all beings.
