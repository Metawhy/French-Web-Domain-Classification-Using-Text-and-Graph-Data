   [MFT_Countdown2.jpg]
   Hello MFT Friends!  We are at countdown day 2 which means 2 days left
   until this amazing new release of MFT stamps and dies.  MFT has so many
   AMAZING sets for this holiday release.  Today's stamp has my clean and
   simple heart going pitter patter!  One stamp, one card base and done!
   Check it out!
   MFT October Release
   To create this card, I lined the image up in my Misti and then did an
   ombre blend with 2 greens for the tree.  I added in a bright yellow ink
   for the star and then topped it all off with some Red Stickles.  Super
   easy, super fast and perfect for mass producing!
   MFT October Release
   The MFT Blog will have a list of places to stop to see more of today's
   countdown goodness.  See you back tomorrow for Day 1!
   Have a great day!

MFT October Release Countdown Day 3...

   [MFT_Countdown3.jpg]
   Only 3 days left until Release day at MFT!  The October stamps and dies
   are so amazing.  My clean and simple card making brain is SO happy this
   month with all the dies and solid images.  Check out this die.....
   MFT October Release
   First, I stenciled the card base with the Joy Love Peace Stencil and
   then adding in the die cuts.  I did the whole thing in black cardstock
   and then added in the colored elements.

   I added a layer of fun foam so those sentiment would stand out from the
   card base.  Super easy!

   [MFT_Countdown4.jpg]
   We are counting down the days until Release Day at MFT and today makes
   4 more days!  This Christmas Release is amazing.  There are so many
   things to create your Christmas cards and there is still SO much more
   to see.  Today I am share 2 new products....Peace on Earth Stamp Set
   and Peace on Earth Dies.  Love the clean and simple possibilities with
   these dies!
   MFT October Release
   To create this card, I stamped the new Peach on Earth sentiment in
   MFT's Bluberry ink.  I love this bold blue and it works so well with
   this sentiment.
   MFT October Release
   Next, I die cut the dove and the olive branch in white cardstock.  I
   added in some color to the branch with Copic markers.  I popped these
   up on foam tape for some dimension.  Last, I added some glitter gel pen
   to the letters and then added some strips of gel pen at the top and
   bottom of the card front. You gotta have a little sparkle!  :)

   CARDS
   There are many elements in this kit that you could make TONS of cards!
    I have 4 to share today and I didn't even make a dent in the box.
   Here is the first card that used the ADORABLE dies included in the
   kit....
   IM Spellbinders_8810
   I die cut all the piece of the little car and tree and then added it to
   one of the little patterned paper cards in the kit.  The sentiment is a
   sticker set that was so easy to add in.
   Spellbinders
   You will get a 40 sheets of 6x6 pattern paper in a pack.  I used one of
   them for the background of this card...
   Spellbinders
   Using the full set of glitter foam stickers, I added in the sentiment
   and a paper star.  Super simple!
   Spellbinders
   This Santa card combines several of the kit elements....
   Spellbinders
   Note card, die cuts, clear sentiment stickers and gems, along with a
   patterned paper background.
   Spellbinders
   And I had to do one SUPER simple card....
   Spellbinders
   This card base is covered in a piece of gray paper from the paper pack.
    Then I took this adorable element and added it to the center of the
   card.  So quick and easy but still so many fun details in the little
   envelope!
   Spellbinders
   This kit is an amazing buy!  You can get so many Christmas cards done
   in one sitting with everything at your finger tips.  The kit comes with
   foam adhesive and twine too!  All the finished details are there.
   I hope you enjoyed today's card.  Check out the Spellbinders Merry

MFT October Release Countdown Day 5...

   [MFT_Countdown5_July2018.jpg]
   Hello MFT Friends!  I am so excited for this months MFT Release.  There
   are LOTS of stamps and dies that are so perfect for my clean and simple
   ways.  I am one happy camper and I can't wait to share it all with you.
    We are counting down to release day and today is day 5.  Stay tuned
   each of the next 4 days where all of us on the Design Team will have
   lots to share!
   You may remember the amazing Happy Birthday Blend stamp set.....well
   now we have a Christmas version!  Merry Christmas Blend!
   MFT October Release
   I kept this card super clean and simple with a scored white cardstock
   base.  First, I die cut white cardstock and lined it up in my Misti.
   Using my Misti, I stamped the first round of letters with red ink and
   the second round with pink. It was super easy to line up by die cutting
   first.
   MFT October Release
   I attached the sentiment onto the card base with fun foam and then
   added an adorable little tree die....stay tuned....to the card.  Easy
   peasy!
   MFT October Release
   Head on over to the MFT Blog to see LOTS more Countdown Inspiration.
