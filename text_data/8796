About CANCER TODAY

   CANCER TODAY provides a suite of data visualization tools to explore
   estimates of the incidence, mortality, and prevalence of 36 specific
   cancer types and of all cancer sites combined in 185 countries or
   territories of the world in 2018, by sex and age group, as part of the
   GLOBOCAN project. Please note that:
     * These estimates are based on the most recent data available to IARC
       through collaborations with population-based cancer registries (the
       International Association of Cancer Registries) and with the World
       Health Organization, or are based on information publicly available
       online.
     * Because the data sources are continually improving in terms of the
       quality and availability of data, changes in methodology are
       sometimes desirable, and as a result the estimates may not be
       comparable over time. Therefore, considerable caution should be
       exercised when interpreting the current estimates in comparison
       with those published in previous versions of GLOBOCAN.
     * CANCER TODAY is under continual development, as we seek new and
       better ways to present global cancer burden data. To cite this
       website or the underlying data sources, click here.

About CSU

   The main focus of IARC’s Section of Cancer Surveillance (CSU) is the
   ongoing analysis of global cancer data and the development of
   statistics for cancer control action, in keeping with one of the
   primary aims of IARC: to describe and elucidate cancer occurrence
   worldwide. The Section coordinates the collection, analysis,
   interpretation, and dissemination of indicators that capture the
   changing magnitude and profile of cancer by means of three essential
   and complementary areas of activity:
     * cancer registry support and development
     * estimation and provision of global cancer indicators
     * descriptive epidemiological cancer research.

Our research

   IARC’s Section of Cancer Surveillance (CSU) compiles, analyses,
   interprets, and disseminates data on global cancer indicators to
   document the changing scale, epidemiological profile, and impact of the
   disease. The Section publishes a wide range of international research
   papers examining the descriptive epidemiology of cancer. CSU also works
   alongside national staff to improve the local data quality, registry
   coverage, and analytical capacity of population-based cancer
   registries. You can read more about the work of CSU at the IARC website
   (http://www.iarc.fr/en/research-groups/sec1/index.php).

Fact sheets

   For a quick access to a summary of the burden of cancer in a country or
   for a cancer, use the fact sheets pages. Fact Sheets are a collection
   of statistical summaries for the eight most common cancer types or for
   each country or region of the world. They were developed to provide a
   quick overview of frequently-requested cancer incidence, mortality and
   prevalence statistics.

   Cancer registry data are essential for global and national cancer
   control planning. Close cooperation with population-based cancer
   registries (PBCRs) around the world is an essential aspect of our work,
   and IARC’s Section of Cancer Surveillance (CSU) serves as the
   Secretariat for the International Association of Cancer Registries
   (IACR), working closely with this umbrella organization as well as with
   individual registries on collaborative projects, including Cancer
   Incidence in Five Continents (CI5).

   The International Association of Cancer Registries (IACR) is a
   professional society of population-based cancer registries. IACR’s 500
   member registries are at the forefront of the development and
   application of cancer registration to inform local cancer control
   approaches and to build cancer research opportunities. You can read
   more about the IACR at the association’s website
   (http://www.iacr.com.fr/).

   The Global Initiative for Cancer Registry Development (GICR) is a
   partnership based on a commitment from key international organizations
   to address inequities by helping underserved countries prevent cancer
   and improve outcomes. Coordinated by IARC, the GICR is the first global
   strategy for strengthening the ability to collect, analyse, and
   disseminate cancer data. You can read more about the GICR at the
   initiative’s website (http://gicr.iarc.fr).

Availability

   An alphanumeric scoring system, shown below, is used to independently
   describe the availability of incidence and mortality data at the
   country level. The combined score is presented together with the
   estimates for each country, to provide a broad indication of the
   robustness of the estimation.

Incidence data

     * A. High-quality* national data or high-quality regional data
       (coverage: > 50%)
     * B. High-quality* regional data (coverage: 10–50%)
     * B. High-quality* regional data (coverage: 10–50%)
     * D. National data (rates).
     * E. Regional data (rates).
     * F. Frequency data.
     * G. No data.

   *Data included in Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (CI5), Volume
   IX^a and/or X^b.

Mortality data

   National statistics are collated and made available by the World Health
   Organization for countries with vital registration systems.
     * A. High-quality* complete vital registration data
     * B. Medium-quality* complete vital registration data
     * C. Low-quality* complete vital registration data
     * D. Incomplete or sample vital registration data
     * E. Data from other sources (cancer registries, verbal autopsy
       surveys, etc.)
     * F. No data

   (2005). Counting the dead and what they died from: an assessment of the
   global status of cause of death data. Bulletin of the World Health
   Organization. 83(3):161–240.

METHODS

   The methods of estimation are country-specific, and the quality of each
   estimation depends on the quality and amount of the information
   available that each country.

   In theory, there are as many methods as countries, and because of the
   variety and complexity of these methods, an overall quality score for
   the incidence and mortality estimates combined is almost impossible to
   determine.

Incidence

   The methods used to estimate the sex- and age-specific incidence rates
   of cancer in a specific country fall into the following broad
   categories, in order of priority:

     * Rates projected to 2012 (38 countries)
     * Most recent rates available applied to the 2012 population (20
       countries)
     * Estimated from national mortality data by modelling, using
       incidence mortality ratios derived from data recorded by
       country-specific cancer registries (13 countries)
     * Estimated from national mortality estimates by modelling, using
       incidence mortality ratios derived from data recorded by local
       cancer registries in neighbouring countries (9 European countries)
     * Estimated from national mortality estimates using modelled survival
       (32 countries)
     * Estimated as a weighted average of local rates (16 countries)
     * Estimated using the data from one cancer registry covering part of
       the country, which are treated as representative of the countrywide
       profile (11 countries)
     * Age/sex specific rates for all cancers combined were partitioned
       using data on the relative frequency of individual cancers, by age
       and sex (12 countries)
     * The rates are those of neighbouring countries or registries in the
       same area (33 countries)

Mortality

   Depending of the degree of detail and the accuracy of the national
   mortality data, one of the following six methods was used, in order of
   priority:

     * Rates projected to 2012 (69 countries)
     * Most recent rates available applied to the 2012 population (26
       countries)
     * Estimated as a weighted average of regional rates (1 country)
     * Estimated from national incidence estimates by modelling, using
       country-specific survival (2 countries)
     * Estimated from national incidence estimates by modelling, using
       country-specific survival (2 countries)
     * The rates are those of neighbouring countries or registries in the
       same area (3 countries)

   The sources and methods used to estimate the global incidence and
   mortality in 2012, in addition to a brief description of the key
   results by cancer site and in 20 large areas of the world, can be found
   in Ferlay et al. (2015)^a. A further assessment of the methods has also
   been described by Antoni et al. (2016)^b.

Prevalence

   The sex- and cancer-specific 1-, 3-, and 5-year prevalence estimates
   for 2012 were computed by multiplying the corresponding estimates for
   2008^c by the ratios of the estimated number of incident cases in 2012
   in the adult population to the corresponding estimated number of cases
   for 2008.
