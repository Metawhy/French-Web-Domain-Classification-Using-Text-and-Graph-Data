The immersive programming experience

   Pharo is a pure object-oriented programming language and a powerful
   environment, focused on simplicity and immediate feedback (think IDE
   and OS rolled into one).

A glimpse of Pharo

$ wget -O- https://get.pharo.org/64 | bash
$ ./pharo Pharo.image eval "42 factorial"

Teaser

     * Simple & powerful language: No constructors, no types declaration,
       no interfaces, no primitive types. Yet a powerful and elegant
       language with a full syntax fitting in one postcard! Pharo is
       objects and messages all the way down.

     * Live, immersive environment: Immediate feedback at any moment of
       your development: Developing, testing, debugging. Even in
       production environments, you will never be stuck in compiling and
       deploying steps again!

     * Amazing debugging experience: The Pharo environment includes a
       debugger unlike anything you've seen before. It allows you to step
       through code, restart the execution of methods, create methods on
       the fly, and much more!

     * Pharo is yours: Pharo is made by an incredible community, with more
       than 100 contributors for the last revision of the platform and
       hundreds of people contributing constantly with frameworks and
       libraries.

     * Fully open-source: Pharo full stack is released under MIT License.

   Made with love by Nico, Esteban and Damien @RMoD. The design was kindly
