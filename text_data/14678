What To Expect From XXXTentacion's Second Posthumous Album

   XXXTentacion

   A little over a year after XXXTentacion (born Jahseh Onfroy) was shot
   and killed outside a Florida motorcycle dealership, his second
   posthumous album, Bad Vibes Forever, will be released this fall. X’s
   manager and Sounds Music Group CEO Solomon Sobande describes it as “the
   love child between 17 and ?,” the two albums X released during his
   lifetime. Along with Nima Etminan, vp at EMPIRE (which releases X’s
   music), he spoke about assembling Bad Vibes and the artist’s complex
   legacy.

   How did you approach putting the album together?

   Sobande: A lot of records, like “School Shooter” featuring Lil Wayne or
   “Hearteater,” Jahseh saved for this point in his career when he was
   more established, so they would be better received. A lot of things he
   had worked on, almost complete ideas, weren’t finished -- maybe [they]
   only had one verse and a hook or only a beat. To fill out those songs,
   a who’s who of the music industry came out to help us.

   Who did that include?

   Sobande: The executive producer is Cleopatra Bernard, Jahseh’s mother,
   who pieced everything together with the creatives who worked with
   Jahseh. John Cunningham, Jah’s right-hand man, produced the majority of
   the album. There’s outside production from DJ Carnage and JonFX. For
   “Royalty,” featuring Ky-Mani Marley, Stefflon Don and Vybz Kartel, Jah
   did the song with Ky-Mani, and after he passed, his mom set it up so I
   could go to Jamaica, visit Vybz in jail and get his verse.

   Are there other features?

   Sobande: There’s a healthy amount. Tory Lanez and Mavado; there’s a
   country song featuring Lil Nas X. One of the most surprising is
   Blink-182 -- one of Jah’s favorite bands.

   Did his mother have final approval?

   Etminan: His mother’s word remains the most important thing, along with
   the people who worked most closely with him. I was a young hip-hop fan
   when 2Pac passed away. I remember 2Pac albums coming out and being
   upset about people who had no relation to him being put on records. So
   now that I’m working on a project for someone who was taken away from
   us too early, I want to make sure I satisfy the kids in the position I
   was in.

   The domestic violence charges against X heavily inform his legacy. How
   does that influence you?

   Sobande: I knew him personally, and he wasn’t the person those charges
   said he was. He had his share of problems, mental health issues. But he
   was making every effort to change. Part of the responsibility for me
   and his team is to expose that person who was trying to be better.

Universal Music Chairman Lucian Grainge Knighted By Prince William

   Sir Lucian Grainge is made a Knight Bachelor of the British Empire by
   the Duke of Cambridge at Buckingham Palace in London.

   Universal Music Group chairman and CEO Lucian Grainge was honored on
   Tuesday during a ceremony at Buckingham Palace in London. Prince
   William, the Duke of Cambridge, donned his knightly sword and
   inaugurated Sir Lucian's appointment to the Order of the British Empire
   and Knight Bachelor for his accomplishments in the music business.

   The knighthood was first announced in June as part of Queen Elizabeth
   II's 90th birthday honors. "It is with enormous pride that I receive
   this honor from Her Majesty the Queen," he said at the time. "It is a
   recognition of British music's significance to the U.K.'s culture and
   economy, its role in inspiring investment, and the contribution of
   incredible creative talent from around the world." [readmore:6874748]

   UMG, owned by Vivendi, is having a good year. In the first nine months,
   UMG revenues were up 3.8 percent to $4 billion, with streaming alone
   accounting for a quarter of that. Grainge, a former A&R executive who
   worked with acts from Eurythmics to Amy Winehouse, was recognized as
   the top executive on this year's Billboard Power 100 list.

What To Expect From XXXTentacion's Second Posthumous Album

   XXXTentacion

   A little over a year after XXXTentacion (born Jahseh Onfroy) was shot
   and killed outside a Florida motorcycle dealership, his second
   posthumous album, Bad Vibes Forever, will be released this fall. X’s
   manager and Sounds Music Group CEO Solomon Sobande describes it as “the
   love child between 17 and ?,” the two albums X released during his
   lifetime. Along with Nima Etminan, vp at EMPIRE (which releases X’s
   music), he spoke about assembling Bad Vibes and the artist’s complex
   legacy.

   How did you approach putting the album together?

   Sobande: A lot of records, like “School Shooter” featuring Lil Wayne or
   “Hearteater,” Jahseh saved for this point in his career when he was
   more established, so they would be better received. A lot of things he
   had worked on, almost complete ideas, weren’t finished -- maybe [they]
   only had one verse and a hook or only a beat. To fill out those songs,
   a who’s who of the music industry came out to help us.

   Who did that include?

   Sobande: The executive producer is Cleopatra Bernard, Jahseh’s mother,
   who pieced everything together with the creatives who worked with
   Jahseh. John Cunningham, Jah’s right-hand man, produced the majority of
   the album. There’s outside production from DJ Carnage and JonFX. For
   “Royalty,” featuring Ky-Mani Marley, Stefflon Don and Vybz Kartel, Jah
   did the song with Ky-Mani, and after he passed, his mom set it up so I
   could go to Jamaica, visit Vybz in jail and get his verse.

   Are there other features?

   Sobande: There’s a healthy amount. Tory Lanez and Mavado; there’s a
   country song featuring Lil Nas X. One of the most surprising is
   Blink-182 -- one of Jah’s favorite bands.

   Did his mother have final approval?

   Etminan: His mother’s word remains the most important thing, along with
   the people who worked most closely with him. I was a young hip-hop fan
   when 2Pac passed away. I remember 2Pac albums coming out and being
   upset about people who had no relation to him being put on records. So
   now that I’m working on a project for someone who was taken away from
   us too early, I want to make sure I satisfy the kids in the position I
   was in.

   The domestic violence charges against X heavily inform his legacy. How
   does that influence you?

   Sobande: I knew him personally, and he wasn’t the person those charges
   said he was. He had his share of problems, mental health issues. But he
   was making every effort to change. Part of the responsibility for me
   and his team is to expose that person who was trying to be better.

Universal Music Chairman Lucian Grainge Knighted By Prince William

   Sir Lucian Grainge is made a Knight Bachelor of the British Empire by
   the Duke of Cambridge at Buckingham Palace in London.

   Universal Music Group chairman and CEO Lucian Grainge was honored on
   Tuesday during a ceremony at Buckingham Palace in London. Prince
   William, the Duke of Cambridge, donned his knightly sword and
   inaugurated Sir Lucian's appointment to the Order of the British Empire
   and Knight Bachelor for his accomplishments in the music business.

   The knighthood was first announced in June as part of Queen Elizabeth
   II's 90th birthday honors. "It is with enormous pride that I receive
   this honor from Her Majesty the Queen," he said at the time. "It is a
   recognition of British music's significance to the U.K.'s culture and
   economy, its role in inspiring investment, and the contribution of
   incredible creative talent from around the world." [readmore:6874748]

   UMG, owned by Vivendi, is having a good year. In the first nine months,
   UMG revenues were up 3.8 percent to $4 billion, with streaming alone
   accounting for a quarter of that. Grainge, a former A&R executive who
   worked with acts from Eurythmics to Amy Winehouse, was recognized as
   the top executive on this year's Billboard Power 100 list.

Rosalía Says She Feels 'Very Grateful' Representing Where She Comes From at
2019 VMAs: Watch

   8/27/2019 by Rebecca Schiller

   Rosalía stopped to chat with Billboard’s Jordyn Rolling on the red
   carpet at the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards on Monday (Aug. 26) to
   discuss her excitement over performing at the event and why it means so
   much for her to be representing where she comes from.

   The singer, who was nominated for three VMAs and took home the prize
   for best Latin music video with “Con Altura” with J Balvin and El
   Guincho, also took to the stage to perform alongside Ozuna later on in
   the evening.

   Speaking with Billboard ahead of the performance, Rosalía said, “I’m so
   excited to be here today performing because I will be performing aside
   a lot of artists that I admire a lot, so I can’t wait.”

   Asked how it feels to be at the event with other Latin artists such as
   Ozuna, Bad Bunny, and J Balvin, Rosalía notes that she feels “very
   grateful” and that coming from Barcelona, she is happy to be
   representing where she comes from.

   “We are here and it’s amazing that we can sing in Spanish in a place
   like that, it’s magic,” she adds.

   You can check out the full video interview with Rosalía above, and
   watch her VMAs performance below.
