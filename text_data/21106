   On Token Velocity

   Basic Attention Token radically improves the efficiency of digital
   advertising by creating a new token that can be exchanged
   between publishers, advertisers, and users. It all happens on the
   Ethereum blockchain.

   The token can be used to obtain a variety of advertising and
   attention-based services on the BAT platform. The utility of the token
   is based on user attention, which simply means a person’s focused
   mental engagement.

The Challenge

   Digital advertising is overrun by middlemen, trackers and fraud.
   Users are abused
     * Up to 50% of the average user’s mobile data is for ads and
       trackers, costing as much as $23 a month.
     * Ads use about 5 seconds of mobile load time on average.
     * Ads decrease phone battery life by as much as 21%.
     * Privacy is violated when large media sites host up to 70 trackers.
     * Malware (malvertisements, ransom-ware) is up 132% in one year.

   Publishers are hurting
     * Google and Facebook take 73% of all ad dollars and 99% of all
       growth.
     * Revenue is recently down 66%.
     * Bots inflicted $7.2 billion in fraud last year.
     * Over 600 million phones and desktops run ad-blocking.
     * Publishers cannot seamlessly monetize value added services.

   Advertisers are losing
     * Advertisers lack good information on what they are paying for.
     * Marketers are often fooled by bogus websites and bots that commit
       fraud.
     * Targeting is poor, making users more likely to ignore ads.

   Blockchain Digital Advertising

   Introducing a decentralized, transparent digital ad exchange based on
   Ethereum Blockchain.

   Stage 1: Brave Browser

   Brave is a fast, open source, privacy-focused browser that blocks
   malvertisements, trackers, and contains a ledger system that
   anonymously captures user attention to accurately reward publishers.
   Stage 2: Basic Attention Token

   The Basic Attention Token can be used to obtain a variety of
   advertising and attention-based services on the BAT platform, as it is
   exchanged between publishers, advertisers, and users.

   The token’s utility is derived from — or denominated by — user
   attention.

   Attention is really just focused mental engagement — on an
   advertisement, in this case.

   Stages 1 + 2 = A New Deal

   The Brave browser knows where users spend their time, making it the
   perfect tool to calculate and reward publishers with BATs. This service
   creates a transparent and efficient Blockchain-based digital
   advertising market. Publishers receive more revenue because middlemen
   and fraud are reduced. Users opt-in to an inclusive and rewarding
   private ad experience. And advertisers get better data on their
   spending.
   How It Works

   The Brave browser anonymously monitors user attention, then rewards
   publishers accordingly with BATs.

   Measuring Attention

   Attention is measured as users view ads and content in the browser’s
   active tab in real time. The Attention Value for the ad will be
   calculated based on incremental duration and pixels in view in
   proportion to relevant content, prior to any direct engagement with the
   ad. We will define further anonymous cost-per-action models as the
   system develops.

   Ads are then anonymously matched with customer interests using local
   machine learning algorithms. This means fewer irrelevant ads.
   Brave will work with publishers and advertisers to establish best
   practices for judging user attention. One potential metric: the number
   of total views of advertising content for a certain number of seconds.
   Or, points assigned on the length of a view.

   Who Gets What?

   Users viewing ads will be rewarded with BATs. BATs can be used
   for premium content or services on the BAT platform.

   Publishers will, as part of this service, receive the lion’s share of
   the total ad revenue. We anticipate that users will also donate back
   some tokens to publishers, further increasing their revenue.

   More Privacy, Less Fraud

   We plan to mitigate possible ad fraud through the use of cryptography,
   better client-side integrity, and transparency achieved through open
   source.

   Up and Running

   Much of the infrastructure required to deploy BAT at the back end is up
   and running, meaning it’s currently in place and being used to
   distribute donations to publishers based on customer attention. Use it
   today in the Brave Browser for Windows, Mac OS and Linux.

Digital advertising is broken.

It is a market filled with middlemen and fraudsters, hurting users,
publishers and advertisers.

   The Basic Attention Token (BAT) was developed to address this. BAT, an
   ERC20 token built on top of Ethereum, will be the token of utility in a
   new, decentralized, open source and efficient blockchain-based digital
   advertising platform.

   In the ecosystem, advertisers will give publishers BATs based on the
   measured attention of users. Users will also receive some BATs for
   participating. They can donate them back to publishers or use them on
   the platform.

   This transparent system keeps user data private while delivering fewer
   but more relevant ads. Publishers experience less fraud while
   increasing their percentage of rewards. And advertisers get better
   reporting and performance.

   The first part of the solution, the Brave browser, is already
   operational. Brave is a fast, open source, privacy-focused browser that
   blocks ads and trackers, and contains a ledger system that anonymously
   measures user attention aggregate to accurately reward publishers.

   Download Brave now and experience the first phase of the BAT ecosystem
   through Brave’s publisher contribution solution.
