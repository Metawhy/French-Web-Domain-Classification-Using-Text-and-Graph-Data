What our customers are saying:

     This shop gets an A+. I have purchased from this seller for years.
     Never unhappy, always pleasantly surprised.

     The typewriter is beautiful. It’s in perfect condition and I’ve used
     it every day since I got it. It helps me focus and I don’t find
     myself taking the breaks I normally do when I write on my computer.
     It’s pretty great

     The typewriter is in excellent working condition, just as described!
     Shipping was fast and it was carefully packed and included a user
     guide! Great communication throughout. Excellent buying experience!!

     Typewriter came in very good condition and in good time packed
     beautifully, I like that and am very well pleased, thank you for
     sellers who care.
