   The Impossible Burger is about 25% higher in protein. But there are
   also some important differences in where the protein comes from. The
   Impossible Burger gets its protein from wheat and potato. It also
   contains a small amount of soy. The Beyond Burger, on the other hand,
   is made from pea protein. For those who are sensitive to wheat and/or
   soy, the advantage clearly goes to the Beyond Burger.

   However, pea protein can have different consequences. It’s somewhat
   notorious for producing a lot of gas, particularly if you’re not used
   to eating it. So, you might not want to try the Beyond Burger for the
   first time when on a first date.

How Do They Compare in Taste?

   Both of these products do a great job mimicking the appearance and
   texture of real ground beef. In terms of flavor, this is a subjective
   judgment but I think the Impossible Burger comes much closer to the
   taste of beef, probably due to the heme iron.

   For those who are sensitive to wheat and/or soy, the advantage clearly
   goes to the Beyond Burger. However, pea protein can have different
   consequences.

   Although the Beyond Burger doesn’t taste beany in any way, I found it a
   little more bland than the Impossible Burger. But I would find either
   one of these perfectly enjoyable at a backyard barbecue or burger
   joint.

   At the time of this writing, the Beyond Burger is the only one that’s
   available in your local grocery store. The Impossible Burger is only
   available in restaurants.

Is Fake Meat Too Processed to be Healthy?

   As Kate alluded to in her question, neither of these products could be
   considered a minimally processed food. A lot of manipulation has gone
   into transforming peas and potatoes into something that looks and
   tastes an awful lot like a hamburger.

   The Impossible Burger gets credit for having a slightly shorter and
   somewhat more recognizable ingredient list. But if your goal is to eat
   more whole and minimally-processed foods, both of these burgers would
   probably belong in the category of something that you’d enjoy
   occasionally but not as a daily staple.

   On the other hand, if your goal is to eat less meat and more
   plant-based protein, you might decide that more has been gained than
   lost here. I don't think all processed foods can be lumped into the
   same nefarious category. Processing can strip away nutrients, and it's
   often used to turn cheap ingredients into hyper-palatable junk food.
   But processing can also sometimes improve the nutritional profile of a
   food or serve other noble purposes, such as reducing food waste or, in
   this case, reducing beef consumption.

   What's your take? Have you tried the Beyond Burger? Do beefless burgers
   have a place in your diet? Why or why not? Post your thoughts below or

   beyond burger patty

   A couple of weeks ago, I wrote about a new meat alternative called the
   Impossible Burger and how it compares with real beef. Almost
   immediately, I started getting emails from listeners wanting to know
   how the Impossible Burger compared with another meatless burger called
   the Beyond Burger. So today, part two of what has become a series on
   meatless burgers that are taking veggie burgers to a much meatier
   level.

   Kate wrote: “I tried the Beyond Burger once at a restaurant and thought
   it tasted delicious. I like the idea of having plant-based alternatives
   for things like burgers but I’m wary of the tendency to assume that
   just because something is vegan or vegetarian, it’s healthier
   (primarily because of your show). As a result, I don’t buy many
   processed vegan foods, but maybe this one is worth it?”

How does the Beyond Burger Compare to the Impossible Burger?

   Like the Impossible Burger, the Beyond Burger is a veggie burger that
   goes out of its way to mimic the look, taste, and texture of real
   ground beef. If you’re the kind of vegan that finds the thought of
   eating meat revolting, then neither of these products is likely to
   appeal to you. But if, like Kate, you enjoy eating the real thing but
   like the idea of cutting down on your consumption, either one of these
   might fit the bill.

   Like the Impossible Burger, the Beyond Burger looks like raw ground
   beef when you buy it. After cooking, it is still pink in the center. In
   the case of the Impossible Burger, the color comes from heme, a form of
   iron that is normally only found in animals. The color in the Beyond
   Burger, on the other hand, is supplied by beet extract. But the heme
   iron in the Impossible Burger imparts more than just color. Heme also
   contributes a characteristic metallic flavor that we associate
   primarily with red meat.

How Do Meatless Burgers Stack Up Nutritionally?

   Let me start by saying that the nutritional differences between these
   two burgers are not huge. Both are under 300 calories for a 4-ounce
   burger. But there are a few differences worth mentioning.

   Although the Beyond Burger is slightly higher in fat, it is much lower
   in saturated fat because it uses both canola and coconut oil, while the
   Impossible Burger uses only coconut oil. The Beyond Burger is also
   significantly lower in sodium and offers a small amount of fiber.

   beyond burger patty

   A couple of weeks ago, I wrote about a new meat alternative called the
   Impossible Burger and how it compares with real beef. Almost
   immediately, I started getting emails from listeners wanting to know
   how the Impossible Burger compared with another meatless burger called
   the Beyond Burger. So today, part two of what has become a series on
   meatless burgers that are taking veggie burgers to a much meatier
   level.

   Kate wrote: “I tried the Beyond Burger once at a restaurant and thought
   it tasted delicious. I like the idea of having plant-based alternatives
   for things like burgers but I’m wary of the tendency to assume that
   just because something is vegan or vegetarian, it’s healthier
   (primarily because of your show). As a result, I don’t buy many
   processed vegan foods, but maybe this one is worth it?”

How does the Beyond Burger Compare to the Impossible Burger?

   Like the Impossible Burger, the Beyond Burger is a veggie burger that
   goes out of its way to mimic the look, taste, and texture of real
   ground beef. If you’re the kind of vegan that finds the thought of
   eating meat revolting, then neither of these products is likely to
   appeal to you. But if, like Kate, you enjoy eating the real thing but
   like the idea of cutting down on your consumption, either one of these
   might fit the bill.

   Like the Impossible Burger, the Beyond Burger looks like raw ground
   beef when you buy it. After cooking, it is still pink in the center. In
   the case of the Impossible Burger, the color comes from heme, a form of
   iron that is normally only found in animals. The color in the Beyond
   Burger, on the other hand, is supplied by beet extract. But the heme
   iron in the Impossible Burger imparts more than just color. Heme also
   contributes a characteristic metallic flavor that we associate
   primarily with red meat.

How Do Meatless Burgers Stack Up Nutritionally?

   Let me start by saying that the nutritional differences between these
   two burgers are not huge. Both are under 300 calories for a 4-ounce
   burger. But there are a few differences worth mentioning.

   Although the Beyond Burger is slightly higher in fat, it is much lower
   in saturated fat because it uses both canola and coconut oil, while the
   Impossible Burger uses only coconut oil. The Beyond Burger is also
   significantly lower in sodium and offers a small amount of fiber.

   The Impossible Burger is about 25% higher in protein. But there are
   also some important differences in where the protein comes from. The
   Impossible Burger gets its protein from wheat and potato. It also
   contains a small amount of soy. The Beyond Burger, on the other hand,
   is made from pea protein. For those who are sensitive to wheat and/or
   soy, the advantage clearly goes to the Beyond Burger.

   However, pea protein can have different consequences. It’s somewhat
   notorious for producing a lot of gas, particularly if you’re not used
   to eating it. So, you might not want to try the Beyond Burger for the
   first time when on a first date.

How Do They Compare in Taste?

   Both of these products do a great job mimicking the appearance and
   texture of real ground beef. In terms of flavor, this is a subjective
   judgment but I think the Impossible Burger comes much closer to the
   taste of beef, probably due to the heme iron.

   For those who are sensitive to wheat and/or soy, the advantage clearly
   goes to the Beyond Burger. However, pea protein can have different
   consequences.

   Although the Beyond Burger doesn’t taste beany in any way, I found it a
   little more bland than the Impossible Burger. But I would find either
   one of these perfectly enjoyable at a backyard barbecue or burger
   joint.

   At the time of this writing, the Beyond Burger is the only one that’s
   available in your local grocery store. The Impossible Burger is only
   available in restaurants.

Is Fake Meat Too Processed to be Healthy?

   As Kate alluded to in her question, neither of these products could be
   considered a minimally processed food. A lot of manipulation has gone
   into transforming peas and potatoes into something that looks and
   tastes an awful lot like a hamburger.

   The Impossible Burger gets credit for having a slightly shorter and
   somewhat more recognizable ingredient list. But if your goal is to eat
   more whole and minimally-processed foods, both of these burgers would
   probably belong in the category of something that you’d enjoy
   occasionally but not as a daily staple.

   On the other hand, if your goal is to eat less meat and more
   plant-based protein, you might decide that more has been gained than
   lost here. I don't think all processed foods can be lumped into the
   same nefarious category. Processing can strip away nutrients, and it's
   often used to turn cheap ingredients into hyper-palatable junk food.
   But processing can also sometimes improve the nutritional profile of a
   food or serve other noble purposes, such as reducing food waste or, in
   this case, reducing beef consumption.

   What's your take? Have you tried the Beyond Burger? Do beefless burgers
   have a place in your diet? Why or why not? Post your thoughts below or
