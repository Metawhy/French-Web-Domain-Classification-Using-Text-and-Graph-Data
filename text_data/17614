   Dies to make the birds and leaves. Branch pattern and directions are
   included in PDF pattern
   Birds of a Feather Accuquilt quilt pattern
   This pattern is only available on Accuquilt.com website

   The birds and leaves were made using the Accuquilt Cutting systern
   using their dies. The birds and leaves are not included in the pattern.
   Dies used for this quilt:

   Studio Bird Trio (50435)

   Studio Quilter's Leaves #4 (50713)

   Studio Round Flower (50155)

   Notice the quilting of the branch in relief on top of the wall hanging.

   It was fun to use some crazy wonderful fabric scraps.
   I used white Kona cotton for the background.
