A Dad’s List of McDonald’s Hatred

   The below list has little to do with health or fair wages, but rather
   years of listening to my kids bitch about wanting to visit McDonalds
   every time we eat out, feeling them kick the front seat every time they
   are within view of a MacDonald’s, and the pain of stepping on jagged
   MacDonald’s toys in the night. I was indifferent towards MacDonald’s
   until I had kids. It’s funny how they change things. If you’d like to
   add to this list, please comment below.
   Before Tristan could say more than a handful words, he could point at
   the McDonald’s Golden Arches, grunt, and cry because he wanted to go
   there. This seems wrong.
   I often suspect that our McDonald’s toys are breeding.
   Whenever we go to McDonald’s I find myself saying, “You need to eat
   your fries and nuggets before you can get your toy.” This statement
   makes me feel like a good parent. Like I’m making my kids eat a good
   meal. But honesty, how healthy is the meal I am forcing them to eat?
   I’m sure this is extreme, but sometimes it feels like I’m forcing them
   to smoke a cigarette.
   The McDonald’s Play Place is always sticky. It kind of reminds me of
   the slime from Ghost Busters.
   Tristan once ate at McDonald’s twice in one day. He ended up having
   three episodes of diarrhea. I’m not a doctor, but that seems wrong.
   When I was a kid the McDonald’s ball pits always smelled like pee. And
   I once watched a naked drunk man jump into a McDonald’s ball pit
   (Before you label him a pervert, think about this: Which is more
   perverted... jumping into a ball pit while drunk and naked? Or watching
   a drunk and naked man jump into a ball pit?). I was going to try and
   swing this around to my mistrust of McDonald’s ball pits, but then I
   remembered that McDonald’s got rid of their pall pits. You win this
   round, McDonald’s!
   I can’t always see what my kids are doing in the back seat. But what I
   can see is the aftermath of a trip to McDonald’s. It always looks like
   they ripped the stupid toy out of the box, dumped the fries and nuggets
   out into a pile, and then mashed them into the upholstery with their
   little shoes and little hands, laughing the whole time. Once I asked
   Tristan (my six-year-old) why he does this, and he said, “It’s not that
   nice of a car. I don’t know what the big deal is.” After that comment,
   it was a long time before he got McDonald’s again.
   The McDonald’s $1 dollar coke makes my kidneys cry.
   The shoe cubbies always smell like a mix of honey, BBQ sauce, feet, and
   meat.
   I don’t trust clowns. Anyone that exaggerates the size of their feet
   has compensation issues.
