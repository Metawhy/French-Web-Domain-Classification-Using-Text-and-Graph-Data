Abstract

   A feebate on the purchase of new cars, the Bonus/Malus, was introduced
   in France in 2008. Less polluting cars benefited from a price reduction
   of up to 1,000 euro, whereas the most polluting ones were subject to a
   taxation of 2,600 euro. We estimate the impact of this policy on carbon
   dioxide emissions in the short and long run. If the shift towards the
   classes benefiting from rebates is considerable, we estimate the
   environmental impact of the policy to be negative. While feebates may
   be efficient tools for reducing CO emissions, they should thus be
   designed carefully to achieve their primary goal.

Abstract

   In many settings, there is a dearth of instruments, which hampers
   economists’ ability to investigate causal relations. We propose a quite
   general way to construct instruments: “granular instrumental variables”
   (GIVs). In the economies we study, a few large firms or countries
   account for a large share of economic activity. As they are large,
   their idiosyncratic shocks affect aggregate outcomes. This makes those
   idiosyncratic shocks valid instruments for aggregate shocks. We provide
   a methodology to extract idiosyncratic shocks from the data, this way
   creating GIVs. Those GIVs allow us to then estimate parameters of
   interest, including causal elasticities.
   We first illustrate the idea in a basic supply and demand framework: we
   achieve a novel identification of supply and demand elasticities, based
   on idiosyncratic shocks to supply or demand. We then show how the
   procedure can be adapted to handle many enrichments. We provide initial
   illustrations of the procedure with two applications. First, we measure
   how “sovereign yield shocks” spill over to other countries in the
   Eurozone. Second, we estimate short-term supply and demand elasticities
   in the oil market. Our estimates match well existing estimates that use
   much more complex and labor-intensive (e.g., narrative) methods. We
   sketch how GIVs could be useful to estimate a host of other causal
   parameters in economics.
