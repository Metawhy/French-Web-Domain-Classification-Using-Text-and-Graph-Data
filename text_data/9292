‚ÄúA world in which everyone has control over their digital life and enjoys
freedom and privacy.‚Äù

   KDE^¬Æ is an open community of friendly people who want to:
   Avatar icon
   Create software products which give users control, freedom and privacy.
   Icon Plasma with desktop background
   Provide users with excellent user experience and quality.
   Icon mobile device
   Enable users regardless of their location, background, abilities,
   operating system and device.
   Icon earth
   Promote the Free and Open-Source ecosystem.

   Projects we work on have grown from our origins of creating a desktop
   environment to cover every aspect of end-user software. The KDE
   Manifesto explains what projects we welcome.
