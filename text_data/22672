   Why TensorFlow

   TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
   It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and
   community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in
   ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications.
   About
   Easy model building

   Build and train ML models easily using intuitive high-level APIs like
   Keras with eager execution, which makes for immediate model iteration
   and easy debugging.
   Robust ML production anywhere

   Easily train and deploy models in the cloud, on-prem, in the browser,
   or on-device no matter what language you use.
   Powerful experimentation for research

   A simple and flexible architecture to take new ideas from concept to
   code, to state-of-the-art models, and to publication faster.

   Solutions to common ML problems

   Simple step-by-step walkthroughs to solve common ML problems with
   TensorFlow.
   For beginners
   Your first neural network

   Train a neural network to classify images of clothing, like sneakers
   and shirts, in this fast-paced overview of a complete TensorFlow
   program.
   For experts
   Generative adversarial networks

   Train a generative adversarial network to generate images of
   handwritten digits, using the Keras Subclassing API.
   For experts
   Neural machine translation with attention

   Train a sequence-to-sequence model for Spanish to English translation
   using the Keras Subclassing API.
