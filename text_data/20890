   Prequel: Alt-Frequencies – the News One Stories

   It's a couple of months before the events of Alt-Frequencies and you
   are the budding new editor-in-chief of national news radio station News
   One. The station is trying to find a new direction, and it will be your
   task to help them with this. Which stories will you choose to
   broadcast, which news angle will you pick? Try to make the right
   choices to successfully get through your trial period and get
   officially hired.
   Join a lively cast of journalists and news editors in a country on the
   brink of change. New inventions are being made and action groups
   emerge, while you as the new editor-in-chief try to make sense of it
   all. Play now! (FREE)

   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed in orci
   mattis, laoreet nunc vitae, viverra ante. Vestibulum mollis libero et
   pretium sagittis. Nam auctor suscipit nibh, ac lacinia lacus efficitur

   A time loop, a conspiracy and the biggest vote in history.
   Alt-Frequencies is an audio mystery game where you use the airwaves to
   open the world’s eyes to the truth.

   What happens when everyone is stuck in the same time loop, without
   knowing?
   Alt-Frequencies is an audio mystery game where you use the airwaves to
   open the world’s eyes to the truth. Record, rewind time and broadcast
   snippets of radio shows to expose radio hosts, conspiracy theorists,
   politicians, underground activists - and a dog. By redistributing
   information, you change what happens in the next 3 minute time loop and
   impact both news cycles and the lives of the people behind them. Listen
   as their personal stories evolve, in a world that seems to stand still.

Features

     * A new kind of narrative game that blurs the lines between the
       fantastical and the everyday while examining our relationship with
       mainstream media through the prism of radio stations.
     * Built-in accessibility features that make the game available to a
       wide range of people - including blind and visually impaired
       players.
     * Brought to life by a diverse cast of 20+ amazing voice performers,
       including TV, podcasts and YouTube personalities such as Jasika
       Nicole (Fringe, Welcome to Night Vale).
     * By the studio behind the critically acclaimed A Normal Lost Phone
       and Another Lost Phone: Laura’s Story.
