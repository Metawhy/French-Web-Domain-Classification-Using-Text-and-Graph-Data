Should You Buy Your Child an Echo or a Google Home?

   By Monica Chin 2018-06-30T13:00:00Z Amazon

   Kids love talking to digital assistants. But is it a good idea? Here's
   what the experts say.

   It's an exciting time to be a kid. From tablets to smartphones to your
   refrigerator, everything is getting smarter, with more fun features for
   kids to take advantage of. And with the recent release of the Echo Dot
   Kids Edition, your children could have their first opportunity to talk
   to, and play with, their very own voice assistant.

   The $79 Kids Edition comes in a protective case to shield against bumps
   and drops, and is fully loaded with kid-friendly audiobooks, games and
   music. Alexa itself is seemingly harmless, as it tells jokes, provides
   advice and answers your children's incessant questions in a friendly
   and patient way.

   However, there are concerns about giving an always-listening device to
   your child: What can or will it record, and can your kid use it for
   purposes other than those you intended? The same thing goes for the
   cute Google Home Mini.

   We asked tech and security experts about the pros and cons of buying a
   smart speaker for your kid, whether it's kid-specific or the real deal.
   Here's what we found.

Reasons for an Echo or a Google Home

   It's just plain fun. Some of the highest-rated Alexa games are aimed at
   kids, such as the Jeopardy! skill and the popular
   choose-your-own-adventure games Magic Door and Yes Sire. Other skills
   bring fun to mundane activities in a way that might be hard for parents
   to replicate. Bye Bye Cavities, for example, turns your kid's
   toothbrush routine into a quest to defeat the villainous "Cavity
   Family" while reinforcing proper brushing technique.

   In a recent Google-commissioned study from Kelton Research, 35 percent
   of Google Home owners said the device made it easier to entertain their
   kids. Amazon says that tens of millions of households use Alexa today,
   and that customers tend to enjoy using Alexa with their families.

   "The idea that you can talk to a computer and have it respond to you is
   exciting for kids," said Ben Arnold, senior director of innovation and
   trends at the Consumer Technology Association. Arnold says that he
   would "definitely be interested” in buying an Echo for his children.
   "Kids are enamored towards talking to Google Assistant or Alexa. They
   like that experience."

   It gets them ahead of the curve. "Voice is one of the most exciting
   things that's happening in technology," Arnold said. The research backs
   him up. Voice assistants are one of the fastest-growing adopted
   technologies, with Echo and Google Home ownership having tripled in the
   past year, according to a recent CTA study.

   In other words, by the time your kid's grown up, smart-home technology
   will probably be more ubiquitous than we could have imagined. The
   sooner your kids are comfortable listening to and talking to voice
   assistants — and the sooner they understand the security risks they
   bring — the better equipped they may be for the future.

   It means less screen time. Smartphone addiction is a real problem among
   kids and teens: A Common Sense Media poll showed that 50 percent of
   teenagers believe they're addicted to their phone, while 59 percent of
   parents reported that their teens were addicted, and 66 percent
   reported that their teens spend too much time on mobile devices.

   Alexa can offer your kids an interactive, screen-less alternative to
   mobile games and social media, to help prevent them from becoming too
   dependent. While many parents criticize their teens for using their
   phones in lieu of face-to-face interactions, Alexa encourages
   conversational skills. With FreeTime, you can even set positive
   reinforcement for using the word "please."

   "Kids spend a lot of time on screens," Arnold said. But with Alexa,
   "they're able to interact with technology away from the screen, using
   audio or their audio abilities."

Why You Should Skip

   Security and privacy concerns. When it comes to smart-home technology,
   convenience often comes with security risks. Geoffrey Schorz, national
   training manager at home-security company Swann Communications, was
   candid about Echo devices: "I don't want them in my kids' rooms."

   There are few instances of an Alexa device actually being hacked, and
   Amazon says that the Echo Dot Kids Edition is compliant with the
   Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. But new vulnerabilities
   spring up all the time.

   In April, security company Checkmarx was able to create an Alexa skill
   that would allow a hacker to record a user even after their interaction
   with Alexa had ended, and send that recording to the hacker. Back in
   November, Armis found that Echo and Google Home devices were vulnerable
   to the nefarious Bluetooth-enabled exploit BlueBorne, which could allow
   hackers to remotely access the devices without the owners' knowledge.

   Amazon quickly patched both of these vulnerabilities, but as Echo
   devices get more popular, they're sure to get more vulnerable, said
   Michael Parker, Armis' chief marketing officer. "Remember when we got
   laptops and put them on the internet — boom, all of a sudden you had
   all these viruses?" he said. Smart devices are, he said, "the new
   attack vector."

   But even when there's no hacker present, misinterpretation on Alexa's
   part can lead to bad news. In late May, an Echo device accidentally
   interpreted background conversation as direct commands, and ended up
   recording a user's private conversation and sending it to another user
   in her address book. As an adult, these are risks you can internalize —
   but the last thing you want is Alexa sending a recording of your child
   to a stranger.

   It's another distraction. Schorz cautions parents against providing
   their kids with a device that could potentially distract them from
   homework, chores and bedtime. Given that all a kid needs to do is say
   "Alexa" to start a game or activity, the temptation could be hard for
   some kids to resist, even if they've been instructed not to use it.

   MORE: Best Alexa Skills for Kids

   Fran Walfish, family and relationship psychotherapist and author of The
   Self Aware Parent, cautions parents not to let their kids become
   dependent on Alexa for homework help, setting reminders, calling Ubers,
   or other conveniences. The use of Alexa, she believes "enables
   dependency, rather than fostering autonomy by your kid to do things for
   himself."

   And if your older kids have an Echo Dot with access to your Amazon
   account, they could be tempted to make purchases, or download
   inappropriate content. "I've seen employees talk to Alexa and order
   things they shouldn't,"  Parker said.

What to do if you decide to buy an Echo or Google Home for your child

   If you decide to take the leap and buy your kid an Echo or Google Home,
   make sure you're aware of how to keep it secure. If you're worried
   about your kid's security, consider instructing them to mute their
   device at night, or even unplug it. Keep abreast of the latest
   vulnerabilities, and consider limiting your kid's use until they're
   patched.

   Schorz recommends setting some restrictions. "It's supervision. Pay
   attention to what your kids are doing.” Schorz doesn't allow his kids
   to access their Echo devices or other electronics without permission,
   and doesn't allow them in bedrooms.

   If you're worried about what your kid is doing, consider setting
   parental controls to limit their time (Here's how to enable FreeTime on
   any Echo device). An Amazon spokesperson said they'd heard from a
   number of parents who paused their children's Echo devices during
   homework time to prevent distraction (and potential cheating).

   And remember to keep a close eye on their interactions and purchases
   (and maybe turn off voice-purchasing, if they're using the adult
   version), to make sure they're not abusing the privilege.

Trump's Huawei Ban Could End Android As We Know It and Damage Apple (Update)

   By Jesus Diaz 2019-05-21T11:53:00Z Google

   If the world’s second biggest manufacturer has to fork its own Android
   OS and app ecosystem, Google may be in trouble in the long run.

   Update May 21 7:53 am ET: The U.S. Commerce Department has granted a
   90-day license for phone companies and internet providers to work with
   Huawei, an exemption that allows Google to send software updates to
   Huawei phones through August 19.

   Google is complying with Trump’s administration banning of Huawei, the
   world’s second biggest smartphone manufacturer. If this isn’t remedied
   in the short term, it may open a divide that may prove fatal to the
   platform and also have a lasting effect on other companies, like Apple.

   If you live in the US, you may think this will not affect you. After
   all, if you buy what the US government spy agencies say —  that Huawei
   is just a band of Chinese spies — who cares, right? Well, you should,
   even if you don’t use Huawei because the move will most surely have
   repercussions in the form of Chinese government retaliation — perhaps
   targeting Apple — and a potential division of the Android operating
   system.

   The effect on Huawei users

   Google — as Qualcomm, Intel, Microsoft, Corning, even companies like
   Dolby and many others — are US-based companies bound to US law. That
   means that this company has to stop any business with the Huawei: from
   selling them the glass for their screen to the OS for their computers
   and phones, to processors and modems, to apps and services like YouTube
   and Gmail.

   According to Avi Greengart — founder of consumer electronics market
   analysis firm Techsponential — this effectively puts Huawei out of
   business outside of China. In an email interview, Greengart told Tom’s
   Guide that “Huawei cannot sell smartphones outside China without
   Google’s Android operating system, Google’s PLAY store, and regular
   software and security updates. Inside China, Huawei can use the
   portions of Android that are open source and its own app store.”

   MORE: Huawei P30 Pro Review: A Photography Revolution

   Likewise, Huawei cannot sell laptops without Microsoft’s Windows
   operating system and Intel chips.

   As a reminder, Huawei’s Consumer Device Business unit brought over $50
   billion in revenues in 2018. “It sold 208 million phones only last
   year, approximately 80 million of them outside China,” according to
   Greengart, “and it’s the fastest growing company in Europe, with over
   20% market share.” That is a lot of phones.

   The impact on Huawei: 'Crippling' but good for Samsung

   Huawei will be severely impacted if is forced to stop using Google's
   version of Android. This sort of situation has never worked out well
   for others.

   "If I look at it through the lens of Android forks, this is a crippling
   situation," said Tuong Nguyen, senior principal analyst for Gartner.
   "Not having access to the convenience, familiarity, and ease of use of
   Google Play and all the associate Google apps is one of the big reasons
   Android fork smartphones aren’t as competitive as the non-forks."

   According to Greengart, Xiaomi and OPPO, two other Chinese companies
   expanding around the world, should immediately pick up sales. “Samsung
   could see a small uptick in flagship sales as well, particularly if
   Huawei is not able to resume sales and support when the Galaxy Fold and
   the next Note start shipping later this summer,” Greengart says.

   But that is “short term”. Perhaps Huawei will get out of its blacklist
   status as soon as China and the US reach a trade agreement. Or perhaps
   the blacklist will continue and Xiaomi and Oppo will be added.

   Impact on U.S. companies

   Many US companies will feel the impact, not big — like Intel,
   Microsoft, Qualcomm — and small firms — like Corning glass and Dolby.
   “Technology companies that count Huawei as a large customer will lose
   out on revenue and growth,” says Greengart, “Huawei’s device sales have
   been rising rapidly, which ripples throughout its supply chain.”

   Intel and Microsoft provide CPUs and the Windows OS to Huawei’s
   burgeoning PC business. But the Chinese manufacturer’s PC sales just
   started in 2017, so that impact will be limited. Qualcomm, Corning and
   other companies will suffer the most, as they make big chunks of their
   revenues from all those millions of phones that Huawei sells worldwide.

   Android: Google’s worst case scenario

   One of the possible outcomes of this is that Huawei may decide to
   release their own operating system. This will count with the potential
   involvement of the Chinese government — and its economic resources —and
   the rest of the Chinese Android manufacturers. After the ZTE debacle
   and this, it’s clear that the Chinese can’t afford to depend on the US
   for a crucial part of its infrastructure and business development.

   Companies like Xiaomi and Oppo can see the writing on the wall and
   decide to switch away from Android before they are too shunned by Trump
   or whoever in the next US government decides to ban as a political and
   economic bargaining chip.

   It’s not crazy to think that other companies through the world may join
   that effort, too. Remember that Europeans do not agree with US
   arguments and will not not follow any Huawei ban based on what they
   believe is questionable US intelligence. Their authorities and
   companies will not want to depend on the whims of the American
   government.

   If that happens, it will definetly affect Google, developers and, by
   extension, every Android phone user. Developers will eventually be
   forced to maintain two codebases. And users will have to make a choice,
   potentially dividing Android between the US and the rest of the world.

   "Fragmentation is a real concern," said Greengart. "There is a limit to
   how successful you can be selling things that consumers and enterprises
   don't want. Google, Apple, and Microsoft make the operating systems
   that have deep application and services ecosystems, are embedded in the
   hardware supply chain, and are well supported and updated."

   It will be ironic that, after years of fragmentation and Google
   fighting to make Android a solid ground for developers —just like Apple
   has done with iOS — now they have to face the opening of a potential
   war with the international Android manufacturers. It’s very possible
   that Google’s brass may be evaluating what to do next, including suing
   the US government.

   Apple: Potential collateral damage

   But the cluster-you-know-what doesn’t stop there. Like Greengart says,
   the indirect damage may be even worse. “Huawei is not just a large
   company, it one of the few Chinese companies with an international
   brand, and it is a source of national pride for the Chinese,” he says,
   “if the Chinese government wants to retaliate for trade restrictions
   crippling Huawei, it could target Apple.”

   That would mean potentially forbidding Apple products in China but also
   making Apple’s providers to stop having business with Apple. “This
   would not be without cost – Apple is a big employer inside China,”
   Greengart says, “and has good relationships with the government.” But
   all bets are off at this point. The Chinese government can very well
   give money to Foxconn and other Chinese Apple providers to offset for
   the losses of banning business with the Cupertino company.

   But Cook and company will have an extremely hard time scrambling to
   assemble a new supply and manufacturing line. Knowing Apple’s standards
   regarding timing and quality, the task will prove almost impossible in
   the short term.

   Add to that the fact that 17% of its revenues come from sales inside
   greater China. Greengart says that, while Apple can afford a temporary
   drop in sales, “any damage to its brand appeal in China could have a
   terrible long-lasting impact for the company.”

   In other words, whether you like Huawei or not and regardless of your
   opinion of Trump and his administration, this ban may have a huge and
   long-lasting effects for everyone involved.

Should You Buy Your Child an Echo or a Google Home?

   By Monica Chin 30 June 2018

Kids love talking to digital assistants. But is it a good idea? Here's what
the experts say.

   It's an exciting time to be a kid. From tablets to smartphones to your
   refrigerator, everything is getting smarter, with more fun features for
   kids to take advantage of. And with the recent release of the Echo Dot
   Kids Edition, your children could have their first opportunity to talk
   to, and play with, their very own voice assistant.

   The $79 Kids Edition comes in a protective case to shield against bumps
   and drops, and is fully loaded with kid-friendly audiobooks, games and
   music. Alexa itself is seemingly harmless, as it tells jokes, provides
   advice and answers your children's incessant questions in a friendly
   and patient way.

   However, there are concerns about giving an always-listening device to
   your child: What can or will it record, and can your kid use it for
   purposes other than those you intended? The same thing goes for the
   cute Google Home Mini.

   We asked tech and security experts about the pros and cons of buying a
   smart speaker for your kid, whether it's kid-specific or the real deal.
   Here's what we found.

Reasons for an Echo or a Google Home

   It's just plain fun. Some of the highest-rated Alexa games are aimed at
   kids, such as the Jeopardy! skill and the popular
   choose-your-own-adventure games Magic Door and Yes Sire. Other skills
   bring fun to mundane activities in a way that might be hard for parents
   to replicate. Bye Bye Cavities, for example, turns your kid's
   toothbrush routine into a quest to defeat the villainous "Cavity
   Family" while reinforcing proper brushing technique.

   In a recent Google-commissioned study from Kelton Research, 35 percent
   of Google Home owners said the device made it easier to entertain their
   kids. Amazon says that tens of millions of households use Alexa today,
   and that customers tend to enjoy using Alexa with their families.

   "The idea that you can talk to a computer and have it respond to you is
   exciting for kids," said Ben Arnold, senior director of innovation and
   trends at the Consumer Technology Association. Arnold says that he
   would "definitely be interested” in buying an Echo for his children.
   "Kids are enamored towards talking to Google Assistant or Alexa. They
   like that experience."

   It gets them ahead of the curve. "Voice is one of the most exciting
   things that's happening in technology," Arnold said. The research backs
   him up. Voice assistants are one of the fastest-growing adopted
   technologies, with Echo and Google Home ownership having tripled in the
   past year, according to a recent CTA study.

   In other words, by the time your kid's grown up, smart-home technology
   will probably be more ubiquitous than we could have imagined. The
   sooner your kids are comfortable listening to and talking to voice
   assistants — and the sooner they understand the security risks they
   bring — the better equipped they may be for the future.

   It means less screen time. Smartphone addiction is a real problem among
   kids and teens: A Common Sense Media poll showed that 50 percent of
   teenagers believe they're addicted to their phone, while 59 percent of
   parents reported that their teens were addicted, and 66 percent
   reported that their teens spend too much time on mobile devices.

   Alexa can offer your kids an interactive, screen-less alternative to
   mobile games and social media, to help prevent them from becoming too
   dependent. While many parents criticize their teens for using their
   phones in lieu of face-to-face interactions, Alexa encourages
   conversational skills. With FreeTime, you can even set positive
   reinforcement for using the word "please."

   "Kids spend a lot of time on screens," Arnold said. But with Alexa,
   "they're able to interact with technology away from the screen, using
   audio or their audio abilities."

Why You Should Skip

   Security and privacy concerns. When it comes to smart-home technology,
   convenience often comes with security risks. Geoffrey Schorz, national
   training manager at home-security company Swann Communications, was
   candid about Echo devices: "I don't want them in my kids' rooms."

   There are few instances of an Alexa device actually being hacked, and
   Amazon says that the Echo Dot Kids Edition is compliant with the
   Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. But new vulnerabilities
   spring up all the time.

   In April, security company Checkmarx was able to create an Alexa skill
   that would allow a hacker to record a user even after their interaction
   with Alexa had ended, and send that recording to the hacker. Back in
   November, Armis found that Echo and Google Home devices were vulnerable
   to the nefarious Bluetooth-enabled exploit BlueBorne, which could allow
   hackers to remotely access the devices without the owners' knowledge.

   Amazon quickly patched both of these vulnerabilities, but as Echo
   devices get more popular, they're sure to get more vulnerable, said
   Michael Parker, Armis' chief marketing officer. "Remember when we got
   laptops and put them on the internet — boom, all of a sudden you had
   all these viruses?" he said. Smart devices are, he said, "the new
   attack vector."

   But even when there's no hacker present, misinterpretation on Alexa's
   part can lead to bad news. In late May, an Echo device accidentally
   interpreted background conversation as direct commands, and ended up
   recording a user's private conversation and sending it to another user
   in her address book. As an adult, these are risks you can internalize —
   but the last thing you want is Alexa sending a recording of your child
   to a stranger.

   It's another distraction. Schorz cautions parents against providing
   their kids with a device that could potentially distract them from
   homework, chores and bedtime. Given that all a kid needs to do is say
   "Alexa" to start a game or activity, the temptation could be hard for
   some kids to resist, even if they've been instructed not to use it.

   MORE: Best Alexa Skills for Kids

   Fran Walfish, family and relationship psychotherapist and author of The
   Self Aware Parent, cautions parents not to let their kids become
   dependent on Alexa for homework help, setting reminders, calling Ubers,
   or other conveniences. The use of Alexa, she believes "enables
   dependency, rather than fostering autonomy by your kid to do things for
   himself."

   And if your older kids have an Echo Dot with access to your Amazon
   account, they could be tempted to make purchases, or download
   inappropriate content. "I've seen employees talk to Alexa and order
   things they shouldn't,"  Parker said.

What to do if you decide to buy an Echo or Google Home for your child

   If you decide to take the leap and buy your kid an Echo or Google Home,
   make sure you're aware of how to keep it secure. If you're worried
   about your kid's security, consider instructing them to mute their
   device at night, or even unplug it. Keep abreast of the latest
   vulnerabilities, and consider limiting your kid's use until they're
   patched.

   Schorz recommends setting some restrictions. "It's supervision. Pay
   attention to what your kids are doing.” Schorz doesn't allow his kids
   to access their Echo devices or other electronics without permission,
   and doesn't allow them in bedrooms.

   If you're worried about what your kid is doing, consider setting
   parental controls to limit their time (Here's how to enable FreeTime on
   any Echo device). An Amazon spokesperson said they'd heard from a
   number of parents who paused their children's Echo devices during
   homework time to prevent distraction (and potential cheating).

   And remember to keep a close eye on their interactions and purchases
   (and maybe turn off voice-purchasing, if they're using the adult
   version), to make sure they're not abusing the privilege.

Trump's Huawei Ban Could End Android As We Know It and Damage Apple (Update)

   By Jesus Diaz 21 May 2019

If the world’s second biggest manufacturer has to fork its own Android OS and
app ecosystem, Google may be in trouble in the long run.

   Update May 21 7:53 am ET: The U.S. Commerce Department has granted a
   90-day license for phone companies and internet providers to work with
   Huawei, an exemption that allows Google to send software updates to
   Huawei phones through August 19.

   Google is complying with Trump’s administration banning of Huawei, the
   world’s second biggest smartphone manufacturer. If this isn’t remedied
   in the short term, it may open a divide that may prove fatal to the
   platform and also have a lasting effect on other companies, like Apple.
   (Image: © FRED DUFOUR/AFP/Getty Images)

   If you live in the US, you may think this will not affect you. After
   all, if you buy what the US government spy agencies say —  that Huawei
   is just a band of Chinese spies — who cares, right? Well, you should,
   even if you don’t use Huawei because the move will most surely have
   repercussions in the form of Chinese government retaliation — perhaps
   targeting Apple — and a potential division of the Android operating
   system.

   The effect on Huawei users

   Google — as Qualcomm, Intel, Microsoft, Corning, even companies like
   Dolby and many others — are US-based companies bound to US law. That
   means that this company has to stop any business with the Huawei: from
   selling them the glass for their screen to the OS for their computers
   and phones, to processors and modems, to apps and services like YouTube
   and Gmail.

   According to Avi Greengart — founder of consumer electronics market
   analysis firm Techsponential — this effectively puts Huawei out of
   business outside of China. In an email interview, Greengart told Tom’s
   Guide that “Huawei cannot sell smartphones outside China without
   Google’s Android operating system, Google’s PLAY store, and regular
   software and security updates. Inside China, Huawei can use the
   portions of Android that are open source and its own app store.”

   Likewise, Huawei cannot sell laptops without Microsoft’s Windows
   operating system and Intel chips.

   As a reminder, Huawei’s Consumer Device Business unit brought over $50
   billion in revenues in 2018. “It sold 208 million phones only last
   year, approximately 80 million of them outside China,” according to
   Greengart, “and it’s the fastest growing company in Europe, with over
   20% market share.” That is a lot of phones.

   The impact on Huawei: 'Crippling' but good for Samsung

   Huawei will be severely impacted if is forced to stop using Google's
   version of Android. This sort of situation has never worked out well
   for others.

   "If I look at it through the lens of Android forks, this is a crippling
   situation," said Tuong Nguyen, senior principal analyst for Gartner.
   "Not having access to the convenience, familiarity, and ease of use of
   Google Play and all the associate Google apps is one of the big reasons
   Android fork smartphones aren’t as competitive as the non-forks."

   According to Greengart, Xiaomi and OPPO, two other Chinese companies
   expanding around the world, should immediately pick up sales. “Samsung
   could see a small uptick in flagship sales as well, particularly if
   Huawei is not able to resume sales and support when the Galaxy Fold and
   the next Note start shipping later this summer,” Greengart says.

   But that is “short term”. Perhaps Huawei will get out of its blacklist
   status as soon as China and the US reach a trade agreement. Or perhaps
   the blacklist will continue and Xiaomi and Oppo will be added.

   Impact on U.S. companies

   Many US companies will feel the impact, not big — like Intel,
   Microsoft, Qualcomm — and small firms — like Corning glass and Dolby.
   “Technology companies that count Huawei as a large customer will lose
   out on revenue and growth,” says Greengart, “Huawei’s device sales have
   been rising rapidly, which ripples throughout its supply chain.”

   Intel and Microsoft provide CPUs and the Windows OS to Huawei’s
   burgeoning PC business. But the Chinese manufacturer’s PC sales just
   started in 2017, so that impact will be limited. Qualcomm, Corning and
   other companies will suffer the most, as they make big chunks of their
   revenues from all those millions of phones that Huawei sells worldwide.

   Android: Google’s worst case scenario

   One of the possible outcomes of this is that Huawei may decide to
   release their own operating system. This will count with the potential
   involvement of the Chinese government — and its economic resources —and
   the rest of the Chinese Android manufacturers. After the ZTE debacle
   and this, it’s clear that the Chinese can’t afford to depend on the US
   for a crucial part of its infrastructure and business development.

   Companies like Xiaomi and Oppo can see the writing on the wall and
   decide to switch away from Android before they are too shunned by Trump
   or whoever in the next US government decides to ban as a political and
   economic bargaining chip.

   It’s not crazy to think that other companies through the world may join
   that effort, too. Remember that Europeans do not agree with US
   arguments and will not not follow any Huawei ban based on what they
   believe is questionable US intelligence. Their authorities and
   companies will not want to depend on the whims of the American
   government.

   If that happens, it will definetly affect Google, developers and, by
   extension, every Android phone user. Developers will eventually be
   forced to maintain two codebases. And users will have to make a choice,
   potentially dividing Android between the US and the rest of the world.

   "Fragmentation is a real concern," said Greengart. "There is a limit to
   how successful you can be selling things that consumers and enterprises
   don't want. Google, Apple, and Microsoft make the operating systems
   that have deep application and services ecosystems, are embedded in the
   hardware supply chain, and are well supported and updated."

   It will be ironic that, after years of fragmentation and Google
   fighting to make Android a solid ground for developers —just like Apple
   has done with iOS — now they have to face the opening of a potential
   war with the international Android manufacturers. It’s very possible
   that Google’s brass may be evaluating what to do next, including suing
   the US government.

   Apple: Potential collateral damage

   But the cluster-you-know-what doesn’t stop there. Like Greengart says,
   the indirect damage may be even worse. “Huawei is not just a large
   company, it one of the few Chinese companies with an international
   brand, and it is a source of national pride for the Chinese,” he says,
   “if the Chinese government wants to retaliate for trade restrictions
   crippling Huawei, it could target Apple.”

   That would mean potentially forbidding Apple products in China but also
   making Apple’s providers to stop having business with Apple. “This
   would not be without cost – Apple is a big employer inside China,”
   Greengart says, “and has good relationships with the government.” But
   all bets are off at this point. The Chinese government can very well
   give money to Foxconn and other Chinese Apple providers to offset for
   the losses of banning business with the Cupertino company.

   But Cook and company will have an extremely hard time scrambling to
   assemble a new supply and manufacturing line. Knowing Apple’s standards
   regarding timing and quality, the task will prove almost impossible in
   the short term.

   Add to that the fact that 17% of its revenues come from sales inside
   greater China. Greengart says that, while Apple can afford a temporary
   drop in sales, “any damage to its brand appeal in China could have a
   terrible long-lasting impact for the company.”

   In other words, whether you like Huawei or not and regardless of your
   opinion of Trump and his administration, this ban may have a huge and
   long-lasting effects for everyone involved.

Should You Buy Your Child an Echo or a Google Home?

Trump's Huawei Ban Could End Android As We Know It and Damage Apple (Update)

   By Jesus Diaz 2019-05-21T11:53:00Z Google

   If the world’s second biggest manufacturer has to fork its own Android
   OS and app ecosystem, Google may be in trouble in the long run.

   Update May 21 7:53 am ET: The U.S. Commerce Department has granted a
   90-day license for phone companies and internet providers to work with
   Huawei, an exemption that allows Google to send software updates to
   Huawei phones through August 19.

   Google is complying with Trump’s administration banning of Huawei, the
   world’s second biggest smartphone manufacturer. If this isn’t remedied
   in the short term, it may open a divide that may prove fatal to the
   platform and also have a lasting effect on other companies, like Apple.

   If you live in the US, you may think this will not affect you. After
   all, if you buy what the US government spy agencies say —  that Huawei
   is just a band of Chinese spies — who cares, right? Well, you should,
   even if you don’t use Huawei because the move will most surely have
   repercussions in the form of Chinese government retaliation — perhaps
   targeting Apple — and a potential division of the Android operating
   system.

   The effect on Huawei users

   Google — as Qualcomm, Intel, Microsoft, Corning, even companies like
   Dolby and many others — are US-based companies bound to US law. That
   means that this company has to stop any business with the Huawei: from
   selling them the glass for their screen to the OS for their computers
   and phones, to processors and modems, to apps and services like YouTube
   and Gmail.

   According to Avi Greengart — founder of consumer electronics market
   analysis firm Techsponential — this effectively puts Huawei out of
   business outside of China. In an email interview, Greengart told Tom’s
   Guide that “Huawei cannot sell smartphones outside China without
   Google’s Android operating system, Google’s PLAY store, and regular
   software and security updates. Inside China, Huawei can use the
   portions of Android that are open source and its own app store.”

   Likewise, Huawei cannot sell laptops without Microsoft’s Windows
   operating system and Intel chips.

   As a reminder, Huawei’s Consumer Device Business unit brought over $50
   billion in revenues in 2018. “It sold 208 million phones only last
   year, approximately 80 million of them outside China,” according to
   Greengart, “and it’s the fastest growing company in Europe, with over
   20% market share.” That is a lot of phones.

   The impact on Huawei: 'Crippling' but good for Samsung

   Huawei will be severely impacted if is forced to stop using Google's
   version of Android. This sort of situation has never worked out well
   for others.

   "If I look at it through the lens of Android forks, this is a crippling
   situation," said Tuong Nguyen, senior principal analyst for Gartner.
   "Not having access to the convenience, familiarity, and ease of use of
   Google Play and all the associate Google apps is one of the big reasons
   Android fork smartphones aren’t as competitive as the non-forks."

   According to Greengart, Xiaomi and OPPO, two other Chinese companies
   expanding around the world, should immediately pick up sales. “Samsung
   could see a small uptick in flagship sales as well, particularly if
   Huawei is not able to resume sales and support when the Galaxy Fold and
   the next Note start shipping later this summer,” Greengart says.

   But that is “short term”. Perhaps Huawei will get out of its blacklist
   status as soon as China and the US reach a trade agreement. Or perhaps
   the blacklist will continue and Xiaomi and Oppo will be added.

   Impact on U.S. companies

   Many US companies will feel the impact, not big — like Intel,
   Microsoft, Qualcomm — and small firms — like Corning glass and Dolby.
   “Technology companies that count Huawei as a large customer will lose
   out on revenue and growth,” says Greengart, “Huawei’s device sales have
   been rising rapidly, which ripples throughout its supply chain.”

   Intel and Microsoft provide CPUs and the Windows OS to Huawei’s
   burgeoning PC business. But the Chinese manufacturer’s PC sales just
   started in 2017, so that impact will be limited. Qualcomm, Corning and
   other companies will suffer the most, as they make big chunks of their
   revenues from all those millions of phones that Huawei sells worldwide.

   Android: Google’s worst case scenario

   One of the possible outcomes of this is that Huawei may decide to
   release their own operating system. This will count with the potential
   involvement of the Chinese government — and its economic resources —and
   the rest of the Chinese Android manufacturers. After the ZTE debacle
   and this, it’s clear that the Chinese can’t afford to depend on the US
   for a crucial part of its infrastructure and business development.

   Companies like Xiaomi and Oppo can see the writing on the wall and
   decide to switch away from Android before they are too shunned by Trump
   or whoever in the next US government decides to ban as a political and
   economic bargaining chip.

   It’s not crazy to think that other companies through the world may join
   that effort, too. Remember that Europeans do not agree with US
   arguments and will not not follow any Huawei ban based on what they
   believe is questionable US intelligence. Their authorities and
   companies will not want to depend on the whims of the American
   government.

   If that happens, it will definetly affect Google, developers and, by
   extension, every Android phone user. Developers will eventually be
   forced to maintain two codebases. And users will have to make a choice,
   potentially dividing Android between the US and the rest of the world.

   "Fragmentation is a real concern," said Greengart. "There is a limit to
   how successful you can be selling things that consumers and enterprises
   don't want. Google, Apple, and Microsoft make the operating systems
   that have deep application and services ecosystems, are embedded in the
   hardware supply chain, and are well supported and updated."

   It will be ironic that, after years of fragmentation and Google
   fighting to make Android a solid ground for developers —just like Apple
   has done with iOS — now they have to face the opening of a potential
   war with the international Android manufacturers. It’s very possible
   that Google’s brass may be evaluating what to do next, including suing
   the US government.

   Apple: Potential collateral damage

   But the cluster-you-know-what doesn’t stop there. Like Greengart says,
   the indirect damage may be even worse. “Huawei is not just a large
   company, it one of the few Chinese companies with an international
   brand, and it is a source of national pride for the Chinese,” he says,
   “if the Chinese government wants to retaliate for trade restrictions
   crippling Huawei, it could target Apple.”

   That would mean potentially forbidding Apple products in China but also
   making Apple’s providers to stop having business with Apple. “This
   would not be without cost – Apple is a big employer inside China,”
   Greengart says, “and has good relationships with the government.” But
   all bets are off at this point. The Chinese government can very well
   give money to Foxconn and other Chinese Apple providers to offset for
   the losses of banning business with the Cupertino company.

   But Cook and company will have an extremely hard time scrambling to
   assemble a new supply and manufacturing line. Knowing Apple’s standards
   regarding timing and quality, the task will prove almost impossible in
   the short term.

   Add to that the fact that 17% of its revenues come from sales inside
   greater China. Greengart says that, while Apple can afford a temporary
   drop in sales, “any damage to its brand appeal in China could have a
   terrible long-lasting impact for the company.”

   In other words, whether you like Huawei or not and regardless of your
   opinion of Trump and his administration, this ban may have a huge and
   long-lasting effects for everyone involved.

Should You Buy Your Child an Echo or a Google Home?

   By Monica Chin 30 June 2018
     *
     *
     *
     *
     *

Kids love talking to digital assistants. But is it a good idea? Here's what
the experts say.

   It's an exciting time to be a kid. From tablets to smartphones to your
   refrigerator, everything is getting smarter, with more fun features for
   kids to take advantage of. And with the recent release of the Echo Dot
   Kids Edition, your children could have their first opportunity to talk
   to, and play with, their very own voice assistant.

   The $79 Kids Edition comes in a protective case to shield against bumps
   and drops, and is fully loaded with kid-friendly audiobooks, games and
   music. Alexa itself is seemingly harmless, as it tells jokes, provides
   advice and answers your children's incessant questions in a friendly
   and patient way.

   However, there are concerns about giving an always-listening device to
   your child: What can or will it record, and can your kid use it for
   purposes other than those you intended? The same thing goes for the
   cute Google Home Mini.

   We asked tech and security experts about the pros and cons of buying a
   smart speaker for your kid, whether it's kid-specific or the real deal.
   Here's what we found.

Reasons for an Echo or a Google Home

   It's just plain fun. Some of the highest-rated Alexa games are aimed at
   kids, such as the Jeopardy! skill and the popular
   choose-your-own-adventure games Magic Door and Yes Sire. Other skills
   bring fun to mundane activities in a way that might be hard for parents
   to replicate. Bye Bye Cavities, for example, turns your kid's
   toothbrush routine into a quest to defeat the villainous "Cavity
   Family" while reinforcing proper brushing technique.
   (Image: © Tom's Guide)

   In a recent Google-commissioned study from Kelton Research, 35 percent
   of Google Home owners said the device made it easier to entertain their
   kids. Amazon says that tens of millions of households use Alexa today,
   and that customers tend to enjoy using Alexa with their families.

   "The idea that you can talk to a computer and have it respond to you is
   exciting for kids," said Ben Arnold, senior director of innovation and
   trends at the Consumer Technology Association. Arnold says that he
   would "definitely be interested” in buying an Echo for his children.
   "Kids are enamored towards talking to Google Assistant or Alexa. They
   like that experience."

   It gets them ahead of the curve. "Voice is one of the most exciting
   things that's happening in technology," Arnold said. The research backs
   him up. Voice assistants are one of the fastest-growing adopted
   technologies, with Echo and Google Home ownership having tripled in the
   past year, according to a recent CTA study.

   In other words, by the time your kid's grown up, smart-home technology
   will probably be more ubiquitous than we could have imagined. The
   sooner your kids are comfortable listening to and talking to voice
   assistants — and the sooner they understand the security risks they
   bring — the better equipped they may be for the future.

   It means less screen time. Smartphone addiction is a real problem among
   kids and teens: A Common Sense Media poll showed that 50 percent of
   teenagers believe they're addicted to their phone, while 59 percent of
   parents reported that their teens were addicted, and 66 percent
   reported that their teens spend too much time on mobile devices.

   Alexa can offer your kids an interactive, screen-less alternative to
   mobile games and social media, to help prevent them from becoming too
   dependent. While many parents criticize their teens for using their
   phones in lieu of face-to-face interactions, Alexa encourages
   conversational skills. With FreeTime, you can even set positive
   reinforcement for using the word "please."

   "Kids spend a lot of time on screens," Arnold said. But with Alexa,
   "they're able to interact with technology away from the screen, using
   audio or their audio abilities."

Why You Should Skip

   Security and privacy concerns. When it comes to smart-home technology,
   convenience often comes with security risks. Geoffrey Schorz, national
   training manager at home-security company Swann Communications, was
   candid about Echo devices: "I don't want them in my kids' rooms."

   There are few instances of an Alexa device actually being hacked, and
   Amazon says that the Echo Dot Kids Edition is compliant with the
   Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. But new vulnerabilities
   spring up all the time.

   In April, security company Checkmarx was able to create an Alexa skill
   that would allow a hacker to record a user even after their interaction
   with Alexa had ended, and send that recording to the hacker. Back in
   November, Armis found that Echo and Google Home devices were vulnerable
   to the nefarious Bluetooth-enabled exploit BlueBorne, which could allow
   hackers to remotely access the devices without the owners' knowledge.

   Amazon quickly patched both of these vulnerabilities, but as Echo
   devices get more popular, they're sure to get more vulnerable, said
   Michael Parker, Armis' chief marketing officer. "Remember when we got
   laptops and put them on the internet — boom, all of a sudden you had
   all these viruses?" he said. Smart devices are, he said, "the new
   attack vector."

   But even when there's no hacker present, misinterpretation on Alexa's
   part can lead to bad news. In late May, an Echo device accidentally
   interpreted background conversation as direct commands, and ended up
   recording a user's private conversation and sending it to another user
   in her address book. As an adult, these are risks you can internalize —
   but the last thing you want is Alexa sending a recording of your child
   to a stranger.

   It's another distraction. Schorz cautions parents against providing
   their kids with a device that could potentially distract them from
   homework, chores and bedtime. Given that all a kid needs to do is say
   "Alexa" to start a game or activity, the temptation could be hard for
   some kids to resist, even if they've been instructed not to use it.

   MORE: Best Alexa Skills for Kids

   Fran Walfish, family and relationship psychotherapist and author of The
   Self Aware Parent, cautions parents not to let their kids become
   dependent on Alexa for homework help, setting reminders, calling Ubers,
   or other conveniences. The use of Alexa, she believes "enables
   dependency, rather than fostering autonomy by your kid to do things for
   himself."

   And if your older kids have an Echo Dot with access to your Amazon
   account, they could be tempted to make purchases, or download
   inappropriate content. "I've seen employees talk to Alexa and order
   things they shouldn't,"  Parker said.

What to do if you decide to buy an Echo or Google Home for your child

   If you decide to take the leap and buy your kid an Echo or Google Home,
   make sure you're aware of how to keep it secure. If you're worried
   about your kid's security, consider instructing them to mute their
   device at night, or even unplug it. Keep abreast of the latest
   vulnerabilities, and consider limiting your kid's use until they're
   patched.

   Schorz recommends setting some restrictions. "It's supervision. Pay
   attention to what your kids are doing.” Schorz doesn't allow his kids
   to access their Echo devices or other electronics without permission,
   and doesn't allow them in bedrooms.

   If you're worried about what your kid is doing, consider setting

Trump's Huawei Ban Could End Android As We Know It and Damage Apple (Update)

   By Jesus Diaz 21 May 2019

If the world’s second biggest manufacturer has to fork its own Android OS and
app ecosystem, Google may be in trouble in the long run.

   Update May 21 7:53 am ET: The U.S. Commerce Department has granted a
   90-day license for phone companies and internet providers to work with
   Huawei, an exemption that allows Google to send software updates to
   Huawei phones through August 19.

   Google is complying with Trump’s administration banning of Huawei, the
   world’s second biggest smartphone manufacturer. If this isn’t remedied
   in the short term, it may open a divide that may prove fatal to the
   platform and also have a lasting effect on other companies, like Apple.

   If you live in the US, you may think this will not affect you. After
   all, if you buy what the US government spy agencies say —  that Huawei
   is just a band of Chinese spies — who cares, right? Well, you should,
   even if you don’t use Huawei because the move will most surely have
   repercussions in the form of Chinese government retaliation — perhaps
   targeting Apple — and a potential division of the Android operating
   system.

   The effect on Huawei users

   Google — as Qualcomm, Intel, Microsoft, Corning, even companies like
   Dolby and many others — are US-based companies bound to US law. That
   means that this company has to stop any business with the Huawei: from
   selling them the glass for their screen to the OS for their computers
   and phones, to processors and modems, to apps and services like YouTube
   and Gmail.

   According to Avi Greengart — founder of consumer electronics market
   analysis firm Techsponential — this effectively puts Huawei out of
   business outside of China. In an email interview, Greengart told Tom’s
   Guide that “Huawei cannot sell smartphones outside China without
   Google’s Android operating system, Google’s PLAY store, and regular
   software and security updates. Inside China, Huawei can use the
   portions of Android that are open source and its own app store.”

   Likewise, Huawei cannot sell laptops without Microsoft’s Windows
   operating system and Intel chips.

   As a reminder, Huawei’s Consumer Device Business unit brought over $50
   billion in revenues in 2018. “It sold 208 million phones only last
   year, approximately 80 million of them outside China,” according to
   Greengart, “and it’s the fastest growing company in Europe, with over
   20% market share.” That is a lot of phones.

   The impact on Huawei: 'Crippling' but good for Samsung

   Huawei will be severely impacted if is forced to stop using Google's
   version of Android. This sort of situation has never worked out well
   for others.

   "If I look at it through the lens of Android forks, this is a crippling
   situation," said Tuong Nguyen, senior principal analyst for Gartner.
   "Not having access to the convenience, familiarity, and ease of use of
   Google Play and all the associate Google apps is one of the big reasons
   Android fork smartphones aren’t as competitive as the non-forks."

   According to Greengart, Xiaomi and OPPO, two other Chinese companies
   expanding around the world, should immediately pick up sales. “Samsung
   could see a small uptick in flagship sales as well, particularly if
   Huawei is not able to resume sales and support when the Galaxy Fold and
   the next Note start shipping later this summer,” Greengart says.

   But that is “short term”. Perhaps Huawei will get out of its blacklist
   status as soon as China and the US reach a trade agreement. Or perhaps
   the blacklist will continue and Xiaomi and Oppo will be added.

   Impact on U.S. companies

   Many US companies will feel the impact, not big — like Intel,
   Microsoft, Qualcomm — and small firms — like Corning glass and Dolby.
   “Technology companies that count Huawei as a large customer will lose
   out on revenue and growth,” says Greengart, “Huawei’s device sales have
   been rising rapidly, which ripples throughout its supply chain.”

   Intel and Microsoft provide CPUs and the Windows OS to Huawei’s
   burgeoning PC business. But the Chinese manufacturer’s PC sales just
   started in 2017, so that impact will be limited. Qualcomm, Corning and
   other companies will suffer the most, as they make big chunks of their
   revenues from all those millions of phones that Huawei sells worldwide.

   Android: Google’s worst case scenario

   One of the possible outcomes of this is that Huawei may decide to
   release their own operating system. This will count with the potential
   involvement of the Chinese government — and its economic resources —and
   the rest of the Chinese Android manufacturers. After the ZTE debacle
   and this, it’s clear that the Chinese can’t afford to depend on the US
   for a crucial part of its infrastructure and business development.

   Companies like Xiaomi and Oppo can see the writing on the wall and
   decide to switch away from Android before they are too shunned by Trump
   or whoever in the next US government decides to ban as a political and
   economic bargaining chip.

   It’s not crazy to think that other companies through the world may join
   that effort, too. Remember that Europeans do not agree with US
   arguments and will not not follow any Huawei ban based on what they
   believe is questionable US intelligence. Their authorities and
   companies will not want to depend on the whims of the American
   government.

   If that happens, it will definetly affect Google, developers and, by
   extension, every Android phone user. Developers will eventually be
   forced to maintain two codebases. And users will have to make a choice,
   potentially dividing Android between the US and the rest of the world.

   "Fragmentation is a real concern," said Greengart. "There is a limit to
   how successful you can be selling things that consumers and enterprises
   don't want. Google, Apple, and Microsoft make the operating systems
   that have deep application and services ecosystems, are embedded in the
   hardware supply chain, and are well supported and updated."

   It will be ironic that, after years of fragmentation and Google
   fighting to make Android a solid ground for developers —just like Apple
   has done with iOS — now they have to face the opening of a potential
   war with the international Android manufacturers. It’s very possible
   that Google’s brass may be evaluating what to do next, including suing
   the US government.

   Apple: Potential collateral damage

   But the cluster-you-know-what doesn’t stop there. Like Greengart says,
   the indirect damage may be even worse. “Huawei is not just a large
   company, it one of the few Chinese companies with an international
   brand, and it is a source of national pride for the Chinese,” he says,
   “if the Chinese government wants to retaliate for trade restrictions
   crippling Huawei, it could target Apple.”

   That would mean potentially forbidding Apple products in China but also
   making Apple’s providers to stop having business with Apple. “This
   would not be without cost – Apple is a big employer inside China,”
   Greengart says, “and has good relationships with the government.” But
   all bets are off at this point. The Chinese government can very well
   give money to Foxconn and other Chinese Apple providers to offset for
   the losses of banning business with the Cupertino company.

   But Cook and company will have an extremely hard time scrambling to
   assemble a new supply and manufacturing line. Knowing Apple’s standards
   regarding timing and quality, the task will prove almost impossible in
   the short term.

   Add to that the fact that 17% of its revenues come from sales inside
   greater China. Greengart says that, while Apple can afford a temporary
   drop in sales, “any damage to its brand appeal in China could have a
   terrible long-lasting impact for the company.”

   In other words, whether you like Huawei or not and regardless of your
   opinion of Trump and his administration, this ban may have a huge and
   long-lasting effects for everyone involved.
