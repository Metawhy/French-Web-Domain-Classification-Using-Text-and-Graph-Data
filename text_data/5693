Tenth Life's Mission:

Giving cats the lives they deserve.

At Tenth Life, we believe that every cat, regardless of emotional or physical
limitations, deserves the chance at a fulfilling and happy life.

We provide veterinary care, foster homes, and adoptive placement to stray
cats and kittens, prioritizing those with special needs. We work to end
unnecessary euthanasia and cat homelessness through educational outreach,
community programs, and collaborative partnerships.
Only when a trusted veterinarian determines that a cat is in a state
of incurable suffering, does Tenth Life relieve them of their pain through
gentle and humane euthanasia. This difficult and thoughtful decision is never
made in response to a lack of space, negative behaviors, or because a cat's
medical needs are challenging or expensive.
To learn more about some of the cats we prioritize, watch our video.

Tenth Life. When Nine Aren't Enough.

   [TenthLife0056circle.png]
   Tenth Life feels strongly that all pets should be spayed and neutered.
   Millions of companion animals are euthanized every year because there
   are not enough homes for them. The only way to make a difference in
   this tragedy is through education. To learn more about the importance
   of spaying and neutering, please read our reasons for promoting it.
   WE ARE PROUD TO HAVE ATTAINED GUIDESTAR PLATINUM STATUS.
   [platinum2.png] [Great%20Nonprofits%202018-Badge%20-hi-res.png]
   Tenth Life is also proud to be a part of the  Best Friends
   Network which is comprised of 501(c)(3) public charity rescue groups,
   spay/neuter organizations, and shelters actively saving lives and
   reducing shelter deaths on the local level with a national perspective.
   Being a part of the Network gives groups like ours all across the
   country the opportunity to work together to Save Them All.
   Tenth Life is a proud past recipient of generous funding from its
   friends at Athletes for Animals. Thanks to this award, many more cats
   have been given the lives they deserve.
