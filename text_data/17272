Discussion Paper Series 2019 #06: The politics of CSR in Japan

   What role for CSR in the change of the Japanese Corporate Governance
   System? Abstract The corporate governance (CG) system in Japan has long
   been relatively coordinated with long-term relationships between firms,
   owners and employees (Aguilera, Filatotchev, Gospel, & Jackson, 2008;
   Hall & Soskice, 2001; Yoshikawa, Tsui-Auch, & McGuire, 2007). However,
   the prevalence of non-market forms of interaction started to change in
   the late 1990s (Ahmadjian & Robbins, 2005; Jackson & Moerke, 2005),
   mostly due to a banking crisis and a discussion about the “modernity”
   of the Japanese economic system. Almost at the same time, around 2001,
   Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)...

Discussion Paper Series 2019 #05: Financialization and Institutional
Environments

   Firm-level Outcomes from a Comparative Perspective Abstract This
   conceptual paper is concerned with the outcomes of the financialization
   of non-financial firms, and particularly with the role of institutions
   in shaping these outcomes. It centers on the question of whether the
   institutional setting of economies can be expected to moderate the
   effects of financialization on companies’ employment practices,
   investment decisions, R&D activities, and value chain. To approach this
   question, I first sketch out the concept of financialization and its
   meaning when considering its firm-level implications. I then draw on
   the literature on comparative institutional theory to identify two
   opposite institutional settings,...

Discussion Paper Series 2019 #04: Differential Impact of Uncertainty on
Exporting Decision in Risk-averse and Risk-taking Firms

   Abstract Most existing literature examining the links between firm
   heterogeneity and entry into exporting assumes that firms are risk
   neutral. In this study, we relax this strict assumption that firms are
   risk neutral and introduce different attitudes of firms toward risk as
   an additional source of firm heterogeneity. In particular, we examine
   how risk attitude changes the effect of uncertainty on the decision of
   a firm to export considering the different types of uncertainty faced
   by the firm, namely, firm-specific and macroeconomic. Our analysis
   yields two interesting findings. First, firm-specific uncertainty
   discourages risk-averse firms from participating in foreign markets

“Sponge cities”: New perspectives on the progress of urban de-growth in Japan

   Sophie Buhnik (MFJ, Tokyo), member of the INCAS Project, released an
   article on “Sponge cities” in Japan on the website of the French
   Academic Network on Asian Studies (GIS Asie). In recent years,
   preventing the relative and absolute decline of small to mid-size
   cities within national urban systems has become a top priority of many
   national agendas, even in France, where high birth rates and postwar
   regional planning policies aiming at balancing territorial development
   have for a long time concealed the extent of devitalization trends in
   smaller urban areas (Béal et al. 2017). Although they are still
   perceived as places...

Discussion Paper Series 2019 #03: The Japanese Consumer Finance Market and
its Institutional Changes since the 1980s

   Abstract In this article we assert that the joint transformation of
   public perception about households’ over-indebtedness and financial
   deregulation had important implication on the government decision to
   reform the overall consumer credit between 2005 and 2010. On the one
   hand, the development of collective actions by groups of lawyers to
   defend borrowers from moneylenders’ abusive practices represents a
   source of change in the public opinion about over-indebted individuals
   in a context of long economic stagnation. A systematic press articles’
   analysis from 1977 to 2006 shows that the rising number of these
   collective actions since the early 1990s may have gradually...

Discussion Paper Series 2019 #02: Japanese Political Economy Revisited

   Abstract This introductory article to the special issue on “Japanese
   Political Economy Revisited: Diverse Corporate Change, Institutional
   Transformation, and Abenomics” starts with a short summaryof the
   changing perceptions of Japan’s political economy from its meteoric
   rise as worldwide leading model in the 1970s and 1980s to its
   demotiontoa problem and reform case since the later 1990s. Based on
   this overview, it identifies some striking issue and open questions in
   this conventional view of Japan’s political economy as problem and the
   high expectations on Abenomics as Japan’s current economic reform
   programme. Then we discuss the articles of the special issue and...

Discussion Paper Series 2019 #01: Trading Forward: The Paris Bourse in the
Nineteenth Century

   Abstract Contrary to what law and finance theory would predict, the
   Paris Bourse was highly liquid at the turn of the 20th century: the
   traded volumes amounted to four times the French GDP. This magnitude
   was mainly due to forward trading. The Bourse had developed as a
   forward market, despite a ban on forward transactions. The official
   stockbrokers played a key role in legitimizing and legalizing these
   operations, previously equated with gambling. The 1885 legalizing act
   initiated a new field of law and made possible further regulatory
   changes that paved the way for the heyday of the Paris Bourse.

Discussion Paper Series 2018 #09: Do Globalization, Deregulation and
Financialization Imply a Convergence of Contemporary Capitalisms?

   Abstract Distinctive political compromises prevailed and explained
   various brands of capitalism observed from WWII to the early 1990s. Is
   this key finding by régulation research been still valid given the wide
   diffusion of common structural changes since the 2000s: slow
   productivity in the industrialized world, overwhelming impact of
   finance, rise of inequalities within many Nation-States in response to
   deregulation, social and political polarization, open conflict between
   capitalism and democracy, the trading place between mature and emerging
   economies? These stylized facts challenge most economic theories but
   they can be explained by an institutionalist and historical approach
   that also helps in redesigning...

Discussion Paper Series 2018 #08: Competition among Securities Markets

    Abstract We study the causes and the consequences of two regulatory
   changes affecting the competition between the transparent Parquet and
   the OTC-like Coulisse markets in Paris at the turn of the 20th century.
   First, we provide evidence supporting the interest group theory to
   explain regulatory changes. By using these changes as natural
   experiments, we show then that competition widens bid-ask spreads while
   monopoly makes them narrower. These results are in line with recent
   literature questioning the effects of “dark” competition: a transparent
   monopoly could be more effective than competition if the latter
   involves opaque markets. Authors Pierre-Cyrille Hautcœur (EHESS &...

Discussion Paper Series 2018 #07: Firm-Level Labor Demand for and
Macroeconomic Increases in Non-Regular Workers in Japan

   Abstract The purpose of this study is to account for the increase in
   non-regular workers, namely, part-time and dispatched workers, in the
   Japanese economy from the early 2000s. Our contribution is that we use
   a firm-level panel dataset extracted from an administrative survey and
   distinguish between the short-run and long-run determinants of
   non-regular labor demand. Using the estimated parameters of the labor
   demand function, we decompose the rate of increase in the macroeconomic
   non-regular worker ratio into determinant factor contributions. Our
   major results can be summarized as follows. First, the firm-level
   determinants of the demand for part-time and dispatched workers...

   While the slowdown of accumulation has been at the center of the

   on the investment behavior of firms beyond the US and Europe neither in
   the case of non-leading firms.

   In this paper, the authors look back at the XIX century France to shed
   light on effect of competition in the stock exchange industry. During
   the XIX century the Paris financial centre plays a central role in the
   French financial markets. Nevertheless, six organized regional
   exchanges do exist along all the second half of the century.
