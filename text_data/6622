A Brave New World of Fossil Fuels on Demand

   Posted on January 18, 2011 by Alicia

   THE GLOBE AND MAIL INC – In September, a privately held and highly
   secretive U.S. biotech company named Joule Unlimited received a patent
   for “a proprietary organism” – a genetically adapted E. coli bacterium
   – that feeds solely on carbon dioxide and excretes liquid hydrocarbons:
   diesel fuel, jet fuel and gasoline.

   This breakthrough technology, the company says, will deliver renewable
   supplies of liquid fossil fuel almost anywhere on Earth, in essentially
   unlimited quantity and at an energy-cost equivalent of $30 (U.S.) a
   barrel of crude oil. It will deliver, the company says, “fossil fuels
   on demand.”

   We’re not talking “biofuels” – not, at any rate, in the usual sense of
   the word. The Joule technology requires no “feedstock,” no corn, no
   wood, no garbage, no algae. Aside from hungry, gene-altered
   micro-organisms, it requires only carbon dioxide and sunshine to
   manufacture crude. And water: whether fresh, brackish or salt. With
   these “inputs,” it mimics photosynthesis, the process by which green
   leaves use solar energy to convert carbon dioxide into organic
   compounds. Indeed, the company describes its manufacture of fossil
   fuels as “artificial photosynthesis.”

   Joule says it now has “a library” of fossil-fuel organisms at work in
   its Massachusetts labs, each engineered to produce a different fuel. It
   has “proven the process,” has produced ethanol (for example) at a rate
   equivalent to 10,000 U.S. gallons an acre a year. It anticipates that
   this yield could hit 25,000 gallons an acre a year when scaled for
   commercial production, equivalent to roughly 800 barrels of crude an
   acre a year.

A Brave New World of Fossil Fuels on Demand

   Posted on January 18, 2011 by Alicia

   THE GLOBE AND MAIL INC – In September, a privately held and highly
   secretive U.S. biotech company named Joule Unlimited received a patent
   for “a proprietary organism” – a genetically adapted E. coli bacterium
   – that feeds solely on carbon dioxide and excretes liquid hydrocarbons:
   diesel fuel, jet fuel and gasoline.

   This breakthrough technology, the company says, will deliver renewable
   supplies of liquid fossil fuel almost anywhere on Earth, in essentially
   unlimited quantity and at an energy-cost equivalent of $30 (U.S.) a
   barrel of crude oil. It will deliver, the company says, “fossil fuels
   on demand.”

   We’re not talking “biofuels” – not, at any rate, in the usual sense of
   the word. The Joule technology requires no “feedstock,” no corn, no
   wood, no garbage, no algae. Aside from hungry, gene-altered
   micro-organisms, it requires only carbon dioxide and sunshine to
   manufacture crude. And water: whether fresh, brackish or salt. With
   these “inputs,” it mimics photosynthesis, the process by which green
   leaves use solar energy to convert carbon dioxide into organic
   compounds. Indeed, the company describes its manufacture of fossil
   fuels as “artificial photosynthesis.”

   Joule says it now has “a library” of fossil-fuel organisms at work in
   its Massachusetts labs, each engineered to produce a different fuel. It
   has “proven the process,” has produced ethanol (for example) at a rate
   equivalent to 10,000 U.S. gallons an acre a year. It anticipates that
   this yield could hit 25,000 gallons an acre a year when scaled for
   commercial production, equivalent to roughly 800 barrels of crude an
   acre a year.
