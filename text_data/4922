National Day of Mourning

   Since 1970, Native Americans and our supporters have gathered at noon
   on Cole's Hill in Plymouth to commemorate a National Day of Mourning on
   the US thanksgiving holiday. Many Native Americans do not celebrate the
   arrival of the Pilgrims and other European settlers. Thanksgiving day
   is a reminder of the genocide of millions of Native people, the theft
   of Native lands, and the relentless assault on Native culture.
   Participants in National Day of Mourning honor Native ancestors and the
   struggles of Native peoples to survive today. It is a day of
   remembrance and spiritual connection as well as a protest of the racism
   and oppression which Native Americans continue to experience.

   50th National Day of Mourning: November 28, 2019
   12:00 Noon
   Coles Hill, Plymouth, MA
   national day of mourning

  VOLUNTEERS NEEDED:

   READ THIS! We do not know yet if we will have a full pot-luck social
   following the National Day of Mourning rally and march because we have
   not been able to obtain a hall yet this year. However, at the very
   least we will provide box lunches after the march and will as always
   need volunteers for tasks before, during and after National Day of
   Mourning. Please email info@uaine.org and put the word “Volunteer” in
   the subject line to let us know your availability.
   In particular, we often need volunteers in the Boston area in the two
   or three days before National Day of Mourning to help with food prep.
   We also need volunteers on November 29 in Plymouth. Thank you!

   WHAT IS NATIONAL DAY OF MOURNING?
   An annual tradition since 1970, Day of Mourning is a solemn, spiritual
   and highly political day. Many of us fast from sundown the day before
   through the afternoon of that day (and have a social after Day of
   Mourning so that participants in DOM can break their fasts). We are
   mourning our ancestors and the genocide of our peoples and the theft of
   our lands. It is a day when we mourn, but we also feel our strength in
   political action. Over the years, participants in Day of Mourning have
   buried Plymouth Rock a number of times, boarded the Mayflower replica,
   and placed ku klux klan sheets on the statue of William Bradford, etc.
   WHEN AND WHERE IS DAY OF MOURNING?
   Thursday, November 28, 2019 (U.S. "thanksgiving" day) at Cole's Hill,
   Plymouth, Massachusetts, 12 noon SHARP. Cole's Hill is the hill above
   Plymouth Rock in the Plymouth historic waterfront area.

   WILL THERE BE A MARCH?
   Yes, there will be a march through the historic district of Plymouth.
   Plymouth agreed, as part of the settlement of 10/19/98, that UAINE may
   march on Day of Mourning without the need for a permit as long as we
   give the town advance notice.

   PROGRAM:
   Although we very much welcome our non-Native supporters to stand with
   us, it is a day when only Indigenous people speak about our history and
   the struggles that are taking place throughout the Americas. Speakers
   will be by invitation only.
   Please note that NDOM is not a commercial event, so we ask that people
   do not sell merchandise or distribute leaflets at the outdoor program.
   If you have literature to distribute, you are welcome to place it on a
   literature table at the social hall following the speak-out and march.
   Also, we ask that you do not eat (unless you must do so for medical
   reasons) at the outdoor speak-out and march out of respect for the
   participants who are fasting. Finally, dress for the weather!

   TRANSPORTATION:
   We do not yet know if there will be chartered buses traveling to the
   National Day of Mourning from Boston and New York. Please check back
   for updates on transportation.

   National Day of Mourning Reflects on
   Thanksgiving’s Horrific, Bloody History

   Thanksgiving: A National Day of Mourning for Indians, 1998

   by Moonanum James and Mahtowin Munro
   Every year since 1970, United American Indians of New England have
   organized the National Day of Mourning observance in Plymouth at noon
   on Thanksgiving Day. Every year, hundreds of Native people and our
   supporters from all four directions join us. Every year, including this
   year, Native people from throughout the Americas will speak the truth
   about our history and about current issues and struggles we are
   involved in.
   Why do hundreds of people stand out in the cold rather than sit home
   eating turkey and watching football? Do we have something against a
   harvest festival?
   Of course not. But Thanksgiving in this country -- and in particular in
   Plymouth --is much more than a harvest home festival. It is a
   celebration of the pilgrim mythology.
   According to this mythology, the pilgrims arrived, the Native people
   fed them and welcomed them, the Indians promptly faded into the
   background, and everyone lived happily ever after.
   The truth is a sharp contrast to that mythology.

   The pilgrims are glorified and mythologized because the circumstances
   of the first English-speaking colony in Jamestown were frankly too ugly
   (for example, they turned to cannibalism to survive) to hold up as an
   effective national myth. The pilgrims did not find an empty land any
   more than Columbus "discovered" anything. Every inch of this land is
   Indian land. The pilgrims (who did not even call themselves pilgrims)
   did not come here seeking religious freedom; they already had that in
   Holland. They came here as part of a commercial venture. They
   introduced sexism, racism, anti-lesbian and gay bigotry, jails, and the
   class system to these shores. One of the very first things they did
   when they arrived on Cape Cod -- before they even made it to Plymouth
   -- was to rob Wampanoag graves at Corn Hill and steal as much of the
   Indians' winter provisions of corn and beans as they were able to
   carry. They were no better than any other group of Europeans when it
   came to their treatment of the Indigenous peoples here. And no, they
   did not even land at that sacred shrine called Plymouth Rock, a
   monument to racism and oppression which we are proud to say we buried
   in 1995.
   The first official "Day of Thanksgiving" was proclaimed in 1637 by
   Governor Winthrop. He did so to celebrate the safe return of men from
   the Massachusetts Bay Colony who had gone to Mystic, Connecticut to
   participate in the massacre of over 700 Pequot women, children, and
   men.
   About the only true thing in the whole mythology is that these pitiful
   European strangers would not have survived their first several years in
   "New England" were it not for the aid of Wampanoag people. What Native
   people got in return for this help was genocide, theft of our lands,
   and never-ending repression. We are treated either as quaint relics
   from the past, or are, to most people, virtually invisible.
   When we dare to stand up for our rights, we are considered
   unreasonable. When we speak the truth about the history of the European
   invasion, we are often told to "go back where we came from." Our roots
   are right here. They do not extend across any ocean.
   National Day of Mourning began in 1970 when a Wampanoag man, Wamsutta
   Frank James, was asked to speak at a state dinner celebrating the 350th
   anniversary of the pilgrim landing. He refused to speak false words in
   praise of the white man for bringing civilization to us poor heathens.
   Native people from throughout the Americas came to Plymouth, where they
   mourned their forebears who had been sold into slavery, burned alive,
   massacred, cheated, and mistreated since the arrival of the Pilgrims in
   1620.
   But the commemoration of National Day of Mourning goes far beyond the
   circumstances of 1970.
   Can we give thanks as we remember Native political prisoner Leonard
   Peltier, who was framed up by the FBI and has been falsely imprisoned
   since 1976? Despite mountains of evidence exonerating Peltier and the
   proven misconduct of federal prosecutors and the FBI, Peltier has been
   denied a new trial. Bill Clinton apparently does not feel that
   particular pain and has refused to grant clemency to this innocent man.
   To Native people, the case of Peltier is one more ordeal in a litany of
   wrongdoings committed by the U.S. government against us. While the
   media in New England present images of the "Pequot miracle" in
   Connecticut, the vast majority of Native people continue to live in the
   most abysmal poverty.
   Can we give thanks for the fact that, on many reservations,
   unemployment rates surpass fifty percent? Our life expectancies are
   much lower, our infant mortality and teen suicide rates much higher,
   than those of white Americans. Racist stereotypes of Native people,
   such as those perpetuated by the Cleveland Indians, the Atlanta Braves,
   and countless local and national sports teams, persist. Every single
   one of the more than 350 treaties that Native nations signed has been
   broken by the U.S. government. The bipartisan budget cuts have severely
   reduced educational opportunities for Native youth and the development
   of new housing on reservations, and have caused cause deadly cutbacks
   in health-care and other necessary services.
   Are we to give thanks for being treated as unwelcome in our own
   country?
   Or perhaps we are expected to give thanks for the war that is being
   waged by the Mexican government against Indigenous peoples there, with
   the military aid of the U.S. in the form of helicopters and other
   equipment? When the descendants of the Aztec, Maya, and Inca flee to
   the U.S., the descendants of the wash-ashore pilgrims term them
   'illegal aliens" and hunt them down.
   We object to the "Pilgrim Progress" parade and to what goes on in
   Plymouth because they are making millions of tourist dollars every year
   from the false pilgrim mythology. That money is being made off the
   backs of our slaughtered indigenous ancestors.
   Increasing numbers of people are seeking alternatives to such holidays
   as Columbus Day and Thanksgiving. They are coming to the conclusion
   that, if we are ever to achieve some sense of community, we must first
   face the truth about the history of this country and the toll that
   history has taken on the lives of millions of Indigenous, Black,
   Latino, Asian, and poor and working class white people.
   The myth of Thanksgiving, served up with dollops of European
   superiority and manifest destiny, just does not work for many people in
   this country. As Malcolm X once said about the African-American
   experience in America, "We did not land on Plymouth Rock. Plymouth Rock
   landed on us." Exactly.
