   L i s t e n  |   Hello lovelies! As it is already obvious I don't have
   much free time for blog posting the past few months, but this time I'm
   so excited I finally made it! I promise this month I'll be more active!
   So...I want to say that I'm proudly wearing my super glorious style
   statement necklace from Happiness Boutique. Bold necklaces is not
   exactly my thing, but once you find the o n e , you won't take it off!
   Happiness Boutique is full of eye candies believe me! Actually you can
   check the all statement necklaces here (there are so many!!!) and the
   bling bling earrings here, I'm pretty sure you'll find several pieces
   that suits your style. So what do you think of mine? I particularly
   enjoy wearing it with oversized t-shirts and colorful sweaters and of
   course with hats!
   Ps: Stay tuned because a small surprise for you is coming this week,
   and a lot photography posts too! I'm leaving for a small trip to London
   in a few days and I'm super excited, and I can't wait to visit my
   favourite places again. So...many, maaany photos are about to come.
   Until then find me on Instagram as lorelai_sebastian and on Snapchat as
   lo_sebastian for the updates! Cheers!
