A 10-Mile Hike to Havasu Falls was Worth the Trek for these Engagement Photos!

   Real Weddings // June 22, 2017

   Havasu Falls Engagement Havasu Falls Engagement

   Would you hike 10 miles for an engagement photo session in front of a
   crystal-blue waterfall? For Tina + Matt, the adventure was in the
   journey and the destination! Havasu Falls is an oasis deep in a desert
   canyon on the Havasupai Indian Reservation in Arizona, and, as
   photographer Anni Graham tells us, well worth every ounce of effort to
   get there. An adventurous couple requires an adventurous photographer,
   right?! T+M found that in Annie, who told us how the shoot came about:

   When Tina + Matt suggested the idea of doing their engagement session
   here, I didn’t hesitate for a second, and we went straight to work,
   sorting out permits and travel details. The location itself is no easy
   feat. Driving from LA on only a few hours of sleep, Tina + Matt met us
   at the trailhead and we hiked in 10 miles to the most breathtaking
   waterfall we could ever imagine. The water was so unbelievably blue and
   next to the red desert rocks it’s like no other place in the entire
   world. We slept out under the stars, giddy as ever to shoot the next
   day. We woke up early before the other hikers arrived and had the whole
   place to ourselves. The whole trip was such an unforgettable
   experience, and the most inspiring place to capture their love and
   spend time together. This is definitely my favorite shoot of all time.

   SO INCREDIBLE, right?! Tina shared more about her + Matt’s engagement
   and love for adventure below, alongside the beeeeeautiful images by
   Anni Graham Photography. Let’s have a look!

   On the 10-mile trek!

   Matthew and I are an adventurous kind! He grew up in the rolling hills
   of upstate New York and I, in the foothills of the Himalayas. On
   October 14th, 2 years since we met, we hiked up the frozen face of
   Whiteface Mountain in the Adirondacks. On a little geocaching
   adventure, Matthew planted a little box in the side of the face where
   he had a note that said ‘turn around’. Slowly turning, he was perched
   on a rock on one knee with the most beautiful backdrop of Lake Placid
   and mountains behind him. We were tired, wind chapped, cold, muddy, and
   huddled in Matt’s old sweatshirts: It was everything I never expected
   my proposal to be, but I couldn’t ask for anything different.

   Anni Graham was always a dream for me and growing up and looking at her
   images, it always felt like eternity when I was going to have her shoot
   my engagement photographs one day. We finally chose Havasu Falls only
   from images we had seen, and a deep desire to make this moment a
   memorable and adventurous one. We had found many beautiful places on
   the coast, but there was something exhilarating about traveling to an
   untouched part of this beautiful world to capture our love for each
   other and our love for such places together. Things fell together and
   before we knew it, we met Anni and Rich at the trailhead. It was quite
   a trek down to the falls, but one I will never forget.

   Havasu Falls Engagement Havasu Falls Engagement

   Havasu Falls Engagement Havasu Falls Engagement

   On the day of our shoot, and similar to our own proposal, Matthew and I
   ran around the falls barefoot, muddy, cold, and giddy with happiness! I
   spent days looking for the ‘perfect’ dress before the shoot, but there
   was something beautiful, simple, and just comfortable about going with
   a perfect shade of periwinkle blue (t-shirt style, of course). The
   night before, I pulled out my zip-lock bag with the 5 things I needed
   the next morning for my make-up, and slept with the highest braid to
   keep my hair-intact. I spent the morning painting my nails on the camp
   table while we ate fruit strips and laughed.

   Tina, you’re speaking our language with that cozy + cute t-shirt dress!
   We’ve got a few on rotation this summer:

   At the falls, Matthew got drenched, and my hair got frizzy, but
   everything was perfect. At the end, we stripped down to our bathing
   suits and took a big plunge into the falls together! It was the perfect
   shot, and the perfect moment where everything came full circle: we were
   remote, away from distractions, away from the business of our lives,
   simply wrapped up in each others arms, warmed by love, in a place I can
   only describe as paradise.

   Hiking 10 miles out of the canyon early the next morning, and finally
   making it back to the trailhead, I cried on our 7 hour drive back to
   Los Angeles. There was something powerful about working hard and
   deserving to see and experience places like this on earth, as well as
   having the rare opportunity of celebrating our love there: something we
   will never forget!

   Such a sweet recount of an incredible experience! Many congrats to the
   happy couple…can’t wait to see where the next adventure takes you!

A 10-Mile Hike to Havasu Falls was Worth the Trek for these Engagement Photos!

   Real Weddings // June 22, 2017

   Havasu Falls Engagement Havasu Falls Engagement

   Would you hike 10 miles for an engagement photo session in front of a
   crystal-blue waterfall? For Tina + Matt, the adventure was in the
   journey and the destination! Havasu Falls is an oasis deep in a desert
   canyon on the Havasupai Indian Reservation in Arizona, and, as
   photographer Anni Graham tells us, well worth every ounce of effort to
   get there. An adventurous couple requires an adventurous photographer,
   right?! T+M found that in Annie, who told us how the shoot came about:

   When Tina + Matt suggested the idea of doing their engagement session
   here, I didn’t hesitate for a second, and we went straight to work,
   sorting out permits and travel details. The location itself is no easy
   feat. Driving from LA on only a few hours of sleep, Tina + Matt met us
   at the trailhead and we hiked in 10 miles to the most breathtaking
   waterfall we could ever imagine. The water was so unbelievably blue and
   next to the red desert rocks it’s like no other place in the entire
   world. We slept out under the stars, giddy as ever to shoot the next
   day. We woke up early before the other hikers arrived and had the whole
   place to ourselves. The whole trip was such an unforgettable
   experience, and the most inspiring place to capture their love and
   spend time together. This is definitely my favorite shoot of all time.

   SO INCREDIBLE, right?! Tina shared more about her + Matt’s engagement
   and love for adventure below, alongside the beeeeeautiful images by
   Anni Graham Photography. Let’s have a look!

   Matthew and I are an adventurous kind! He grew up in the rolling hills
   of upstate New York and I, in the foothills of the Himalayas. On
   October 14th, 2 years since we met, we hiked up the frozen face of
   Whiteface Mountain in the Adirondacks. On a little geocaching
   adventure, Matthew planted a little box in the side of the face where
   he had a note that said ‘turn around’. Slowly turning, he was perched
   on a rock on one knee with the most beautiful backdrop of Lake Placid
   and mountains behind him. We were tired, wind chapped, cold, muddy, and
   huddled in Matt’s old sweatshirts: It was everything I never expected
   my proposal to be, but I couldn’t ask for anything different.

   Anni Graham was always a dream for me and growing up and looking at her
   images, it always felt like eternity when I was going to have her shoot
   my engagement photographs one day. We finally chose Havasu Falls only
   from images we had seen, and a deep desire to make this moment a
   memorable and adventurous one. We had found many beautiful places on
   the coast, but there was something exhilarating about traveling to an
   untouched part of this beautiful world to capture our love for each
   other and our love for such places together. Things fell together and
   before we knew it, we met Anni and Rich at the trailhead. It was quite
   a trek down to the falls, but one I will never forget.

   On the day of our shoot, and similar to our own proposal, Matthew and I
   ran around the falls barefoot, muddy, cold, and giddy with happiness! I
   spent days looking for the ‘perfect’ dress before the shoot, but there
   was something beautiful, simple, and just comfortable about going with
   a perfect shade of periwinkle blue (t-shirt style, of course). The
   night before, I pulled out my zip-lock bag with the 5 things I needed
   the next morning for my make-up, and slept with the highest braid to
   keep my hair-intact. I spent the morning painting my nails on the camp
   table while we ate fruit strips and laughed.

   Tina, you’re speaking our language with that cozy + cute t-shirt dress!
   We’ve got a few on rotation this summer:

   At the falls, Matthew got drenched, and my hair got frizzy, but
   everything was perfect. At the end, we stripped down to our bathing
   suits and took a big plunge into the falls together! It was the perfect
   shot, and the perfect moment where everything came full circle: we were
   remote, away from distractions, away from the business of our lives,
   simply wrapped up in each others arms, warmed by love, in a place I can
   only describe as paradise.

   Hiking 10 miles out of the canyon early the next morning, and finally
   making it back to the trailhead, I cried on our 7 hour drive back to
   Los Angeles. There was something powerful about working hard and
   deserving to see and experience places like this on earth, as well as
   having the rare opportunity of celebrating our love there: something we
   will never forget!

   Such a sweet recount of an incredible experience! Many congrats to the
   happy couple…can’t wait to see where the next adventure takes you!

       Wow, this seriously has to be the most beautiful engagement
       pictures ever. They must have some really good agile planning to
       put this all together with everything they will have to manage
       coming up.
