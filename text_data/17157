I Can’t Imagine A World Without Red Pandas

   July 3, 2019By RPN Staff
   Beautiful panda_Panda Guardians email header Beautiful panda_Panda
   Guardians email header

Since April of this year, nearly 70 people have joined our Panda Guardian
team—kicking off 2019 as a pivotal year for guarding red pandas from
extinction.

   ​In 2006, Red Panda Network (RPN) initiated the Red Panda Project or
   Project Punde Kundo (red panda is locally known as Punde Kundo) in the
   Panchthar-Ilam-Taplejung (PIT) Corridor of Eastern Nepal to conduct the
   first-ever monitoring ​​of red pandas in their wild habitat.

   Fourteen local people villages in Ilam and Panchthar were selected as
   the first Forest Guardians (FGs) by the Red Panda Project. The goal of
   the FG program was to engage and empower community members to safeguard
   their forests and protect a rare and endangered mammal of the
   Himalayas: the red panda.

   The goals of the FG program have not changed and has since grown to 100
   members! The program has also expanded to seven additional districts in
   Western Nepal and now extends to nearly one million acres of forest and
   50% of Nepal's red panda range.
   Words from Panda Guardian member, Veronica. Words from Panda Guardian

   This level of growth has been made possible by the generosity and
   commitment of RPN’s Panda Guardian team.

   Panda Guardian is the title given to RPN’s monthly donors. Their
   continuous support allows RPN to commit to lasting and sustainable
   conservation initiatives in red panda countries. In 2018, Panda
   Guardians raised $23,643 for red pandas and in 2019 we are on track to
   surpass this amount.

   This is huge for the FG program which is the cornerstone for RPN’s
   community-based approach and sustainable livelihood initiatives. The
   Panda Guardian team directly supports FG salaries and capacity-building
   trainings.

   “Being able to count on the support of our Panda Guardians has been
   important to our progress,” said Ang Phuri Sherpa, RPN’s Country
   Director in Nepal. “ We can now implement long-term projects and as a
   result our impact in Nepal is bigger than ever.”

   Panda Guardian members are often deeply passionate about conserving red
   pandas and get further involved in a number of ways including
   volunteering with RPN, celebrating at—and even organizing—International
   Red Panda Day events, as well as attending ecotrips in Nepal.

   “I support the Red Panda Network because of their holistic approach to
   conservation, including on-ground research and monitoring, advocacy and
   education,” says a Panda Guardian member named Veronica from Australia.
   “I especially admire their community-based conservation model,
   harnessing the knowledge and passion of local people to protect and
   enhance red panda habitat, in turn improving the livelihoods of
   communities living in those areas.”

   The model Veronica is referring to was developed in the PIT Corridor
   which is being established as the PIT Red Panda Protected Forest: the
   world’s first protected area dedicated to red pandas! This community
   conservation approach has now been replicated in Western Nepal where
   red pandas were unprotected and facing local extinction.

   “I can't imagine a world without red pandas, and I'm so grateful that
   organisations like the Red Panda Network are fighting to keep these
   beautiful and unique species in the wild,” continues Veronica.

   Of course, like Veronica, most of our recurring donors give because
   they want red pandas to be around—in the wild—for future generations.
   For their dedication to conservation, Panda Guardians now qualify for a
   15% discount at the Red Panda Store, which includes organic tea and
   earrings. We are also in the process of offering exclusive bi-monthly
   calls with the RPN field team in Nepal. These PG Conservation Calls
   will give Panda Guardian members the opportunity to ask questions and
   learn more about the conservation work their donations are supporting.

Beau King – my red panda hero

   November 9, 2010By

   We got this awesome email from Rodney King. Yes, that is his real name.
   When I saw his email I thought it was a fake email, but after opening
   and reading it I was not only surprised, but inspired by his son,
   Beau’s, beautiful face.
   Beau asked his dad Rodney to send this to me. Could I have a better job
   in the world that to get photos of beautiful children like Beau.

   Beau goes to a weekly class at the Birmingham Zoo. This photo was taken
   after a class that highlighted Red Pandas. On the day that he went
   there was a classroom lesson, a trip inside the zoo to look at the red
   panda and the zookeeper gave even more info on the 2 red pandas at the
   zoo.
   Beau asked his dad to send me this photo.

   Beau you are my Red Panda Hero…Thanks for the inspiration.
