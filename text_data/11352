STORY HIGHLIGHTS

     * By 2020, Nicaragua expects to produce 90% of its energy from clean,
       safe sources
     __________________________________________________________________

   Nicaragua is what many experts call a paradise of renewable energies:
   extensive geothermic resources – resulting from its large volcanic
   chain and seismic activity--, with excellent exposure to the wind and
   sun and a variety of water sources.

   In terms of energy output, the country has the capacity to generate
   5,800 megawatts (MW) annually from clean sources. Currently, however,
   just over 5% of its renewable potential has been developed.

   Paradoxically, Nicaragua was until recently dependent on oil-based
   products, which were expensive and far from environmentally friendly.
   This was in addition to limited power lines and one of the highest
   electricity rates in the region at an average rate of US$ 0.24 per
   kilowatt/hour.

   In 2006, this scenario led the Nicaraguan government to address the
   need to change its electrical grid. With the government’s openness
   toward private investment, 58% of the country’s energy is currently
   produced by renewable sources whereas the remaining 42% comes from
   oil-based bunker fuel, according to estimates of the Nicaraguan
   Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM). In the region, Nicaragua is second
   only to Costa Rica in terms of the share- 21%- of renewable,
   non-hydraulic energy in the region. The energy output of its geothermic
   resources is considered the best in Central America, with estimated
   potential reserves of 1,500 MW (in addition to the country’s energy
   system capacity, which is 1,300 MW). However, just 154 MW have been
   installed by the country’s power plants, Polaris and Momotombo.

   What is geothermic energy?

   Imagine large water reservoirs hundreds of kilometers deep that come
   into contact with magma. The resulting steam produced needs to escape,
   for which reason one can see large columns of steam shooting skyward in
   some areas. Geothermic plants channel that steam to generators and when
   the water cools it returns to the depths. That is why it is an
   inexhaustible source of clean energy.

   According to World Bank experts, geothermal energy can be a relatively
   inexpensive source of electricity, especially compared with fossil
   fuels. “The generation of this type of energy is not only important for
   its positive effects on the economy, but also for its reduction of GEI
   emissions by almost 80,000 tons,” said Hasan Tuluy, World Bank
   vice-president for Latin America and the Caribbean, during a visit to
   the Polaris plant on October 22. “This project will mean a savings of
   US$ 88 million for the country through the reduction in oil imports. We
   will substitute the bunker fuel consumed in Nicaragua with clean,
   renewable energy,” said Alejandro Arguello, head of corporate
   development at Polaris, during the visit.

   With the idea that the Polaris power plant in San Jacinto, in León
   Department, will supply nearly 20% of Nicaragua’s energy needs, the
   International Finance Corporation (IFC) partially financed the US$450
   million, 72MW plant.

   Wind farms

   Nicaragua is also focusing on another renewable energy source: wind.
   Huge white windmills erected on wind farms can be seen along many of
   the country’s roads.

   On the banks of Lake Cocibolca, in Rivas Department, is the country’s
   third wind plant, Eolo. This month, thanks to a US$ 110 million
   investment, 22 wind turbines will officially begin operation, providing
   some 44MW of energy to the national network. It is estimated that Eolo
   will not require any fossil fuel supply.

   It is estimated that at least 200 million women and girls in the world
   have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM). The practice does not
   provide any health benefits, but rather causes serious risks for
   women’s health including chronic infections and pain, menstrual
   problems, and complications in child birth. The data shows that in at
   least 10 countries more than 65 percent of women ages 15-49 years have
   undergone FGM. Read More.

   The world made remarkable progress in child survival between 1990 and
   2018. The under-5 mortality rate—the probability of a child dying
   between birth and his or her 5th birthday—fell by over 50% to 39 deaths
   per 1,000 live births. Mortality among children of ages 5-14 years also
   fell by over 50% to 7 deaths per 1,000 children. The reduction in the
   under-5 mortality rate has accelerated and nearly doubled since 2000.
   It now declines by 3.8% annually, compared to 2% between 1990 and 2000.

   Water subsidies disproportionately benefit higher-income households—a
   result consistent across the 10 countries analyzed in the recent World
   Bank report, Doing More With Less - Smarter Subsidies for Water Supply
   and Sanitation.


   Across the 10 countries analyzed—Ethiopia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria,
   Uganda, El Salvador, Jamaica, Panama, Bangladesh, and Vietnam—existing
   subsidies tended to target networked services. Since many poorer
   households rely on water and sanitation access that are not connected
   to their homes, there is a disproportionate focus of existing subsidies
   that benefit wealthier families. Read More.

   The percentage of people with cell phone subscriptions is now higher
   than those using sanitation services. In 2000, only 12% of the global
   population had mobile phone subscriptions. In 2015, the rate is near
   97% — a trend consistent across world regions.


   These increases in cell phone users far exceed the number of people
   using at least basic sanitation services, which encompass improved
   sanitation facilities that are not shared with other households. In
   2015, approximately 70% of the global population used at least basic
   sanitation services — a rate that only increased by 10 percentage
   points in the last 15 years. Read More.

   It is estimated that at least 200 million women and girls in the world
   have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM). The practice does not
   provide any health benefits, but rather causes serious risks for
   women’s health including chronic infections and pain, menstrual
   problems, and complications in child birth. The data shows that in at
   least 10 countries more than 65 percent of women ages 15-49 years have
   undergone FGM. Read More.

   The world made remarkable progress in child survival between 1990 and
   2018. The under-5 mortality rate—the probability of a child dying
   between birth and his or her 5th birthday—fell by over 50% to 39 deaths
   per 1,000 live births. Mortality among children of ages 5-14 years also
   fell by over 50% to 7 deaths per 1,000 children. The reduction in the
   under-5 mortality rate has accelerated and nearly doubled since 2000.
   It now declines by 3.8% annually, compared to 2% between 1990 and 2000.

   Water subsidies disproportionately benefit higher-income households—a
   result consistent across the 10 countries analyzed in the recent World
   Bank report, Doing More With Less - Smarter Subsidies for Water Supply
   and Sanitation.


   Across the 10 countries analyzed—Ethiopia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria,
   Uganda, El Salvador, Jamaica, Panama, Bangladesh, and Vietnam—existing
   subsidies tended to target networked services. Since many poorer
   households rely on water and sanitation access that are not connected
   to their homes, there is a disproportionate focus of existing subsidies
   that benefit wealthier families. Read More.

   The percentage of people with cell phone subscriptions is now higher
   than those using sanitation services. In 2000, only 12% of the global
   population had mobile phone subscriptions. In 2015, the rate is near
   97% — a trend consistent across world regions.


   These increases in cell phone users far exceed the number of people
   using at least basic sanitation services, which encompass improved
   sanitation facilities that are not shared with other households. In
   2015, approximately 70% of the global population used at least basic
   sanitation services — a rate that only increased by 10 percentage
   points in the last 15 years. Read More.

   World Bank Group
     __________________________________________________________________

   WASHINGTON, March 19, 2018 - The worsening impacts of climate change in
   three densely populated regions of the world could see over 140 million
   people move within their countries’ borders by 2050, creating a looming
   human crisis and threatening the development process, a new World Bank
   Group report finds

   But with concerted action - including global efforts to cut greenhouse
   gas emissions and robust development planning at the country level –
   this worst-case scenario of over 140m could be dramatically reduced, by
   as much as 80 percent, or more than 100 million people.

   The report, Groundswell – Preparing for Internal Climate Migration, is
   the first and most comprehensive study of its kind to focus on the
   nexus between slow-onset climate change impacts, internal migration
   patterns and, development in three developing regions of the world:
   Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America.

   It finds that unless urgent climate and development action is taken
   globally and nationally, these three regions together could be dealing
   with tens of millions of internal climate migrants by 2050. These are
   people forced to move from increasingly non-viable areas of their
   countries due to growing problems like water scarcity, crop failure,
   sea-level rise and storm surges.

   These “climate migrants” would be additional to the millions of people
   already moving within their countries for economic, social, political
   or other reasons, the report warns.

   World Bank Chief Executive Officer Kristalina Georgieva said the new
   research provides a wake-up call to countries and development
   institutions.

   “We have a small window now, before the effects of climate change
   deepen, to prepare the ground for this new reality,” Georgieva said.
   “Steps cities take to cope with the upward trend of arrivals from rural
   areas and to improve opportunities for education, training and jobs
   will pay long-term dividends. It’s also important to help people make
   good decisions about whether to stay where they are or move to new
   locations where they are less vulnerable.”

   The research team, led by World Bank Lead Environmental Specialist
   Kanta Kumari Rigaud and including researchers and modelers from CIESIN
   Columbia University, CUNY Institute of Demographic Research, and the
   Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research - applied a
   multi-dimensional modeling approach to estimate the potential scale of
   internal climate migration across the three regions.

   They looked at three potential climate change and development
   scenarios, comparing the most “pessimistic” (high greenhouse gas
   emissions and unequal development paths), to “climate friendly” and
   “more inclusive development” scenarios in which climate and national
   development action increases in line with the challenge. Across each
   scenario, they applied demographic, socioeconomic and climate impact
   data at a 14-square kilometer grid-cell level to model likely shifts in
   population within countries.

   This approach identified major “hotspots” of climate in- and
   out-migration - areas from which people are expected to move and urban,
   peri-urban and rural areas to which people will try to move to build
   new lives and livelihoods.

   “Without the right planning and support, people migrating from rural
   areas into cities could be facing new and even more dangerous risks,”
   said the report’s team lead Kanta Kumari Rigaud. “We could see
   increased tensions and conflict as a result of pressure on scarce
   resources. But that doesn’t have to be the future. While internal
   climate migration is becoming a reality, it won’t be a crisis if we
   plan for it now.”

   The report recommends key actions nationally and globally, including:
     * Cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to reduce climate pressure
       on people and livelihoods, and to reduce the overall scale of
       climate migration
     * Transforming development planning to factor in the entire cycle of
       climate migration (before, during and after migration)
     * Investing in data and analysis to improve understanding of internal
       climate migration trends and trajectories at the country level.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS

     * By 2020, Nicaragua expects to produce 90% of its energy from clean,
       safe sources
     __________________________________________________________________

   Nicaragua is what many experts call a paradise of renewable energies:
   extensive geothermic resources – resulting from its large volcanic
   chain and seismic activity--, with excellent exposure to the wind and
   sun and a variety of water sources.

   In terms of energy output, the country has the capacity to generate
   5,800 megawatts (MW) annually from clean sources. Currently, however,
   just over 5% of its renewable potential has been developed.

   Paradoxically, Nicaragua was until recently dependent on oil-based
   products, which were expensive and far from environmentally friendly.
   This was in addition to limited power lines and one of the highest
   electricity rates in the region at an average rate of US$ 0.24 per
   kilowatt/hour.

   In 2006, this scenario led the Nicaraguan government to address the
   need to change its electrical grid. With the government’s openness
   toward private investment, 58% of the country’s energy is currently
   produced by renewable sources whereas the remaining 42% comes from
   oil-based bunker fuel, according to estimates of the Nicaraguan
   Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM). In the region, Nicaragua is second
   only to Costa Rica in terms of the share- 21%- of renewable,
   non-hydraulic energy in the region. The energy output of its geothermic
   resources is considered the best in Central America, with estimated
   potential reserves of 1,500 MW (in addition to the country’s energy
   system capacity, which is 1,300 MW). However, just 154 MW have been
   installed by the country’s power plants, Polaris and Momotombo.

   What is geothermic energy?

   Imagine large water reservoirs hundreds of kilometers deep that come
   into contact with magma. The resulting steam produced needs to escape,
   for which reason one can see large columns of steam shooting skyward in
   some areas. Geothermic plants channel that steam to generators and when
   the water cools it returns to the depths. That is why it is an
   inexhaustible source of clean energy.

   According to World Bank experts, geothermal energy can be a relatively
   inexpensive source of electricity, especially compared with fossil
   fuels. “The generation of this type of energy is not only important for
   its positive effects on the economy, but also for its reduction of GEI
   emissions by almost 80,000 tons,” said Hasan Tuluy, World Bank
   vice-president for Latin America and the Caribbean, during a visit to
   the Polaris plant on October 22. “This project will mean a savings of
   US$ 88 million for the country through the reduction in oil imports. We
   will substitute the bunker fuel consumed in Nicaragua with clean,
   renewable energy,” said Alejandro Arguello, head of corporate
   development at Polaris, during the visit.

   With the idea that the Polaris power plant in San Jacinto, in León
   Department, will supply nearly 20% of Nicaragua’s energy needs, the
   International Finance Corporation (IFC) partially financed the US$450
   million, 72MW plant.

   Wind farms

   Nicaragua is also focusing on another renewable energy source: wind.
   Huge white windmills erected on wind farms can be seen along many of
   the country’s roads.

   On the banks of Lake Cocibolca, in Rivas Department, is the country’s
   third wind plant, Eolo. This month, thanks to a US$ 110 million
   investment, 22 wind turbines will officially begin operation, providing
   some 44MW of energy to the national network. It is estimated that Eolo
   will not require any fossil fuel supply.

   It is estimated that at least 200 million women and girls in the world
   have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM). The practice does not
   provide any health benefits, but rather causes serious risks for
   women’s health including chronic infections and pain, menstrual
   problems, and complications in child birth. The data shows that in at
   least 10 countries more than 65 percent of women ages 15-49 years have
   undergone FGM. Read More.

   The world made remarkable progress in child survival between 1990 and
   2018. The under-5 mortality rate—the probability of a child dying
   between birth and his or her 5th birthday—fell by over 50% to 39 deaths
   per 1,000 live births. Mortality among children of ages 5-14 years also
   fell by over 50% to 7 deaths per 1,000 children. The reduction in the
   under-5 mortality rate has accelerated and nearly doubled since 2000.
   It now declines by 3.8% annually, compared to 2% between 1990 and 2000.

   Water subsidies disproportionately benefit higher-income households—a
   result consistent across the 10 countries analyzed in the recent World
   Bank report, Doing More With Less - Smarter Subsidies for Water Supply
   and Sanitation.


   Across the 10 countries analyzed—Ethiopia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria,
   Uganda, El Salvador, Jamaica, Panama, Bangladesh, and Vietnam—existing
   subsidies tended to target networked services. Since many poorer
   households rely on water and sanitation access that are not connected
   to their homes, there is a disproportionate focus of existing subsidies
   that benefit wealthier families. Read More.

   The percentage of people with cell phone subscriptions is now higher
   than those using sanitation services. In 2000, only 12% of the global
   population had mobile phone subscriptions. In 2015, the rate is near
   97% — a trend consistent across world regions.


   These increases in cell phone users far exceed the number of people
   using at least basic sanitation services, which encompass improved
   sanitation facilities that are not shared with other households. In
   2015, approximately 70% of the global population used at least basic
   sanitation services — a rate that only increased by 10 percentage
   points in the last 15 years. Read More.

   It is estimated that at least 200 million women and girls in the world
   have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM). The practice does not
   provide any health benefits, but rather causes serious risks for
   women’s health including chronic infections and pain, menstrual
   problems, and complications in child birth. The data shows that in at
   least 10 countries more than 65 percent of women ages 15-49 years have
   undergone FGM. Read More.

   The world made remarkable progress in child survival between 1990 and
   2018. The under-5 mortality rate—the probability of a child dying
   between birth and his or her 5th birthday—fell by over 50% to 39 deaths
   per 1,000 live births. Mortality among children of ages 5-14 years also
   fell by over 50% to 7 deaths per 1,000 children. The reduction in the
   under-5 mortality rate has accelerated and nearly doubled since 2000.
   It now declines by 3.8% annually, compared to 2% between 1990 and 2000.

   Water subsidies disproportionately benefit higher-income households—a
   result consistent across the 10 countries analyzed in the recent World
   Bank report, Doing More With Less - Smarter Subsidies for Water Supply
   and Sanitation.


   Across the 10 countries analyzed—Ethiopia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria,
   Uganda, El Salvador, Jamaica, Panama, Bangladesh, and Vietnam—existing
   subsidies tended to target networked services. Since many poorer
   households rely on water and sanitation access that are not connected
   to their homes, there is a disproportionate focus of existing subsidies
   that benefit wealthier families. Read More.

   The percentage of people with cell phone subscriptions is now higher
   than those using sanitation services. In 2000, only 12% of the global
   population had mobile phone subscriptions. In 2015, the rate is near
   97% — a trend consistent across world regions.


   These increases in cell phone users far exceed the number of people
   using at least basic sanitation services, which encompass improved
   sanitation facilities that are not shared with other households. In
   2015, approximately 70% of the global population used at least basic
   sanitation services — a rate that only increased by 10 percentage
   points in the last 15 years. Read More.

   World Bank Group
     __________________________________________________________________

   WASHINGTON, March 19, 2018 - The worsening impacts of climate change in
   three densely populated regions of the world could see over 140 million
   people move within their countries’ borders by 2050, creating a looming
   human crisis and threatening the development process, a new World Bank
   Group report finds

   But with concerted action - including global efforts to cut greenhouse
   gas emissions and robust development planning at the country level –
   this worst-case scenario of over 140m could be dramatically reduced, by
   as much as 80 percent, or more than 100 million people.

   The report, Groundswell – Preparing for Internal Climate Migration, is
   the first and most comprehensive study of its kind to focus on the
   nexus between slow-onset climate change impacts, internal migration
   patterns and, development in three developing regions of the world:
   Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America.

   It finds that unless urgent climate and development action is taken
   globally and nationally, these three regions together could be dealing
   with tens of millions of internal climate migrants by 2050. These are
   people forced to move from increasingly non-viable areas of their
   countries due to growing problems like water scarcity, crop failure,
   sea-level rise and storm surges.

   These “climate migrants” would be additional to the millions of people
   already moving within their countries for economic, social, political
   or other reasons, the report warns.

   World Bank Chief Executive Officer Kristalina Georgieva said the new
   research provides a wake-up call to countries and development
   institutions.

   “We have a small window now, before the effects of climate change
   deepen, to prepare the ground for this new reality,” Georgieva said.
   “Steps cities take to cope with the upward trend of arrivals from rural
   areas and to improve opportunities for education, training and jobs
   will pay long-term dividends. It’s also important to help people make
   good decisions about whether to stay where they are or move to new
   locations where they are less vulnerable.”

   The research team, led by World Bank Lead Environmental Specialist
   Kanta Kumari Rigaud and including researchers and modelers from CIESIN
   Columbia University, CUNY Institute of Demographic Research, and the
   Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research - applied a
   multi-dimensional modeling approach to estimate the potential scale of
   internal climate migration across the three regions.

   They looked at three potential climate change and development
   scenarios, comparing the most “pessimistic” (high greenhouse gas
   emissions and unequal development paths), to “climate friendly” and
   “more inclusive development” scenarios in which climate and national
   development action increases in line with the challenge. Across each
   scenario, they applied demographic, socioeconomic and climate impact
   data at a 14-square kilometer grid-cell level to model likely shifts in
   population within countries.

   This approach identified major “hotspots” of climate in- and
   out-migration - areas from which people are expected to move and urban,
   peri-urban and rural areas to which people will try to move to build
   new lives and livelihoods.

   “Without the right planning and support, people migrating from rural
   areas into cities could be facing new and even more dangerous risks,”
   said the report’s team lead Kanta Kumari Rigaud. “We could see
   increased tensions and conflict as a result of pressure on scarce
   resources. But that doesn’t have to be the future. While internal
   climate migration is becoming a reality, it won’t be a crisis if we
   plan for it now.”

   The report recommends key actions nationally and globally, including:
     * Cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to reduce climate pressure
       on people and livelihoods, and to reduce the overall scale of
       climate migration
     * Transforming development planning to factor in the entire cycle of
       climate migration (before, during and after migration)
     * Investing in data and analysis to improve understanding of internal
       climate migration trends and trajectories at the country level.

   Ending Learning Poverty: A Target to Galvanize Action on Literacy

   A global learning crisis threatens countries’ efforts to build human
   capital and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A new
   concept—learning poverty—aims to draw attention to this issue, and how
   to defeat it.

   Between 2000 and 2015, the number of people living in extreme poverty
   declined by a total of 802 million in the 15 countries with the highest
   poverty-reduction rates, according to new analysis of World Bank
   poverty data. In each of these countries, an average of at least 1.6%
   of the population moved out of extreme poverty every year. While
   extreme poverty remains endemic in low-income and conflict-affected
   countries, seven of the top 15 countries are in Africa, and two are on
   the World Bank Group’s Harmonized List of Fragile Situations for
   FY19. Read More.

   Some 53% of children in low- and middle-income countries experience
   “learning poverty” – meaning they are unable to read and understand
   simple text by age 10.  To spur progress, the World Bank set a new
   target to cut “learning poverty” in half by 2030. Achieving this goal
   would require a “near tripling” of the current rate of progress and
   would still leave a learning poverty rate of 27%. But under a “business
   as usual scenario,” learning poverty would only fall to 43% by 2030,
   according to a new report, Ending Learning Poverty: What will it take?

   The global forecast for oil production in 2019 has been repeatedly
   revised downward over the last year and a half amid weakening demand
   for oil. Growth in demand  is now around 1%, or 1 million barrels per
   day – the weakest growth rate since 2012, according to the October 2019
   Commodity Markets Outlook. Oil prices are projected to average $60/bbl
   in 2019 and are forecast to weaken to $58/bbl in 2020, $7/bbl lower
   than the previous forecast. The downward revision reflects the weaker
   outlook for global growth and therefore for oil demand. Oil consumption
   growth is expected to increase slightly next year at a level usually
   associated with global downturns. If economic growth deteriorates
   further, oil demand could be substantially weaker, says the report.

   The cost of starting a business in low- and middle-income countries has
   fallen from 141.75% of per capita income in 1990, to 25.25% today,
   according to the World Bank’s Doing Business report, now in its 17^th
   year. Since the report’s inception, 178 economies have implemented 722
   reforms in the area of starting a business, reducing or eliminating
   barriers to entry. Despite such improvements, considerable gaps still
   exist between developed and developing economies on most Doing Business
   indicators. Read more.
