   Decision support

   Decision-making support for devising powerful strategies

   To gain a business advantage, it’s essential to conduct a competitive
   landscape analysis and map shifting trends. Our analytics reports do
   just that. We harness knowledge to provide an unbiased picture and the
   resources for driving informed decision-making, devising product
   development strategies, identifying new marketing opportunities and
   generating sales leads.
   Measurable returns

   A huge time saver

   Finding the right methodology or expert in a specialist field is always
   challenging and time consuming. This task is made much quicker and
   simpler with the help of our cognitive analytics tools which map and
   decipher how data sources are connected. They also benchmark research
   activities and deliver smart meta insights for optimizing R&D resources
   and drug discovery.

   An integrated, multi-purpose solution

   omicX has developed an integrated multi-entry point ecosystem. It is
   designed to cross all department and corporate boundaries, delivering a
   wide variety of meaningful insights or competitive intelligence. This,
   coupled with our unique methodology and analytics, means we can deliver
   multi-purpose, reports for use in bioinformatics, R&D, marketing and
   strategy development.

   Leveraging information is all about getting data to talk

   Identifying the most appropriate computational protocols can take
   millions of research dollars. To save precious resources and speed up
   therapy development by weeks or even months, omicX has developed AI
   assistants that are trained to read scientific papers and work out
   which computational protocols or tool combinations were used. The omicX
   search engine is unlike traditional search engines, being built by
   scientists, for scientists. It makes use of proprietary machine
   learning models built from manually curated data templates to associate
   protocols with medical or experimental contexts.

   Its strength lies in the fact that it can also be used to track the
   latest hot protocols and remain at the forefront of scientific
   breakthroughs.
   Les Echos

   France's business daily

   A precious tool and considerable time-saver for researchers.
   Sciences et Avenir

   France's top monthly science magazine

   It's a little like Waze or Google Maps but applied to scientific
   discovery and boosted by scientific reasoning. Over time, one can
   imagine the platform becoming a hub for researchers and a scientific
   assistant which can see and sound out the evolution of scientific
   knowledge in real-time.
   Usbek & Rica

   A new technology news site

   It's with great pride that the start-up explains how its users can
   reduce research time– up to several months – and costs. It democratizes
   research by doing away with the need for scientists to acquire coding
   skills to conduct bioinformatics analyses.
