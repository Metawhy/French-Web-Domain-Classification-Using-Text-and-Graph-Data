WASHING DRUMS

   I’ve been living in the same street in Munich for 15 years now. In the
   beginning I didn’t have my own washing machine so I had to go over
   street to do my laundry for quiet some time. I’ve always liked to go
   there and have some time to watch people doing their stuff and to
   listen to music.

   The place that I went to was kind of left over 60’s style but was also
   mixed up with some elements  of the 80’s. I always wanted to shoot it
   and when I finally took the time to do it I really couldn’t come up
   with something that caught the atmosphere of the place and that I
   liked. The only thing that kind of hit me was a shot of a washing drum.
   I have never paid attention to washing drums before but now I decided t
   make it a small series – and here it is.

ABSTRACT MOUNTAIN

   Living in Bavaria near to the mountains gives me the chance to go to
   the mountains whenever I want. I’ve always been fascinated by the
   structures mother nature creates in the mountains of the alps. When
   they are still snowy but the water already begins to melt slowly in
   spring time it creates amazing patterns with mind blowing contrasts.

   During the last couple of years I’ve been traveling a lot on my
   motorbikes to capture these fascinating structures of the Bavarian,
   Italian and Austrian Mountains.

PIPES

   I started to shoot this series about church pipe organs in 2017. I had
   the initial idea of shooting a series like this back in 2008. I
   actually won a price with a picture of a church pipe organ and in a way
   it was a milestone for my career as a photographer because I ended up
   with a contract with a gallery

PHNOM PENH NIGHTS II

   Back in the 70s Phnom Penh had a population of 2-3 million people.
   After the Khmer Rouge took over the city was almost abandoned and the
   population went down as low as 20000 people. This all happened within
   one week. After four years the Khmer Rouge were driven out of Phnom
   Penh by the Vietnamese in 1979, and people began to return to the city.
   The population today is about 1.5 million people.

   This series tries to picture an abandoned Phnom Penh. It’s the way that
   I imagine how it looked like in the 70s after most of the people were
   forced to leave their homes.

   Thanks to my friend  „Meng“ who took me around in his Tuktuk at night
   time and kept me safe!

BANGKOK FROM ABOVE

   When I went to Bangkok in 2011 I had not a single clue what my photo
   project would look like this time. I was sure that I didn't want to do
   the classical street photography because at that time I didn't want to
   shoot portraits due to the fact that they are always very emotional. I
   wanted to create a project for my portfolio that follows my very
   graphical approach but at the same time shows the daily life in
   Bangkok. I ended up with a birds eye view series where It's all about
   patterns and objects - no faces but city life situations ...

   Lately (2018) I had the chance to return to Bangkok to continue to work
   on my BTS series that I started in 2011.

   This is a sum up of the shots I took.

TWO WHEELS GOOD

   The motorbike part dealers of Phnom Penh

   The best way to get around in Cambodia is a motorbike or a scooter.
   When you´re in Phnom Penh there are bikes everyhere. The most popular
   model is probably the Honda Dream - a 125cc bike that most of the
   TukTuk drivers have in use due to its reliability. Anything that drives
   seems to be fine -  as long as the engine is runnig it will be out
   there on the streets.

   Well, if the engine is not running people need to get parts for their
   bikes and the motorbike part dealers on the Russian market in Phnom
   Penh is the hot spot for anyything you might possibly need to get back
   on the road again.

   In 2018 I spent some weeks in Phnom Penh and shot a photo series of
   these people.

KNEEL AND PRAY

   Traveling the southern states of the USA gave me clear sense how much
   people care about god. Although it's not my kind of thing I loved the
   bill boards that I saw along the way. One thing is for sure - god gives
   me 86,400 seconds everyday and from now on I spend some of them
   thinking of him.

AFTER THE FLOOD

   Lake Forggensee is a barrier lake that was built in 1954 in Bavaria.
   It’s Bavaria’s 5th biggest lake. In 2018 the lake was drained and not
   refilled in order to fix the damn.

   I took some rides out on my motorbike to take some shots. It really
   reminded me of deserts after a flood. The cracks in the ground, the dry
   and abandoned looking surroundings, and, the wide open space.

BOWLING ALLEYS

   For a couple of years I've been trying to find the most exciting
   bowling alleys and "Kegelbahnen" in Southern Germany. Kegeln is pretty
   similar to bowling but with only nine pins, smaller balls, and shorter
   lanes. It used to be a big thing in Germany in the 60's, 70's and 80's.
   These days thsi sport is not en vogue anymore and it seems that mostly
   older people go these "Kegelbahnen".

LOOKING DOWN ON MUNICH

   I shot this series for CANON EUROPE for their "Come and See" marketing
   campaign. The idea behind the campaign was to get different
   photographers to shoot their city they way they want to see it. I
   decided to go for street photography in a way that wouldn't show faces.
   That way the people in these pictures become graphical elements. The
   viewer won't have a clear idea of the mood the person in the picture is
   in. It's up to you to make your own story about the situation.

POOLS

   Before I started this series in 2011 swimming pools where something
   loud, crowded and steamy to me. Screaming kids, coughing people,
   splashing water - a nightmare in my eyes. In my series “POOLS” I
   pictured these places as super quiet locations. No people, flat water,
   nothing moves. With the reflecting water these places turn out to be
   like mandalas  –  it’s like a visual meditation in a way.

FILL'ER UP

   I traveled through the southern states of the USA from Washington DC to
   Virgina, West Virgina, North Carolina, Tennessee. 2200 miles on the
   road and the burning sun with me. Along the way I captured these mostly
   abandoned gas stations. Many of them were shut down due to financial
   reasons because these days people travel on the intersates and not on
   the small highways anymore. Some of them have been sitting there for a
   couple of decades and I assume they will sit there until a hurricane or
   something else tears them down.

PEOPLE OF THE SOUTH

   On my way from Washington DC to Nashville, Tennessee I drove about 2200
   miles in 2 weeks. This trip gave me the chance to experience both -
   country and people. It seems that everything is about tradition and
   cars in the south. You will hardly find a village without a store for
   used tires or old pick up truck on the side of the road. Southern
   hospitality is not a cliché – it's one of the reasons that make the
   South one of my favorite places in the world.

   K. had a flat tire and asked me if I could help him out with a phone.
   Since I was traveling and I didin't charge my phone I couldnt help him
   out. So I deciced that we get that flat tire off together so that I
   could drive him down to the village to get it fixed. Kenny has been
   driving his Ford truck for over 40 years. His number one band is Lynyrd
   Skynyrd and we were rocking out together on our way to the garage while
   we were listening to "Free Bird" turned up to 10 and had a cold diet
   Dr. Pepper. Thanks for a great story Kenny!

   This is the whole crew of Kellis' "Sword's Used Cars" garage and a they
   are all good friends of Kenny (the guy with the flat tire). What a
   great experience to meet these guys. The beer I had there was for sure
   among the top ten in my life. The location was simply stunning. I
   thought it's a good idea not to mention ZZ Top because I really didn't
   know if they are into that kind of jokes.

   Kellis is the boss at "Sword's Used Cars". I got there when I drove
   Kenny to get this flat tire fixed. In the beginning I was a bit unsure
   what to think of him 'cause he was playing with these keys the whole
   time and somehow it seemed aggressive to me. He turned out to be the
   nicest guy. After a short chat he even gave me his business card so
   that I could catch up with him if I should ever run into any trouble.

   Remember when I met Kenny, the guy with the flat tire and the old Ford
   truck? When I drove him down to the valley to get his tire fixed we
   ended up at “Sword’s Used Cars” in Sneedville. I don’t know what this
   guy was called because he didn’t say a single word while I was there. I
   also don’t know what his agenda was in there - I guess he’s been
   hanging around in this place for a really long time just sitting and
   drinking coke. From time to time he was chuckling a bit when the boss
   made fun of me. Anyway, it was a great place to be and fun people to
   hang out with and I felt like I was part of a Coen brother’s movie.
   Keep up the good work guys!
   Matt, Wilkesboro, North Carolina.
   Matt, Wilkesboro, North Carolina.

   I met Matt when I stopped on the side of the road to take photos of an
   abandoned gas station next to his garage. The Car in the back is a '71
   Ford Mustang that he bought brand new when he was a young man. It was
   his first car and he kept it all the years until today. Now that he
   retired he's working on it to restore it. I wish I could see it when
   it's finished. All I know, it's going to be yellow like it was brand
   new.

   When I first came to Matt's place he was sitting there staring at the
   road and wataching the cars pass. He seemed a bit desperate but I
   figured out that he simply was tired and a quiet person anyway.
   Bob, Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina
   Bob, Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina

   I met Bob somewhere along my way in the Blue Ridge Mountains. He was
   unloading wood from his truck. He’s been drving this truck for over 40
   years and he told me how to keep it running. “It’s very important to
   check on the oil quiet often because it tends to leak a bit. Well, I
   guess it’s nothing that’s not gonna happen to me at some point, right?
   We’re all getting older, buddy.”

   John Wise, Nashville, Tennessee
   John Wise, Nashville, Tennessee

   I met John in Robert's Western World, a honky tonk bar on the Nashville
   Broadway. We had a chat about this and that and when I asked him to
   take a photo of him he accidentally spilled his coffee. His hands are a
   bit shaky due to a stroke he had a couple of years ago. He wouldn't let
   me buy him a new coffee because he said he already had too much coffee
   anyway. A very nice man and a real life cowboy!
   John & Lois Shepherd, Nashville, Tennessee
   John & Lois Shepherd, Nashville, Tennessee

   John is a living country legend. He’s been playing on the Nashville
   broadway for more than 40 years. I had the pleasure to see him in
   Robert’s Western World and he played one of my favorite Hank Williams
   songs: “Hey good lookin’ ”. In the early years of his career he played
   shows together with his wife Lois. She’s not on the stage anymore but
   she’s always around supporting him like she did all her life since they
   got married. John’s biggest hit was probably the song “If you got the
   time, we got the beer” for Miller Beers.
   Bonnie, Harriman, Tennessee
   Bonnie, Harriman, Tennessee

   I met her when I did a u-turn on the highway because the building
   looked really interesting. "Bonny & Clyde Antiques and Collectibles"
   said the sign and I was wondering what kind of people I would meet
   inside. From the outside I could see a lot of confederations flags in
   all kinds of makes - stickers, real flags, prints on number plates...
   Being inside was weird at first but after a while we started to chat.
   Straight away it started out with "the flag" as a topic and how
   different their country got since Obama is president. A real ice
   breaker was the fact that they sold a book that was written in German
   but they didn't have a clou what it was about so I had to translate it.
   It was a religious kids story from about 1890. When I left Bonnie gave
   me a bird houseas a present  that she made! Politically we're really
   not on the same page but I enjoyed the experience to meet you anyway -
   thanks guys!

   Greg, Danville, Virgina

   Greg is a young man who was raised by his grandmother. He didn't tell
   me why his real parents couldn't take care of him. In his younger years
   he had lots of trouble with the police until one day he almost got into
   a real mess. He believes in the power of god more than anything else.
   The fact that he could build up his own business and start a family is
   a matter of god's mercy he told me.
   Little Chef Diner, Danville, Virgina
   Little Chef Diner, Danville, Virgina

   I had the best breakfast on my whole trip in this little place. This
   tiny diner place is a simple trailer from the 50's. It's a place where
   all kinds of people meet - old and young ones, black and white ones -
   everybody goes here. The girls thought it was really funny that I'm
   German but that I actually sound Australian. I just went to their
   Facebook site the other day and found out that this place closed a few
   days after I have been there. It really almost broke my heart but it
   also made me happy at the same time that I had the chance to go here
   before they shut down. Thank you so much for a great meal, a great
   conversation and some good laughs girls. I'll keep that amazing memory
   for the rest of my life.
   Unknown guy, North Carolina
   Unknown guy, North Carolina

   He had one of those really cool Ford 150 trucks. Most of the old guys
   use them for farm work these days and he was one of them. Folks like
   him won't retire until they're not able to work anymore.
   Dee, Sparta, Tennessee
   Dee, Sparta, Tennessee

   Dee's tire care in Sparta, Tennessee is a place that specialized on
   used car tires. I really don't have a clou why poeple need so many
   tires in the States but no matter where you go in the south you will
   always find heaps of tire shops. Dee has been in the tire business
   since forever in when it comes down to getting your ones fixed he is
   the big deal in Sparta. I never met someone being so passionate about
   something that he has done all his life. Thanks for a really inspiring
   experience, Dee!
   Danville Radiator Works, Danville, Virgina
   Danville Radiator Works, Danville, Virgina

   I was driving through Danville, Virgina trying to find a decent diner
   place. I stopped at DRW to check it out because it looked interesting
   to me. The boss of the business (middle) showed my a picture with his
   granddad and his father standing in the exact same place where we were
   having our chat. He introduced me to his crew and finally he send me
   next door to the “Little Chef Diner” – a tiny diner inside a trailer
   that truly carries the spirit if the 50’s. Thanks guys for sending me
   there – it was the most authentic food I had on the wohle entire trip.
   Garage, Wilkesboro, North Carolina
   Garage, Wilkesboro, North Carolina

   When I got to Wilkesboro the first time I came to visit the great
   "Merlefest". It's a festival that is all about Bluegrass music and that
   was initiated by Doc Watson. When I stopped at this place it wasn't
   quiet so easy to start a conversation until I told them that I have
   been here before to visit the festival. It seems to me that the whole
   south is somehow connected through music and old cars. Wait, beer and
   BBQ is a big part, too. "Alright then, take your picture if you are
   sure that it won't break your camera".
   Kenny, Tennessee
   Kenny, Tennessee

   Kenny had a real cool place located in a very old fomer, gas station.
   He is fixing all kinds of things that have an engine and take people
   from A to B. Lawn mowers, motor bikes, cars... whatever it is - as long
   as it runs on gas he's the man to fix it. Currently he's restoring a
   Ford Mustang that he had for along time. He wouldn't wanna show it to
   me until the project is finished. I guess I won't ever be able to see
   it but I'm sure it's going to be a real beauty.
   Jay, North Carolina
   Jay, North Carolina

   He was about to close his garage when I stopped. I really kind man and
   as most other man I met very focused on vintage cars. He showed me his
   muscle car that he kept in the back of the garage. More than 600 horse
   powers and an engine as loud as an AC/DC concert.
   Wilkesboro, North Carolina
   Wilkesboro, North Carolina

   I stopped exactly at this place last year to take a photo of the bill
   board of the shop "Frank's Tools". Last year it said: "God bless the
   working man - and woman". This year it said "There's no shame in saving
   money". These two guys just came out of the shop and we had a nice chat
   about bluegrass music and where to go for good concert in the evening.
   Michael, Danville, Virgina
   Michael, Danville, Virgina

   I was about to take a shot of a run down super supermarket in Danville,
   Virgina when this guy asked me “what are you doin’ here?”.
   Me: “I’m taking photos of this supermarket”.
   Him: “Why?”
   Me: “ ‘Cause I think it’s beautiful. I’m from Germany, we don’t have
   stuff like this at home.”
   Him: “So you’re traveling through the country taking shot of super
   markets?”.
   Me: “No, I’m taking shot of everything I like.”
   Him: “So why don’t cha take a picture of me, man?”
   Me: “Sure, if you’re ok with that I’m happy to take a shot of you.”
   Him: “Wait, let me get ready.”
   Me: “Alright, here we go – click, click, click. By the way, what’s
   you’re name? I’m Robert, nice to meet you.”
   Him: “I’m, uhm, I’m Micheal, just like Micheal Jackson. Whooohoooo.”
   Omar, Knoxville. Tennessee
   Omar, Knoxville. Tennessee

   He was sweeping the floor when I came along. He came 3 years ago from
   Syria and is now working in this place until he get's a better
   opportunity to make some money. A very nice guy and he was really
   interested in photography as well. If had to give away a job I would
   hire him straight away - that was the cleanest garage I have seen in
   the south.
   Llyle, Waynesboro, Virgina
   Llyle, Waynesboro, Virgina

   I met Llyle when I went to "Napa Auto Parts" to get myself one of these
   merchandising baseball caps. Lyle was sitting next to his 1984 Buick on
   a camping chair and it seemed that he had nothing alse to do other than
   admiring his own car. When I asked him if I could take a shot of  him
   he said: "no, just the car". When I returned that I think he and the
   car belong together 'cause they are a unit he agreed that he has to be
   in the picture. He nodded and started posing. But most important: he
   had to put a cloth on the hardtop first to make sure the paint won't
   get stained.
   Dean, A.P. Carter Highway, Virgina
   Dean, A.P. Carter Highway, Virgina

   I stopped because there was an old abandoned train trailer standing on
   the side of the road. I took some shots and noticed that guy watching
   me from the other side of the road in his rocking chair. I walked up to
   him and I asked him if he had ever been up on the Carter Family Fold -
   the place where the Carter Family had their little store, where they
   lived and where the whole Carter Family legend started. He told me that
   he had been there many times and that he had met June Carter Cash and
   Johnny Cash from time to time when they where in the neighborhood.
   Johnny Cash had a house up in the mountain and he came here quiet often
   to calm down and find some piece.
   Unkown guy, Nashville, Tennessee
   Unkown guy, Nashville, Tennessee

   I met this guy in a honky tonk bar in Nashville. I tried to have a
   little chat with him when I got myself a beer. I guess it’s kind of an
   understatement to call him not the biggest small talk talent. When I
   asked him if I can take a shot of him it seemed to me that he didn’t
   really give a shit. Anyway, cheers to the cool guy that I had a beer
   with in a honky tonk bar in Nashville – it was fun to meet you.
   Garage, North Carolina
   Garage, North Carolina

   I stopped here because I saw that wonderful 1957 Pointiac standing
   there. It's always easy to get in a conversation in the south when you
   start out with something about cars. The guy in the back was the boss.
   He had a good sense of humor and he was making fun of me in good way. I
   guess he thought I was a bit of a jerk, and you know what - maybe he's
   right. The other guy really only hung out and smoked cigarettes: "I
   can't stay at home with my wife all day so I rather hang out with my
   buddies and smoke some cigarettes."

   Tony, Sneedville, Tennessee
   Tony, Sneedville, Tennessee

   I drove past Tony Horton’s garage “Greasy Rock Auto” in Sneedville and
   I had the feeling I should stop. Tony Horton is a Dirt Race celebrity
   in the south. The guy in the picture is also named Tony and one of the
   mechanics at Greasy Rock Auto. He showed me “THE CAR” and all the
   trophies Tony won in the past years. I really liked the guys and I gave
   them my “Nappa Auto Parts” cap that I got in Waynesboro. We had a good
   chat and the youngest of the mechanics was blown away by the fact that
   there are roads in Germany where you’re allowed to go as fast as your
   car goes.
   Greasy Rock Auto, Sneedville, Tennessee
   Greasy Rock Auto, Sneedville, Tennessee

   This is Tony Horton, the famous dirt car race driver. When I first
   popped in he wasn't there so stayed a bit longer because I really
   wanted to meet him. His cars are always numbered with the 56. It seems
   that it is his lucky number due to the numbers of trophies that he had
   won. I even got a card with his signature!
   The crew at "Greasy Rock Auto" Sneedville, Tennesee
   The crew at "Greasy Rock Auto" Sneedville, Tennesee

   These guys are the main crew of Tony Horton's garage. Tony is a real
   big deal in the dirt car race scene and the guys are more than proud to
   work for him. In the background you can see his car with more than
   600hp and several trophies. More faith than fear!
   Franky, North Carolina
   Franky, North Carolina

   Franky wasn't much of a talker. If you would ask him a question he
   wouldn't go any further than a simple yes or no. He wasn't unfriendly
   or something, really not at all, he just doesn't enjoy a chat as much
   as other people do.
   Reed's Garage, Blue Ridge Mountains, Virgina
   Reed's Garage, Blue Ridge Mountains, Virgina

   I stopped because they had so many oldtimers in the yard and I just
   wanted to have a look. Then I saw this really nice bike - a vintage
   Kawasaki Z900 in mint condition. I walked in and the three guys were
   really busy working on the engine. When I asked if could take a picture
   two of them really didn't want to but the boss said - come on guys, he
   came all the way from Germany. I sent them the picture and got a really
   nice reply.
   Garage, North Carolina
   Garage, North Carolina

   This guy took over the place from his grand dad. I really liked the
   small red vehicle in the back. It was something that he built himself
   based on a kids scooter. It goes pretty fast and is loud as hell but it
   is loads of fun. His truck has something like a 8 liter diesel engine
   and it was his one and only - almost ... His mum is of course the most
   important thing and he made sure that she's in the picture!
   William's Antique Store, Roaring River, North Carolina
   William's Antique Store, Roaring River, North Carolina

   William asked me to send him some print of the photos that I took of
   him and his friends and so we had write down his address. This is him
   sitting in his office. The computer wasn't working but he didn't have
   an e-mail anyway. It took me a while but sent him the pictures and I
   hope he likes them. Another great beer that stands for southern
   hospitality and friendlyness – thanks William.
   William’s Antique Store, Roaring River, North Carolina
   William’s Antique Store, Roaring River, North Carolina

   Straight at the road William is running an antique store that’s located
   in an old warehouse. The inside is full of old things that for sure
   have great stories to tell. It seems that there’s not too much traffic
   in his day that’s why he’s hanging out on the porch a lot with his
   buddies. One thing I can tell you - it doesn’t get more American than
   the boots in this picture ... Cheers!

BODENSEE

   Born and raised in Lindau at Lake Constance I keep coming back home
   every once in a while. Lindau is a very touristy place during the
   summer season. The sea is full with little boats and the beaches are
   full of people. I for myself enjoy the quiet times when all the
   souvenir shops are closed, the hotels close their curtains and when the
   ice cream men from Italy enjoy their time off back home. Fall is the
   season I love the most. It gets foggy, the Swiss alps disappear and
   even the animals get calm. There is nothing more beautiful than the
   fresh and crisp autumn air with the smell of dry foliage.

HOCHSTÄNDE

   In my series “Hochstände” I went to the German forest to capture
   hunting blinds. The forest itself is something very quiet and peaceful
   but with the hunting blinds in the pictures you can almost hear the
   shot and barking dogs going after the deer. The addition of these
   hunting blinds turn these places into scary and brutal locations.

TUNNELS

   I started my series TUNNELS in back in 2005. I wanted to picture this
   everyday architecture that nobody ever pays attention to. All of these
   subway tunnels where built for nothing but functional reasons and no
   one ever wasted a single thought if they are visually appealing or not.
   I for myself find real beauty in them – the cold and pure concrete, the
   lights that turn out like ribs, cables to make all the electronics work
   and the rails that lead your look to the unknown behind the corner.

PHNOM PENH NIGHTS

   Back in the 70s Phnom Penh had a population of 2-3 million people.
   After the Khmer Rouge took over the city was almost abandoned and the
   population went down as low as 20000 people. This all happened within
   one week. After four years the Khmer Rouge were driven out of Phnom
   Penh by the Vietnamese in 1979, and people began to return to the city.
   The population today is about 1.5 million people.

   This series tries to picture an abandoned Phnom Penh. It’s the way that
   I imagine how it looked like in the 70s after most of the people were
   forced to leave their homes.

   Thanks to my friend  „Meng“ who took me around in his Tuktuk at night
   time and kept me safe!

AUSTRALIAN HOMES

   In 2012 and 2013 I had the chance to spend some time in Australia in a
   small town called Cessnock. I liked the architecture of the houses
   around and made it a series. It surprisingly turned out to be very 60s
   I think.

CAMBODIAN BARBERS

   Lately I had the chance to travel Cambodia and I spent ten days in the
   capital city Phnom Penh. Cambodia is a poor country with a very
   difficult past and its economy is struggling very hard. I saw people
   living in the streets on the most basic level that I have ever seen on
   all my travels. One thing that I noticed that there a barber shops
   everywhere in the city and no matter how little money these people
   living in the streets have  – you will hardly find anyone who doesn't
   have a decent haircut.

BACK ROADS

   When I drove through the southern states of the USA I decided to avoid
   the interstates and travel on the back roads instead. I found amazing
   places in a world that only existed in the past I thought. Obviously I
   was wrong. Check it out and follow me on my trip from Washington DC to
   Memphis, Tennessee.

ROLLER COASTERS

   I started taking shots of roller coasters at night at the Oktoberfest
   in Munich in 2005. Some years I couldn't get the sky right - it has to
   be a clear and black night with no clouds to get that deep black
   background. I like the silence in these pictures. When I actually took
   the shots people were screaming their lungs out ...

IDA OUGOURD

   This year I head the chance to travel to Northern Africa, Morocco. I
   stayed in a place called "Ida Ogourd" about 25 km away from the coast.
   "Ida" means something like village in English and "Ougourd" means
   Wednesday. That's because this is the day when the market is happening.
   Other than the market there is absolutely no business going on. My
   friend Omar took me to the house of his family and they made me some
   traditional Moroccan mint tea - one of the great experiences I made on
   this trip.

MOUNTAINS

   Whenever I have time I hop one of my motorbikes and go out of the city.
   Munich is surrounded by the Alps, Italy is just around the corner, and,
   Austria is not far either. This series shows a small selection of shots
   I took on these trips during the last two years. Watch out for more  -
   it's summertime and my bikes are all set to escape on weekends.
