Networked Nature

   Posted on October 17, 2015 | Leave a comment

   For the final lecture I leave you with this series of videos that you
   can watch at your leisure. These three films present concepts of
   technology, audio, editing, storytelling and remix. The second episode
   specifically takes up the concept of networked nature, but they are all
   worth a look and, to a certain extent, it doesn’t matter which order
   you watch them in. I recommend watching them in reverse order: 3 then 2
   and one.

   Adam Curtis’ remixes interviews, research, stock footage and music,
   to argue that computers have failed to liberate humanity and instead
   have “distorted and simplified our view of the world around us”.

   EPISODE 1

   In the first episode, Curtis tracks the effects of Ayn Rand’s ideas on
   American financial markets, particularly via the influence on Alan
   Greenspan.

   EPISODE 2

   The second episode investigates concepts of cybernetics and systems
   theory were applied to natural ecosystems, and how this relates to the
   false idea that there is a balance of nature.

   EPISODE 3

   The third and final episode discusses the selfish gene theory which
   holds that humans are machines controlled by genes which was invented
   by William Hamilton.
