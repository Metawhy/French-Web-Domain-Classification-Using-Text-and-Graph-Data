Welcome to PRABI !

   The PRABI is the Rhône-Alpes Bioinformatics Center, a IBiSA regional
   center member of the ReNaBi (French Network of Bioinformatic
   platforms). It gathers 12 research teams and/or platforms spread on six
   different sites. The PRABI has research, service and training
   activities in a large number of bioinformatics and biostatistics
   fields.

   This portal gives access to the different sites that are associated
   with the PRABI. Through it, you can reach the different on-line
   services proposed, as well as downloadable software.

   The PRABI gathers many research teams that are involved in the
   development of new bioinformatics tools using mathematics, statistics
   and computer science and their staff list can be accessed from their
   respective home pages. The PRABI-AMSB also has permanent and temporary
   staff members who can provide expertise in various domains of
   bioinformatics (e.g., phylogeny, expression data, comparative genomics,
   annotation) or help in the tranfer of bioinformatics tools from a
   development stage to a production stage (e.g., implementation as
   webtools).

    Computing ressources
    PRABI-Doua & PRABI-AMSB
       The computing ressources of these two sites are shared.
       Cluster summary
       The cluster is located in a devoted room on the University Lyon 1
       campus. Its computing power can be summarized by the following
       characteristics :

     * 18 “fat” computing nodes (including 1 with 1 Tb RAM).
     * 92 CPUs.
     * 672 cores.
     * 3.9 Tb RAM.
     * 215 Tb of high performance storage capacity.

Cluster in details

Training room

   Those two sites site have also a training room with 16 laptops (PC
   under Linux/Debian) and a video conference room.

PRABI-IBCP

   This site also has a training room
