Corporate Social Responsibility

   NETGEAR is committed to ensuring the highest standards of social
   responsibility regardless of where our products are made. Under
   NETGEAR’s corporate social responsibility program there are five main
   pillars.

   Ethics

   Labor with Dignity

   Regulatory and Environmental Compliance

   Health and Safety

   Management Systems

   Being an applicant member of the Electronic Industry Citizenship
   Coalition (EICC), NETGEAR fully supports the vision and goals of the
   EICC. We endorse the EICC Code of Conduct, and incorporates EICC
   standards into the NETGEAR Corporate Supplier Code of Conduct. Our
   corporate social responsibility program includes various initiatives
   and monitoring activities which reinforce our commitment as a
   responsible global citizen. NETGEAR Internal Audit and Environmental
   Compliance conduct an annual risk assessment and perform audits on
   significant third party manufacturing locations at least once a year,
   which we target to cover no less than 80% of our total production.
   Results from audits are shared and agreed with suppliers, and supplier
   corrective action requests, if needed, are subsequently followed up
   during the Quarterly Business Review led by the Operations Department.

       personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us
       using the contact details provided under the "Contact Us" heading
       below [link].

       below [link].

     * You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send

   Information to recipients in countries other than your country,
   including the United States, where we are headquartered. These
   countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in
   which you initially provided the information. When we transfer your
   Personal Information to other countries, we will protect that
   information as described in this Privacy Notice or as disclosed to you
   at the time of data collection.  By using our Sites, Products, and
   Services or providing any Personal Information, where applicable law
   permits, you agree to the transfers, processing, and storage of your
   Personal Information outside of your country of residence.

   If you are located in the European Economic Area, ("EEA"), we comply
   with applicable legal requirements providing adequate safeguards for
   the transfer of Personal Information to countries other than the
   country where you are located. In particular, we use contractual
   protections for the transfer of Personal Information to third parties,
   such as the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses.
