   Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central
   authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins
   is carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source; its
   design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take
   part. Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting
   uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.

   to use some portions of our site.

   We use cookies for the following purposes:
