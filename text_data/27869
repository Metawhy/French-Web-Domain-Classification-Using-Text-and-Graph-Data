SERVICE ANNUAL SURVEY

PURPOSE

   To provide estimates of revenue and other measures for most traditional
   service industries. The United States Code, Title 13, authorizes this
   survey and provides for mandatory responses.

COVERAGE

   The survey collects data from companies whose primary business or
   operation is to provide services to individuals, businesses, and
   governments (NAICS 51, 5231, 52392, 52393, 532, 54, 56,62, 71, 81).
   This survey also covers the Transportation and Warehousing sector
   (NAICS 484, 492, and 493). Industry coverage and detail have been
   expanded since 1982, and include most personal, business, automotive,
   amusement and recreation, social welfare, health care, and other
   professional services. The use of expanded 1987 SIC classifications
   began in 1991, and the industries covered accounted for about 20% of
   the Nation's 1994 Gross Domestic Product.

   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) was used for
   the first time with the 1999 survey to collect data for the Service
   Annual Survey (SAS). The scope of the Service Annual Survey has been
   broadened to encompass the old Annual Survey of Communication Services
   and the old Transportation Annual Survey. With the implementation of
   NAICS, approximately 150 additional service industries are being
   covered. The North American Product Classification System (NAPCS) was
   introduced for the first time with the 2001 survey year to include the
   Information Sector (NAICS 51), and Computer System Design and Related
   Services (Industry Group 5415).

CONTENT

   Collected data include operating revenue for both taxable and
   tax-exempt firms and organizations; sources of revenue and expenses by
   type for selected industries; operating expenses for tax-exempt firms;
   and selected industry-specific items. In addition, starting with the
   1999 survey, e-commerce data were collected for all industries, and
   export and inventory data were collected for selected industries.

FREQUENCY

   Data collection begins in January following the survey year and
   continues for about 28 weeks. Reported data are for activities which
   take place during the calendar year. Prior to 1982, the survey was
   conducted monthly and since that time it has been conducted annually. A
   new sample is introduced roughly every 5 years.

METHODS

   This is a mail-out/mail-back survey of approximately 60,000 selected
   service businesses with paid employees; supplemented by administrative
   records data or imputed values to account for non-employer and certain
   other businesses. To be eligible for the list sample, service
   businesses must be in the Business Register List (BR), which contains
   all Employer Identification Numbers (EINs) for listed businesses and
   all locations of multi-establishment companies. EINs may represent one
   or more establishments and firms may have one or more EINs.

   In the initial sampling, companies are stratified by major and minor
   kind of business, and by estimated receipts or revenue. All companies
   with total receipts above applicable size cutoffs are included in the
   survey and report for all their service industry locations. In a second
   stage, EINs of unselected companies are stratified by major kind of
   business and receipts or revenue. Within each stratum a simple random
   sample of EINs is selected.

   The initial sample is updated quarterly to reflect births and deaths,
   adding new employer businesses identified in the business and
   professional classification survey, and dropping firms and EINs that
   are no longer active. During interim periods, service non-employer and
   other businesses are represented by administrative records data or
   imputed values.

PRODUCTS

   Service Annual Survey reports are normally published no later than 13
   months after the end of the survey year. Summary data (total revenue
   and total expenses) are provided at the sector, sub-sector and industry
   group level for the survey year and past years. Detailed expense data
   are published for select sectors and subsectors. Industry specific
   data, such as product line and detailed revenue (source of funding),
   are provided for selected industries. In addition, there are data for
   selected kinds of business by federal income-tax status (taxable and
   tax-exempt).

USES

   The Bureau of Economic Analysis uses these data in its preparation of
   national income and product accounts, and its benchmark and annual
   input-output tables. The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses the data as
   input to its producer price indexes and in developing productivity
   measurements. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) uses
   the data to estimate expenditures for the National Health Accounts. The
   Coalition of Service Industries uses data for general research and
   planning.

   Trade and professional organizations use the estimates to analyze
   industry trends and benchmark their own statistical programs, develop
   forecasts, and evaluate regulatory requirements. The media use
   estimates for news reports and background information. Private
   businesses use the estimates to measure market share; analyze business
   potential; and plan investment decisions.

SPECIAL FEATURES

   The Service Annual Survey provides the only source of annual receipts
   estimates for the service industries.

SERVICE ANNUAL SURVEY

PURPOSE

   To provide estimates of revenue and other measures for most traditional
   service industries. The United States Code, Title 13, authorizes this
   survey and provides for mandatory responses.

COVERAGE

   The survey collects data from companies whose primary business or
   operation is to provide services to individuals, businesses, and
   governments (NAICS 51, 5231, 52392, 52393, 532, 54, 56,62, 71, 81).
   This survey also covers the Transportation and Warehousing sector
   (NAICS 484, 492, and 493). Industry coverage and detail have been
   expanded since 1982, and include most personal, business, automotive,
   amusement and recreation, social welfare, health care, and other
   professional services. The use of expanded 1987 SIC classifications
   began in 1991, and the industries covered accounted for about 20% of
   the Nation's 1994 Gross Domestic Product.

   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) was used for
   the first time with the 1999 survey to collect data for the Service
   Annual Survey (SAS). The scope of the Service Annual Survey has been
   broadened to encompass the old Annual Survey of Communication Services
   and the old Transportation Annual Survey. With the implementation of
   NAICS, approximately 150 additional service industries are being
   covered. The North American Product Classification System (NAPCS) was
   introduced for the first time with the 2001 survey year to include the
   Information Sector (NAICS 51), and Computer System Design and Related
   Services (Industry Group 5415).

CONTENT

   Collected data include operating revenue for both taxable and
   tax-exempt firms and organizations; sources of revenue and expenses by
   type for selected industries; operating expenses for tax-exempt firms;
   and selected industry-specific items. In addition, starting with the
   1999 survey, e-commerce data were collected for all industries, and
   export and inventory data were collected for selected industries.

FREQUENCY

   Data collection begins in January following the survey year and
   continues for about 28 weeks. Reported data are for activities which
   take place during the calendar year. Prior to 1982, the survey was
   conducted monthly and since that time it has been conducted annually. A
   new sample is introduced roughly every 5 years.

METHODS

   This is a mail-out/mail-back survey of approximately 60,000 selected
   service businesses with paid employees; supplemented by administrative
   records data or imputed values to account for non-employer and certain
   other businesses. To be eligible for the list sample, service
   businesses must be in the Business Register List (BR), which contains
   all Employer Identification Numbers (EINs) for listed businesses and
   all locations of multi-establishment companies. EINs may represent one
   or more establishments and firms may have one or more EINs.

   In the initial sampling, companies are stratified by major and minor
   kind of business, and by estimated receipts or revenue. All companies
   with total receipts above applicable size cutoffs are included in the
   survey and report for all their service industry locations. In a second
   stage, EINs of unselected companies are stratified by major kind of
   business and receipts or revenue. Within each stratum a simple random
   sample of EINs is selected.

   The initial sample is updated quarterly to reflect births and deaths,
   adding new employer businesses identified in the business and
   professional classification survey, and dropping firms and EINs that
   are no longer active. During interim periods, service non-employer and
   other businesses are represented by administrative records data or
   imputed values.

PRODUCTS

   Service Annual Survey reports are normally published no later than 13
   months after the end of the survey year. Summary data (total revenue
   and total expenses) are provided at the sector, sub-sector and industry
   group level for the survey year and past years. Detailed expense data
   are published for select sectors and subsectors. Industry specific
   data, such as product line and detailed revenue (source of funding),
   are provided for selected industries. In addition, there are data for
   selected kinds of business by federal income-tax status (taxable and
   tax-exempt).

USES

   The Bureau of Economic Analysis uses these data in its preparation of
   national income and product accounts, and its benchmark and annual
   input-output tables. The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses the data as
   input to its producer price indexes and in developing productivity
   measurements. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) uses
   the data to estimate expenditures for the National Health Accounts. The
   Coalition of Service Industries uses data for general research and
   planning.

   Trade and professional organizations use the estimates to analyze
   industry trends and benchmark their own statistical programs, develop
   forecasts, and evaluate regulatory requirements. The media use
   estimates for news reports and background information. Private
   businesses use the estimates to measure market share; analyze business
   potential; and plan investment decisions.

SPECIAL FEATURES

   The Service Annual Survey provides the only source of annual receipts
   estimates for the service industries.
