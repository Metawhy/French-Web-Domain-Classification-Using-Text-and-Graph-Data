NEPAL: Torture: Ramesh SHARMA

   Forwarded Urgent Appeal |Nepal | June 12, 2003
   Tweet

   Dear Friends

   Below is an urgent appeal we are forwarding from INSEC on behalf of Mr
   Ramesh SHARMA and others being subjected to extreme torture in Nepal,
   and we would welcome your action on their behalf. Please
   write/fax/email the Nepalese authorities, using the information
   supplied below, and urge them to take action now. Thank you.

   SITUATION:

   Ramesh SHARMA

   Mr Sharma has been under treatment at the Tribhuwan University Teaching
   Hospital (bed no: 408, Ophthalmology Ward). He has lost his right eye
   after being subjected to an indiscriminate baton charge by the Police
   during a peaceful torch rally on 11 May 2003 in Ratnapark, Kathmandu.
   Mr Sharma sustained severe injuries to both his eyes because the Police
   allegedly hit him several times with iron-spiked sticks and
   specifically targeted his eyes.

   According to Mr Sharma, he tried to defend himself, especially his
   eyes, with his bare hands. However, this failed because the Police
   repeatedly charged at him, and he is sure that the action of the Police
   was deliberate. Mr Sharma said that although he had lost an eye, he
   hoped it would serve to ‘open eyes of the people to restore democracy
   and people’s rights’.

   Prithwi Kumar PRAJAPATI

   Prithwi Kumar PRAJAPATI (50 years old) is a resident of Bhakatapur
   Municipality-14. He was severely beaten by the Police on 14 May after
   he fell unconscious having been overcome by tear gas lobbed by the
   Police to disperse a rally. The rally was taking place as a prelude to
   the special meeting of the members of dissolved parliament against the
   royal regression, slated for 28 and 29 May.

   Mr Prajapati is an activist with the All-Nepal Revolutionary Peasants
   Association (a sister organisation of the Nepal Workers and Peasants
   Party). He was beaten with the butt of a gun after he fell down
   unconscious on the street when he was heading to Singh Durbar, the
   administrative headquarters of the nation.

   Mr Prajapati’s intestine was cut in two places, penetrating through the
   anal canal. His belly became filled with blood. For two hours he lay
   suffering from internal bleeding, lying in a pool of his own blood.
   No-one was there to help him, as the rest of the demonstrators had
   already been shunted off. In the end, some passers-by took him to Bir
   Hospital. However, the staff at this government hospital ignored the
   intensity of Mr Prajapati’s injuries and supplied only saline water. Mr
   Prajapati’s relatives complained. He is now under treatment at cabin
   no.6, Kathmandu Model Hospital.

   TORTURE

   Police in Siraha have arrested 8 people they considered part of the
   Dalit-Ram community, on the charge of looting the house of Bishnu
   SHRESTHA, Bastipur Village Development Committee – 9, Gudigaun, in the
   same district, on 27 May. The 8 accused were at Mr Shrestha’s house to
   play in a band on the occasion of his son’s marriage.

   According to the Nepal Settlement Protection Society (NSPS), a local
   human rights organisation in Siraha:

   Ashok Ram,

   Phaguniya Ram,

   Chamak Ram,

   Hari Har Ram,

   Arjun Ram, and

   Ram Lakhan Ram

   all of the Bastipur Village Development Committee-8, Rupi Ram of
   Bachharwa, VDC, and

   Pabitar Ram,of Kalyanpur Kalabanjar, VDC, were arrested by the Police.

   According to Dev Raj Pokhrel, the INSEC district representative in
   Siraha, those arrested were not the looters. The 8 had gone to Mr
   Shreshta’s house to play in the wedding band on 26 May. Unknown looters
   had looted the house, and the administration has failed to bring them
   to book.

   The Police have kept the victims in custody and inflicted severe mental
   and physical torture on them. The Police have not allowed them to
   contact their lawyers or meet their relatives. The Torture has
   increased as the local papers have disseminated news about the Police
   atrocities.

   Due to the immense torture, Chamak Ram, Ram Lakhan Ram, and Ashok Ram,
   fell sick and were taken to a local hospital in Lahan on 29 May. The
   Police continued torturing them even after they were brought back to
   custody on 30 May.

   The Dalit community of the district has condemned these acts of Torture
   on the part of the State against the Dalit community. The Dalit
   community has also demanded the release of the victims and has sought
   co-operation from the National Human Rights Commission and other human
   rights organisations, including INSEC, for due compensation against the
   torture.

   SUGGESTED LETTER:

   Dear

   I would like to bring to your notice the following violations of the

   of the gravest crimes.

   Details of Cases:

   1 Ramesh SHARMA

   Hospital (bed no: 408, Ophthalmology Ward). He has lost his right eye
   after being subjected to an indiscriminate baton charge by the Police
   during a peaceful torch rally on 11 May 2003 in Ratnapark, Kathmandu.
   Mr Sharma sustained severe injuries to both his eyes because the Police
   allegedly hit him several times with iron-spiked sticks and
   specifically targeted his eyes.

   2 Prithwi Kumar PRAJAPATI

   Mr Prithwi Kumar Prajapati (50 years old) is a resident of Bhakatapur
   Municipality-14. He was severely beaten by the Police on 14 May after
   he fell unconscious having been overcome by tear gas lobbed by the
   Police to disperse a rally. He was beaten with the butt of a gun after
   he fell down unconscious in the street when he was heading to Singh

   Lakhan RAM of the Bastipur Village Development Committee-8, and Rupi
   RAM of Bachharwa VDC, and Pabitar RAM, of Kalyanpur Kalabanjar, VDC,
   were arrested by the Police on 27 May, on suspicion of looting. The
   Police considered these 8 people as part of the Dalit-Ram community.
   The 8 men were at the house of Mr Bishnu SHRESTHA, which was the house
   looted, to play in a band at the wedding of his son.

   The Police have kept the 8 victims in custody and inflicted severe
   mental and physical torture on them, and they have not been allowed to
