Wide Variety available

   By the word wide variety, we do not specifically mean to say that
   inline skates are available in different designs. By a wide range, we
   suggest that inline skates have a variety in type, in size, in liners,
   in cuffs, closure systems and much more. Inline skates are also
   available for different skill level types. There can be skates for men,
   women, young boys and girls. The point is that this wide variety
   ultimately helps the users to purchase according to their suitability.

Part Details

   Inline skates are made up of 6-8 different parts. All these parts, if
   of high quality, make the riding experience an amazing one for users.
   First comes the boot. Usually, long boots are used to design the best
   inline skates. Speed skaters often use a carbon fiber boot, whereas
   those who want it for recreational purpose use a soft kick for greater
   comfort. Second and one of the essential things in the lineup or the
   frame. Carbon fiber frames are expensive but generally more flexible in
   recreational skating shoes. These are cheap but not much elastic. Wheel
   size is another part which is vital in this matter. In the range
   between 44mm to 125mm, there are 7-8 different wheel sizes for
   different skill level riders.

History of Inline skates

   The concept of skating born around the late 1800s. During the 1895 to
   1899 period, a UK-based company made road skates. These skates had four
   parallel wheels just like a car – two in the front and two in the back.
   Developments took place, but the concept of inline skates typically
   wasn’t there. In 1950, Inline skates appeared in the magazine “Popular
   Mechanics.” Later on, in the year 1954, they were again published in
   the issue of “Popular Science.”

The journey begins

   There was a long gap after that; however, in 1972, inline skates were
   openly used in a commercial by the famous beverage company Mountain
   Dew. Mountain Dew used Mettoy’s product known by the name of Skeeler.
   They attempted to sell his product which was an inline skate developed
   for hockey players and speed skaters. In the year 1987, a company by
   the name of Rollerblade became the first one to sell the inline skates
   for both men, and women commercially. Since then, many companies came
   into the field, and the trend of inline skates began to increase
   rapidly.

Records Broken from Inline Skates

   No one could believe the fact that inline skates would get so much
   popularity in such a short time. In the year 1996, Jason Lewis became
   the first male to complete the crossing of the USA only on inline
   skates. A part of his tour named Expedition 360, in which the main aim
   was to travel the globe using human power alone. On his journey, a
   horrific incident took place, and he was mishit by a car in Colorado.
   Unfortunately, he broke both his legs and had to rest for a further
   nine months, after which he completed his journey from Fort Lauderdale
   to San Francisco. Skates for women have also been popular over the past
   many years. We can see the example of Kacie Fischer who has been
   holding the latest record for traveling across the USA on inline skates
   in a period of 47 days.

Variety of Inline Skates

   There are a variety of inline skates to choose from, and the in the
   market you have different types and sizes. There are cheap models and
   expensive skates, colorful and single colored skates, simple and
   complex. There are also different skates for men, women, and children.
   For each of these groups, the skates come in various sizes, colors,
   distinctive features, and complexity.

​

Inline skates for men

   For different genders, there are different kinds of skates. For men,
   the variety ranges from speed skates to fitness skates and aggressive
   skates. All these are different, and each serves a different purpose.
   The inline speed skates can race faster than a speeding bullet. Some of
   them have hydrogen wheels with carbon fiber wrapped shell boots and
   power boosting speed frames. The aggressive type of skates may come
   with larger wheels for long, smooth glides. Because the ankle cuff is
   lower than the usual position, it gives greater flexibility and
   enhanced control. It also helps your heel stay fixed in place so that
   you don’t lose your balance. Rollerblades for men are the most
   user-friendly and lightweight among all fast skates. They are easy to
   use, and the wheels roll effortlessly.

Inline skates for women

   For casual women skaters, there are considerably affordable skates
   which are solely for recreational purposes. The wheel size of these
   skates stays within 84mm so that they can maintain control and a good
   hold. The main aim or objective of these is to ensure comfort,
   confidence, and stability. The features of these are minimal so that
   the rider can have the most fun while skating without any complication.
   The other type of skates for women is rollerblade cross-training inline
   skates. The wheel size in these varies from 84mm to 125mm. Women who
   plan to skate for a longer duration with added features should go for
   these skates. They also ensure balance and control, regardless of the
   additional performance features. Another type is Freestyle inline
   skates which are very versatile and addresses crowds interested in
   fastness and maneuvers.

Inline skates for kids

   When it comes to kids or young beginners, there are two main types of
   skates. One is Quad Skates, originally called roller skates which has
   four wheels, two in front and two at the back. Helps the child in
   keeping balance while skating. These are similar to simple tennis
   shoes, except that they have wheels on them. They allow kids to stand
   in their normal positions without falling backward or forward. Quad
   skates are generally considered the best skates for kids, beginners in
   particular because they are very conventional. The other type is the
   Rollerblades which has 4-5 wheels in a straight line. These don’t offer
   much balance to the riders as the quad skates do. However, for vigorous
   training and exercise, these inline skates work well. For children
   usually, the designers aim to provide the utmost comfort and safety
   straps.

 Ready for buying Your First Pair of Inline Skates? Consider These Points!

   Contrary to popular opinion, inline skates vary when it comes to their
   parts and features. If you are new to the inline skating world or
   moving on to the next level, you need to understand what these parts
   are and see if your prospect inline skates have them.

Wheels

   Wheels play a big part in inline skates because their movability,
   quality, and size will need to match your level, type of inline skating
   style, and the surface you prefer. Hard wheels are suitable for indoor
   skating, while softer wheels are good for outdoor skating.

Bearings

   Make sure your wheel bearings will allow you to turn and make sudden
   angle changes. Check the ABEC numbers. If its high, it will help you
   become better and faster.

Brakes

   The most important part of the best skates are the brakes. Check what
   brake system the skates have. If you are new to inline skating, check
   if the brake system allows you to adjust the brake pads’ height to
   match your needs.

Frame

   Metal frames are considerably more expensive but better for fast
   speeds.

Closures

   It’s crucial the skates don’t get derailed when you skate. Check if the
   closures are either lace or buckle. Make sure you are comfortable with
   them.

Why choosing the right in-line skate matters?

   Imagine gliding around your favorite park in your brand new skates and
   suddenly falling flat on your face. Or perhaps, a skating competition
   with the skaters on your block and you being the last person to reach
   the finish line because your skates couldn’t keep up with your pace.
   Either you are too clumsy, or you chose the wrong skates for yourself.
   It is probably the latter case. It shows the importance of selecting
   the right kind of skates to prevent all sorts of accidents.

   It is essential to first research and asks about what skates are best
   for you, and then buy them. Choosing the wrong size or the incorrect
   type of skates can result in a lot of unwanted situations. It can
   certainly reduce your performance. All the dreams you had of riding
   around in your new skates and showing off in front of your friends will
   shatter. You could also possibly develop weird foot and ankle problems
   such as calluses, rashes, severe itching or tendonitis. You certainly
   wouldn’t want ugly things sprouting from your feet. Wrong skates can
   also result in extreme unease and long-term medical issues. There are
   different skates for varying age groups, genders, and levels. If you
   end up with the wrong pair, it could make you go through a lot of
   embarrassment along with intense discomfort.

   Buying the best and the correct pair of inline skates should be your
   top priority. Only then you can master the art of skating effortlessly
   like a pro. And also winning all those skating competitions, leaving
   everyone in awe.

How to choose the best inline skates?

   Now that you are aware of the factors that make good inline skates, you
   now have to know how to pick the perfect pair for you. Here are some of
   the questions you need to consider as you choose your new pair of
   inline skates:
     * What level are you? Inline skaters co-exist into four different
       groups: novice, beginner, intermediate, and advance
     * What skates are for you? For a novice or first-timers, it is ideal
       to get 72-80 mm wheeled inline skates which are suitable for
       recreational use. Beginners or returning skaters can get 80-88mm
       wheeled inline skates, perfect for both urban and recreational
       skating. Intermediate skaters are suited for 80-100mm wheeled
       skates for performance, civic, and recreational skating. Advanced
       skaters are fit for inline skates with 80-100mm wheels that are
       suitable for speed, recreation, production, and urban use.
     * What brand offers what you need? For a varied selection fit for any
       level, K2, Roces, and Rollerblade have several options to choose.
       Novice users can try out Bladerunner. Brands like Vanilla, Luigino,
       Bont, and Powerslide are suitable for advanced skaters seeking the
       best performance and fast speeds while remaining comfortable.
     * What’s the price? If you found the model and your level, check out
       the prices and see what’s ok for you.
     * What size are you? Not all brands use the same foot-size chart, so
       double check before you buy.

QUICK TIPS TO BUY INLINE SKATES LIKE A PRO

   It certainly won’t be surprising to know that if every time you go to
   buy a good pair of inline skates, you return empty-handed because you
   couldn’t make a decision. Or that the variety of so many colors and
   types left you completely puzzled and you felt like buying them all,
   there are some reasonably easy tips and tricks that you could adopt and
   save yourself from a lot of trouble.
     * Understand the different kinds of skates. Each type has its various
       features, and it is essential to be aware of all sorts.
     * Always know what level of skating you stand at and research about
       what skates can be the best fit for you. A beginner wouldn’t want
       to end up wearing advanced level skates that they probably can’t
       handle.
     * Make the wheel size, texture and hardness your utmost priority. You
       don’t want to ride on substantial squishy wheels which make you
       feel like you are standing on jelly, or on unbeatable hard wheels
       that feel like the rock to the skin.
     * Do a test ride. Wear your choice of skates and ride around in them,
       so you know how well they run and whether they are entirely
       comfortable for you. Try them on in different positions and various
       areas to check their flexibility and versatility.
     * Always you should know what kind of skates you want and what result
       you want to achieve. You cannot wear speed or aggressive skates
       when all you are interested in is recreational skates.
     * Know what brand you want. It can make things a lot easier for you
       if you know the particular brand of skates you wish to purchase.
     * Quote your budget and price range. Once you know how much strain
       your wallet or pocket can survive, you can then choose from the
       ones that do fall under your budget.
     * Make sure to check the skates for quality and defects. No one wants
       to take home a flawed pair and then sulk throughout the day because
       they are not fit to ride.
     * Never forget the protective gear that comes with the skates. It is
       an absolute necessity without which you might hurt your face or any
       other part of the body.

   Be it inline skates or any other product, following some guidelines and
   tips can always come in handy. Not only will you return home with ‘the’
   pair of skates, but you will also be a happy person because you made
   the correct decision after so many efforts on your part. Hence, follow
   these simple steps and voila! Glide away like an absolute pro.

   wearing them, you would feel the need just to put them on because
   that’s what they do to a skater. It is as if your skates become your
   companion and a helping hand every time you enter the sports ground to
   play. They enable you to feel light on your feet and skid across
   different platforms without any obstacle getting in your way.

   Also, the perfect inline skates will be there for you whenever you need
   them. If you are feeling anxious and need fresh air, take your skates
   out for a ride, and you will come back anxiety-free and cheerful. Or if
   you think you are not as active as you should be when playing your
   favorite sports, take a run on the skates and wait for the magic to
   happen. Treat your skates nicely, and they’ll become your best
   companion for life.

CONCLUSION

   It is not a matter of how good of a skater you are or how nothing gets
   in your way when skating – it is more about how much you invest in
   things that would help you become perfect at it. And when it comes to
   skating, it is going to matter how much you put into buying the best
   inline skates. A good pair of skates will come a long way and make you
   able to become the best at the game.

   An hour’s worth of intense skating will burn up to 360 calories, and
   you won’t even feel it. Not only that but it will also enhance your
   mental state while you struggle to focus on your speed and not to lose
   your balance. You start reflecting on your life and start thinking
   about various things, making different plans which you don’t get to do
   at any other time.

   It is safe to conclude that skating is, in fact, one of the best
   activities you will ever come across. It is a multipurpose sport which
   targets your entire body and doesn’t just focus on helping you skate.
   It is more like the holy grail that enables you to achieve so many
   things at the same. All you need is the perfect pair of inline skates
   that help you acquire what you aim for through the art of skating. So,
