About The Social Network

   David Fincher's The Social Network is the stunning tale of a new breed
   of cultural insurgent: a punk genius who sparked a revolution and
   changed the face of human interaction for a generation, and perhaps
   forever. Shot through with emotional brutality and unexpected humor,
   this superbly crafted film chronicles the formation of Facebook and the
   battles over ownership that followed upon the website's unfathomable
   success. With a complex, incisive screenplay by Aaron Sorkin and a
   brilliant cast including Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin
   Timberlake, The Social Network bears witness to the birth of an idea
   that rewove the fabric of society even as it unraveled the friendship
   of its creators.
