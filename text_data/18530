How to Nail the Bot to Human Handoff

   2016 was supposed to be the year of the chatbot. But while the number
   of companies building chatbots has exploded, chatbots themselves
   haven’t really lived up to the hype. As venture capitalist, Fred Wilson
   wrote, “I would be hard pressed to name a super popular chatbot on
   Messenger, Kik, Slack, and Telegram.”

   The problem is that a lot of chatbots just aren’t advanced enough to
   replace your existing support or sales functions. They’re good at one
   thing—checking the weather, or booking a flight. And even then, they
   often don’t actually make life easier.

   simple Google Search. Image source: Intercom)

   Take Poncho, a chatbot that tells you the weather. It takes around 60
   taps to talk to Poncho and figure out if it will rain tomorrow. It
   takes 16 taps to accomplish the same thing in a simple Google search.

   While Poncho is fun and cool, it doesn’t actually make it easier to
   find the weather than your native weather app. It’s a problem many
   chatbots suffer from—they’re fun and interesting, but don’t bring much
   to the table.

What’s Possible with Messaging Today

   At Sonar, we know that messaging helps businesses build more intimate
   relationships with customers. But today, one of the biggest mistakes
   people make is thinking they can use bots to outsource 100% of customer
   communication. The bots simply aren’t up to the task—yet.

   The hype around chatbots is only a small part of a much bigger trend:
   the fragmentation of communication across customer channels. A 2016
   study shows that 65% of mobile users have used a messaging app to talk
   to a business. An even higher 76% have done so over SMS.

   To really connect to your customers through messaging, you can’t just
   jump on the chatbot trend. You have to consider how messaging fits into
   your larger business strategy.

   These are the three primary ways that businesses today use bots and
   humans to talk to their customers:
    1. Handoff the customer conversation from a bot to humans
    2. Switch requests between bot and human, based on the type of request
    3. Use human agents to ensure the bot runs reliably

   Let’s take a look how companies today are implementing the bot-to-human
   handoff, and tips for how you can do the same.

Route Questions Between Bots and Humans

   According to a report from Twilio, consumers prefer messaging to every
   other channel of customer support. Messaging is a low-stakes way to
   talk directly to a business, without getting stuck in a system of
   support tickets and automated responses.

   Automated chatbots can tell consumers the time a business is open, or
   what a return policy is, but when it comes to offering real support,
   you need to have a human on the other line.

   Let’s take a look at how the Radisson Blu Edwardian Hotel uses
   messaging to provide support to guests:

   Messaging with Edwardian

   (The Edwardian Hotel’s Edward. Image source: Aspect)
    1. Guests send a question or request to Edward
    2. Edward answers common questions, like where the gym is, entirely on
       his own
    3. Edward routes customer requests, like room service, to hotel staff

   Edward uses a rule-based system and Natural Language Understanding
   (NLU) to interpret what guests say to it, and respond appropriately.
   Within a closed system like hotel service, there simply isn’t enough
   data to use machine learning effectively. Tobials Goebel, part of the
   team behind Edward points out that “building a completely unsupervised
   learning bot can backfire quickly.”

   Instead, the team mapped out the different types of requests Edward
   would receive, and built it to respond accordingly:

   Edwardian Bot Logic

   (Template for self-service applications. Source: Aspect)

   For service-heavy industries like hospitality, messaging provides a
   huge opportunity for companies to provide instant support, while
   scaling down costs. Through Edward, guests are able to find information
   they need without having to search the hotel website or call down the
   front desk. It helps the Edwardian cut support costs, while providing
   better and faster service.

Use Humans to Robot-Proof Your Service

   Automating tedious chores like booking flights or scheduling meetings
   are particularly good use-cases for bots—the only problem is that the
   bots aren’t smart enough yet. AI assistants like X.ai and Clara still
   rely on support agents to humanize bots and patch over their mistakes.

   In an interview with Bloomberg, Clara CEO pointed out that she would
   rather build a more expensive, reliable service than a completely
   automated one that gave customers a bad experience.

   Let’s take a look at how SnapTravel, a service that helps travelers
   book hotels accomplishes this.

   SnapTravel Chatbot Messages
    1. SnapTravel’s bot asks for the customer’s travel dates, hotel
       preferences, and budget.
    2. The bot returns with a list of 3 hotels that match the pre-selected
       criteria.
    3. When the bot can’t process the conversation, a support agent is
       ready on the wings to step in.
    4. Each travel booking is approved by a human agent.

   SnapTravel describes itself as a “half-bot half-human service.” Because
   booking a hotel is a pretty cut and dry process, SnapTravel can rely on
   bots to power a big chunk of the conversation with customers. But faced
   with more ambiguous questions, the service falls back onto human
   support representatives.

   SnapTravel Human Step-In

   April steps in to the rescue!

   It’s a smart business model. By providing it’s service across SMS,
   Facebook Messenger, and Slack, SnapTravel creates a low-friction point
   of entry for customers who don’t need a dedicated traveling app.
   Creating a bot allows the company to scale efficiently, while human
   agents ensure that the service works reliably.

Bots Are the Gateway to Messaging

   Bots Landscape

   (VentureBeat’s Bots Landscape infographic shows 170+ companies
   developing bots with $4 billion in total funding. image source:
   VentureBeat)

   There are now over 30,000 chatbots on Facebook Messenger alone. The bot
   landscape is filling up with bots that tell you the weather, schedule
   meetings, and manage your email. Chatbots offer an exciting vision of
   the future where AI and natural language processing allow businesses to
   automate personalized interaction with customers.

   The truth is, we’re not quite there yet.

   At Sonar, we believe that chat is the interface of the future—we built
   our business around it. But what we’ve seen day in and day out is that
   in order for businesses to really succeed on chat, they need a hybrid.
   They need to nail down the bot to human handoff.

SMS 101: How to apply messaging along the customer lifecycle

   twosms

   Whether it’s a message from your Lyft telling you your car is here, or
   a support notification from Seamless, we’re used to seeing
   transactional SMS messages. The true potential of SMS, however, isn’t
   siloing it into your marketing department or support team. It’s
   extending it across the entire customer lifecycle.

The 3 Phases of Lifecycle SMS

   “Messaging allows us to…go with customers wherever they are and to
   interact with services in an asynchronous way.”
   –Chris Messina, Developer Experience Lead at Uber, Sonarcast 1

   Messaging is a radically different medium than channels businesses are
   most familiar with: email, social, or push. You can’t just cut and
   paste a five-step conversion funnel, graft it onto SMS, and call it a
   day.

   As tech analyst Ben Thompson points out, conversion funnels typically
   look something like this:

   funnel-600x348

   (source: Stratechery)

   Google owns the bottom of the funnel because it can put people in front
   of items they already want to buy. As Thompson astutely remarks, the
   impact of messaging will be seen in the middle of the funnel by moving
   customers faster from interest to action through 1:1 communications.

   Breaking down your funnel and figuring out the number of steps between
   acquisition and conversion is crucial for tracking how well you’re
   meeting your business objectives. But you need to balance this with an
   understanding that messaging and SMS is all about establishing a
   two-way dialogue with your customer.

   The three basic phases of the SMS lifecycle are:
    1. Onboarding: Get to know you through progressive conversational
       profiling
    2. Activation: Show the value of the product and get the user to the
       aha moment
    3. Conversion: Answer questions, provide support, and lead the
       customer to a purchase decision

   Let’s take a look at how this works in practice.

Onboarding: The “Meet and Greet Message”

   First impressions matter. The way you interact with a customer for the
   first time sets the stage for the rest of the relationship. As Pulkit
   Agrawal, CEO of user onboarding tool Chameleon writes, “Great
   onboarding is only the first step towards an amazing customer
   experience that actually retains users.” That’s why user onboarding is
   so important for web and mobile apps.

   It’s no different for your messaging strategy. If you want to establish
   a dialogue over SMS or Facebook Messenger, you have to set the tone
   right. Even if you have a simple goal, don’t make it purely
   transactional:

   nj-dental

   Instead, use the opportunity to learn more about them and get them
   hooked on your service. Because we all check our phones all the time,
   SMS is an extremely effective channel for engaging and retaining
   customers.

   This is something that the founders of Drinkeasy, an on-demand service
   that ships craft beer, wine discovered. Their first forays into SMS led
   to much higher adoption and repurchase rates than they saw with their
   native mobile app—leading them to scrap the mobile app in favor of SMS.

   Drinkeasy’s SMS onboarding cycle begins with one simple goal—figuring
   out what kind of alcohol new customers like to drink.

   drinkeasy-lifecycle-sms-1


   drinkeasy-lifecycle-sms-2

   Instead of asking new customers for this information point-blank, they
   take the time to provide context around why they’re asking. It’s not
   too different from how you’d normally talk.

   Within the first five minutes of texting Drinkeasy, the company is able
   to achieve four things:
    1. Explain what Drinkeasy does.
    2. Outline terms of service in plain English.
    3. Learns the customer’s name (Sasha), liquor preference, name, and
       zip code.
    4. Gather all the info needed to give Sasha her first drink
       recommendation, and one that she’s likely to buy!

   For Sasha, there’s a low barrier to entry for the service. For each bit
   of personal information Drinkeasy asks for, it provides an articulate
   reason for why that will help Sasha. It’s like requesting permissions
   on the app store, only Sasha doesn’t even have to download an app.

   Even if Sasha doesn’t immediately make a purchase, it opens the doors
   for the relationship. Once you’ve gathered information about the
   customer through conversation, you’ve built a profile that you can use
   for further marketing down the line.

Activation: Cut to the Value

   But once you’ve got your customers hooked, you need to get them to the
   next step of the funnel. For a B2B service, this might appear in a
   12-step automated drip email campaign. With messaging, it’s a little
   different. You’re in a two-sided conversation, which allows you to get
   much more intimate with your customers. But it’s up to you to get the
   conversation going.

   Some of your messaging outreach will be automated, with canned
   responses—that’s what let’s messaging scale. But the trick is to weave
   that seamlessly into when you are talking to customers.

   Don’t come off as obviously a robot, like this automated message from
   1800 contacts does:

   1800contacts-lifecycle-sms

   Instead, map out the conversation. Even if you’re automating parts of
   your messaging flow, make sure that the switch between an auto-reply
   message to a human happens seamlessly.

   Lawtrades, a legal services company, is a great example. Following a
   crisp onboarding sequence, Lawtrades moves straight to getting you on
   the phone with a lawyer:

   lawtrades-lifecycle-sms-1

   Although this sequence is automated, it remains crisp and
   conversational. The moment a customer switches gears, Lawtrades has a
   customer service rep waiting in the wings ready to answer any
   additional questions.

   After being asked the cost of incorporating a company is, she also can
   give guidance on an LLC:

   lawtrades-lifecycle-sms-2

   The main value that Lawtrades provides is the ability to get you on the
   phone with a lawyer, as quickly as possible. But customers often have
   questions before they’re willing to commit—that’s why they’re texting
   you in the first place.

   By adopting a mix of automated and personalized messaging, you can give
   them the information they need to take the next step.

Conversion: Closing the deal via text

   Just like in people-to-people sales, getting your customers to buy
   things over text means helping them and building trust. It’s not just a
   conversions game where you’re trying to squeeze the numbers.

   There’s an art to the close over text messaging, and it’s all about
   getting personal with your customers—not sending discount codes in all
   caps. Launching promotions and discount codes can work extremely well
   when worked into the conversation, but not when they come completely
   from left field:

   landsendsms

   Bohemian Guitars is a company that sells handcrafted guitars. They
   originally got into SMS because they noticed that their website had a
   ton of mobile traffic. It’s secret is that it keeps conversation casual
   and personal—no different from a normal text conversation. The sales
   team helps customers pick guitars by asking them questions about
   playing styles, and teaching them what guitar would suit best.

   When a sales rep doesn’t have an answer, they’re not afraid to say so:

   bohoguitars

   Making sales over text is all about building relationships. The flip
   side is that, as Bohemain Guitar co-founder says, “it is extremely
   important that you don’t abuse your texting-relationship with your
   customers.”

Lifecycle SMS is about Customer Experience

   Part of what makes figuring out SMS so hard for a lot of businesses is
   that there is so much you can do. You can send notifications, marketing
   promotions, provide support and more all through a simple text
   interface.

   You need to remember that messaging works because it facilitates fast,
   asynchronous communication. Rather than requiring customers come onto
   your website, or forcing them in your app, SMS puts you literally in
   the customer’s pocket.

   That means that your lifecycle SMS strategy can’t just be defined by
   what you want. At every stage, from activation to conversion, you need
   to be focused on how you’re making things easier for the customer.

       I completely agree with the new form of messaging that you have put
       forth. It is important to institute what is best in response to the
       customers, in the new ways they respond to advertisements. Certain
       electronic advertisements are beginning to lose their grounds as
       people are in a much faster pace world and do not have time to
       watch a long video or desire to listen to a recording on what the
       company is selling. Finding something as simplistic as SMS
       messaging will allow the customer to respond and acknowledge the
       advertisement on their time while also creating a more relaxed
       business communication. Additionally, this communication can be
       expanded once the relationship is set in stone to allow the company
       to advertise to more advanced form such as the actual company
       website. Therefore, I thoroughly enjoy and agree with the
       information you have presented and hope this form of marketing
       continues to grow.

       This is 100% correct, I developed my own Interactive SMS system to
       do exactly what you are talking about, however I made it more
       humanised and conversational. Its going great. Interactive Text
       Response is its name if you are interested in taking a look.

How to Nail the Bot to Human Handoff

   2016 was supposed to be the year of the chatbot. But while the number
   of companies building chatbots has exploded, chatbots themselves
   haven’t really lived up to the hype. As venture capitalist, Fred Wilson
   wrote, “I would be hard pressed to name a super popular chatbot on
   Messenger, Kik, Slack, and Telegram.”

   The problem is that a lot of chatbots just aren’t advanced enough to
   replace your existing support or sales functions. They’re good at one
   thing—checking the weather, or booking a flight. And even then, they
   often don’t actually make life easier.

   simple Google Search. Image source: Intercom)

   Take Poncho, a chatbot that tells you the weather. It takes around 60
   taps to talk to Poncho and figure out if it will rain tomorrow. It
   takes 16 taps to accomplish the same thing in a simple Google search.

   While Poncho is fun and cool, it doesn’t actually make it easier to
   find the weather than your native weather app. It’s a problem many
   chatbots suffer from—they’re fun and interesting, but don’t bring much
   to the table.

What’s Possible with Messaging Today

   At Sonar, we know that messaging helps businesses build more intimate
   relationships with customers. But today, one of the biggest mistakes
   people make is thinking they can use bots to outsource 100% of customer
   communication. The bots simply aren’t up to the task—yet.

   The hype around chatbots is only a small part of a much bigger trend:
   the fragmentation of communication across customer channels. A 2016
   study shows that 65% of mobile users have used a messaging app to talk
   to a business. An even higher 76% have done so over SMS.

   To really connect to your customers through messaging, you can’t just
   jump on the chatbot trend. You have to consider how messaging fits into
   your larger business strategy.

   These are the three primary ways that businesses today use bots and
   humans to talk to their customers:
    1. Handoff the customer conversation from a bot to humans
    2. Switch requests between bot and human, based on the type of request
    3. Use human agents to ensure the bot runs reliably

   Let’s take a look how companies today are implementing the bot-to-human
   handoff, and tips for how you can do the same.

Route Questions Between Bots and Humans

   According to a report from Twilio, consumers prefer messaging to every
   other channel of customer support. Messaging is a low-stakes way to
   talk directly to a business, without getting stuck in a system of
   support tickets and automated responses.

   Automated chatbots can tell consumers the time a business is open, or
   what a return policy is, but when it comes to offering real support,
   you need to have a human on the other line.

   Let’s take a look at how the Radisson Blu Edwardian Hotel uses
   messaging to provide support to guests:

   Messaging with Edwardian

   (The Edwardian Hotel’s Edward. Image source: Aspect)
    1. Guests send a question or request to Edward
    2. Edward answers common questions, like where the gym is, entirely on
       his own
    3. Edward routes customer requests, like room service, to hotel staff

   Edward uses a rule-based system and Natural Language Understanding
   (NLU) to interpret what guests say to it, and respond appropriately.
   Within a closed system like hotel service, there simply isn’t enough
   data to use machine learning effectively. Tobials Goebel, part of the
   team behind Edward points out that “building a completely unsupervised
   learning bot can backfire quickly.”

   Instead, the team mapped out the different types of requests Edward
   would receive, and built it to respond accordingly:

   For service-heavy industries like hospitality, messaging provides a
   huge opportunity for companies to provide instant support, while
   scaling down costs. Through Edward, guests are able to find information
   they need without having to search the hotel website or call down the
   front desk. It helps the Edwardian cut support costs, while providing
   better and faster service.

Use Humans to Robot-Proof Your Service

   Automating tedious chores like booking flights or scheduling meetings
   are particularly good use-cases for bots—the only problem is that the
   bots aren’t smart enough yet. AI assistants like X.ai and Clara still
   rely on support agents to humanize bots and patch over their mistakes.

   In an interview with Bloomberg, Clara CEO pointed out that she would
   rather build a more expensive, reliable service than a completely
   automated one that gave customers a bad experience.

   Let’s take a look at how SnapTravel, a service that helps travelers
   book hotels accomplishes this.

   SnapTravel Chatbot Messages
    1. SnapTravel’s bot asks for the customer’s travel dates, hotel
       preferences, and budget.
    2. The bot returns with a list of 3 hotels that match the pre-selected
       criteria.
    3. When the bot can’t process the conversation, a support agent is
       ready on the wings to step in.
    4. Each travel booking is approved by a human agent.

   SnapTravel describes itself as a “half-bot half-human service.” Because
   booking a hotel is a pretty cut and dry process, SnapTravel can rely on
   bots to power a big chunk of the conversation with customers. But faced
   with more ambiguous questions, the service falls back onto human
   support representatives.

   SnapTravel Human Step-In

   April steps in to the rescue!

   It’s a smart business model. By providing it’s service across SMS,
   Facebook Messenger, and Slack, SnapTravel creates a low-friction point
   of entry for customers who don’t need a dedicated traveling app.
   Creating a bot allows the company to scale efficiently, while human
   agents ensure that the service works reliably.

Bots Are the Gateway to Messaging

   Bots Landscape

   (VentureBeat’s Bots Landscape infographic shows 170+ companies
   developing bots with $4 billion in total funding. image source:
   VentureBeat)

   There are now over 30,000 chatbots on Facebook Messenger alone. The bot
   landscape is filling up with bots that tell you the weather, schedule
   meetings, and manage your email. Chatbots offer an exciting vision of
   the future where AI and natural language processing allow businesses to
   automate personalized interaction with customers.

   The truth is, we’re not quite there yet.

   At Sonar, we believe that chat is the interface of the future—we built
   our business around it. But what we’ve seen day in and day out is that
   in order for businesses to really succeed on chat, they need a hybrid.
   They need to nail down the bot to human handoff.
