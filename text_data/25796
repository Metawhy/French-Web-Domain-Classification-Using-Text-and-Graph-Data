     * What Causes Cancer?

Acrylamide and Cancer Risk

What is acrylamide?

   Acrylamide is a chemical used in industries such as the paper and pulp,
   construction, foundry, oil drilling, textiles, cosmetics, food
   processing, plastics, mining, and agricultural industries. It is used
   in making paper, dyes, and plastics, and in treating drinking water and
   wastewater.

   Acrylamide can be found in small amounts in consumer products including
   caulk, food packaging, and some adhesives. It is also present in
   cigarette smoke.

   Acrylamide can form naturally from chemical reactions in certain types
   of starchy foods, after cooking at high temperatures. Some foods with
   higher levels of acrylamide include French fries, potato chips, foods
   made from grains (such as breakfast cereals, cookies, and toast), and
   coffee.

Does acrylamide cause cancer?

   In general, the American Cancer Society does not determine if something
   causes cancer (that is, if it is a carcinogen), but we do look to other
   respected organizations for help with this. Based on current research,
   some of these organizations have made the following determinations:
     * The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies
       acrylamide as a “probable human carcinogen.”
     * The US National Toxicology Program (NTP) has classified acrylamide
       as “reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.”
     * The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classifies acrylamide
       as “likely to be carcinogenic to humans.”

   It’s important to note that these determinations are based mainly on
   studies in lab animals, and not on studies of people’s exposure to
   acrylamide from foods. Since the discovery of acrylamide in foods in
   2002, the American Cancer Society, the US Food and Drug Administration
   (FDA), the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Food Safety
   Authority (EFSA), and many other organizations have recognized the need
   for further research on this topic. So far, reviews of studies done in
   groups of people (epidemiologic studies) suggest that dietary
   acrylamide isn’t likely to be related to risk for most common types of
   cancer. But ongoing studies will continue to provide new information on
   whether acrylamide levels in foods are linked to increased cancer risk.

   To learn more about how cancer causes are studied and classified, see
   Known and Probable Human Carcinogens and Does This Cause Cancer?

Are acrylamide levels regulated?

   In the United States, the FDA regulates the amount of residual
   acrylamide in a variety of materials that come in contact with food,
   but there are currently no regulations on the presence of acrylamide in
   food itself. In 2016, the FDA issued guidance to help the food industry
   reduce the amount of acrylamide in certain foods, but these are
   recommendations, not regulations.

   The EPA regulates acrylamide in drinking water. The EPA has set an
   acceptable level of acrylamide exposure, which is low enough to account
   for any uncertainty in the data relating acrylamide to cancer and other
   health effects.

   In the workplace, exposure to acrylamide is regulated by the EPA and
   the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).

Can acrylamide be avoided?

   Some people working in certain industries that are regulated for
   acrylamide need to take precautions to limit their exposure.

   For most people, the major potential sources of acrylamide exposure are
   in certain foods and in cigarette smoke. Avoiding cigarette smoke can
   lower your exposure to this and other harmful chemicals.

   It’s not yet clear if the levels of acrylamide in foods raise cancer
   risk, but if you’re concerned, there are some things you can do to
   lower your exposure. In general, acrylamide levels rise when cooking is
   done for longer periods or at higher temperatures, and when certain
   types of cooking methods are used (such as frying or roasting). Here
   are some ways to reduce exposure to acrylamide in foods, according to
   the FDA:
     * Limit foods that might be high in acrylamide, such as potato
       products (especially French fries and potato chips), coffee, and
       foods made from grains (such as breakfast cereals, cookies, and
       toast).
     * Limit certain cooking methods, such as frying and roasting, and
       limit the time certain foods are cooked. Boiling and steaming do
       not produce acrylamide.
     * Soak raw potato slices in water for 15 to 30 minutes before frying
       or roasting to reduce acrylamide formation during cooking. (Soaked
       potatoes should be drained and blotted dry before cooking to
       prevent splattering or fires.)
     * If frying potatoes or toasting bread, cook them to a lighter color
       (as opposed to dark brown), which produces less acrylamide.
     * Avoid storing potatoes in the refrigerator, which can result in
       increased acrylamide levels during cooking.

     * What Causes Cancer?

Acrylamide and Cancer Risk

What is acrylamide?

   Acrylamide is a chemical used in industries such as the paper and pulp,
   construction, foundry, oil drilling, textiles, cosmetics, food
   processing, plastics, mining, and agricultural industries. It is used
   in making paper, dyes, and plastics, and in treating drinking water and
   wastewater.

   Acrylamide can be found in small amounts in consumer products including
   caulk, food packaging, and some adhesives. It is also present in
   cigarette smoke.

   Acrylamide can form naturally from chemical reactions in certain types
   of starchy foods, after cooking at high temperatures. Some foods with
   higher levels of acrylamide include French fries, potato chips, foods
   made from grains (such as breakfast cereals, cookies, and toast), and
   coffee.

Does acrylamide cause cancer?

   In general, the American Cancer Society does not determine if something
   causes cancer (that is, if it is a carcinogen), but we do look to other
   respected organizations for help with this. Based on current research,
   some of these organizations have made the following determinations:
     * The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies
       acrylamide as a “probable human carcinogen.”
     * The US National Toxicology Program (NTP) has classified acrylamide
       as “reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.”
     * The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classifies acrylamide
       as “likely to be carcinogenic to humans.”

   It’s important to note that these determinations are based mainly on
   studies in lab animals, and not on studies of people’s exposure to
   acrylamide from foods. Since the discovery of acrylamide in foods in
   2002, the American Cancer Society, the US Food and Drug Administration
   (FDA), the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Food Safety
   Authority (EFSA), and many other organizations have recognized the need
   for further research on this topic. So far, reviews of studies done in
   groups of people (epidemiologic studies) suggest that dietary
   acrylamide isn’t likely to be related to risk for most common types of
   cancer. But ongoing studies will continue to provide new information on
   whether acrylamide levels in foods are linked to increased cancer risk.

   To learn more about how cancer causes are studied and classified, see
   Known and Probable Human Carcinogens and Does This Cause Cancer?

Are acrylamide levels regulated?

   In the United States, the FDA regulates the amount of residual
   acrylamide in a variety of materials that come in contact with food,
   but there are currently no regulations on the presence of acrylamide in
   food itself. In 2016, the FDA issued guidance to help the food industry
   reduce the amount of acrylamide in certain foods, but these are
   recommendations, not regulations.

   The EPA regulates acrylamide in drinking water. The EPA has set an
   acceptable level of acrylamide exposure, which is low enough to account
   for any uncertainty in the data relating acrylamide to cancer and other
   health effects.

   In the workplace, exposure to acrylamide is regulated by the EPA and
   the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).

Can acrylamide be avoided?

   Some people working in certain industries that are regulated for
   acrylamide need to take precautions to limit their exposure.

   For most people, the major potential sources of acrylamide exposure are
   in certain foods and in cigarette smoke. Avoiding cigarette smoke can
   lower your exposure to this and other harmful chemicals.

   It’s not yet clear if the levels of acrylamide in foods raise cancer
   risk, but if you’re concerned, there are some things you can do to
   lower your exposure. In general, acrylamide levels rise when cooking is
   done for longer periods or at higher temperatures, and when certain
   types of cooking methods are used (such as frying or roasting). Here
   are some ways to reduce exposure to acrylamide in foods, according to
   the FDA:
     * Limit foods that might be high in acrylamide, such as potato
       products (especially French fries and potato chips), coffee, and
       foods made from grains (such as breakfast cereals, cookies, and
       toast).
     * Limit certain cooking methods, such as frying and roasting, and
       limit the time certain foods are cooked. Boiling and steaming do
       not produce acrylamide.
     * Soak raw potato slices in water for 15 to 30 minutes before frying
       or roasting to reduce acrylamide formation during cooking. (Soaked
       potatoes should be drained and blotted dry before cooking to
       prevent splattering or fires.)
     * If frying potatoes or toasting bread, cook them to a lighter color
       (as opposed to dark brown), which produces less acrylamide.
     * Avoid storing potatoes in the refrigerator, which can result in
       increased acrylamide levels during cooking.
