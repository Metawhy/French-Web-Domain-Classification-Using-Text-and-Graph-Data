What is search intent?

   Avatar of Marieke van de Rakt

   SEO is a way to get more traffic to your website. By ranking high in
   Google, you attract more people to your site. Eventually, your goal
   probably is to sell your stuff or to attract more regular visitors.
   A nice tactic to get more traffic to your site is optimizing your
   content for words people use. However, to really convince people to buy
   your stuff, subscribe to your newsletter or to come back to your
   website another time, you should take into account search intent as
   well. Here, I will tell you what search intent is and how to optimize
   your articles for search intent.

What is search intent?

   Search intent has to do with the reason why people conduct a specific
   search. Why are they searching? Are they searching because they have a
   question and want an answer to that question? Are they searching for a
   specific website? Or, are they searching because they want to buy
   something?

   Over the years, Google has become more and more able to determine the
   search intent of people. And Google wants to rank pages highest that
   fit the search term as well as the search intent of a specific search
   query. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs essential to make sure your post or page fits
   the search intent of your audience.

4 types of search intent

   There are a few distinct types of search intent:

Informational intent

   First, there is informational intent. Lots of searches on the internet
   are of people looking for information. Information about the weather,
   information about educating children, information about SEO. In this
   case, people have a specific question or want to know more about a
   certain topic.

Navigational intent

   The second type of search intent is called navigational intent. People
   with this intent try to get to a specific website. People who search
   for Facebook are usually on their way to the Facebook website.

   Ranking high on a navigational term is only beneficial for your organic
   traffic if your site is the site people are looking for. A few years
   ago, Yoast had a Google Analytics plugin, and we ranked pretty well for
   the term Google Analytics. It didn‚Äôt drive any traffic to our site
   though. People searching for Google Analytics were looking for the
   Google Analytics website and were hardly ever interested in our plugin.

Transactional intent

   The third type of search intent is the transactional intent. Lots of
   people buy stuff on the internet and browse the web to find the best
   purchase. People who have the intention to buy are searching with a
   transactional intent.

Commercial investigation

   Some people have the intention to buy in the (near) future, but use the
   web to do their research. What washing machine would be best? Which SEO
   plugin is the most helpful? These people also have transactional intent
   but will need some more time and convincing. These types of search
   intents are usually called commercial investigating intents.

Keyword intent

   The words people use in their search queries will give information
   about their user intent. If people use words like buy, deal, discount,
   they are definitely prone to buy something. Also, if people are
   searching for specific products, they probably want to buy it. If
   people are searching and use words like information, how to, best way
   to, you‚Äôll know they‚Äôll have an informational search intent.

How to optimize your content for search intent

   You want to make sure that a landing page fits the search intent of
   your audience. If people search for information, you don‚Äôt want to show
   them a product page. At least, not immediately. You‚Äôd probably scare
   them away. If people want to buy your product, do not bore them with
   long articles. Lead them to your shop.

   Optimizing your product pages for more commercial driven keywords is a
   good idea. If you sell dog vitamins, you could, for instance, optimize
   a product page for [buy dog vitamins]. Perhaps you also have an article
   about administering vitamins. You could, for example, optimize that
   article for the search term [how to give vitamins to my dog].

   It can be quite hard to determine the search intent of a query. And,
   perhaps different users will have a (slightly) different user intent,
   but still land on the same page. If you want to know more about the
   search intent of your audience, the best way is to ask them. You could
   make a small survey, containing questions about what people were
   searching for and make that survey pop up if people enter your website.
   That‚Äôll probably give more insights into the search intent of your
   audience.

Conclusion

   It‚Äôs crucial to ensure that the content you‚Äôre writing fits both the
   terms people are searching for, as well as the search intent of your
   audience. Make sure your post or page is informational, if people are
   searching for information. But lead people to your sales pages if they
   are prone to buying one of your products.

       Good tips. I have found out that the long term keyword works best,
       because that guides the content writing well. And the more LSI long
       term search terms you use, the better. You just cannot write off
       the topic.
          + Melina Reintjens
            Melina Reintjens  ‚Ä¢ 2 years ago
            You‚Äôre absolutely right, long tail keywords are a crucial part
            of a keyword strategy! But actually, we‚Äôre not so sure LSI
            keywords are all they‚Äôre made out to be. Edwin recently wrote
            about that: https://yoast.com/semantically-link-entities/ .

       Nicely written, I see many bloggers missing the point. Attracting
       users with informational content and trying hard to sell affiliates
       products. This should be on top of my while creating an content
       strategy for the blog.

            Hi Richard, Try to find out what your target audience is
            looking for. E.g. Information about a certain topic, or
            products to buy? Make sure your content fits this intent!
   13. Michael LaRocca
       Michael LaRocca  ‚Ä¢ 2 years ago
       Excellent advice as always. One thing to keep in mind is not ‚ÄúWhat
       would I search for?‚Äù but ‚ÄúWhat would my prospect search for?‚Äù Note
       that I chose the word ‚Äúprospect.‚Äù I did this because, as you noted,
       it‚Äôs not always a customer doing the searching. At least not yet‚Ä¶

   One of the features of Yoast SEO Premium is the possibility to optimize
   your posts for related keyphrases and synonyms. And, what‚Äôs more, it
   will also recognize different word forms of the words of your
   keyphrase. Read on and learn what this feature can do for you and why
   we think it‚Äôs so awesome!

   Or, just watch this video:

   IFRAME:
   https://www.youtube.com/embed/_NkVYAJGhhc?start=2&feature=oembed

   If you want a post to rank for a certain keyword or phrase you have to
   optimize your content for that keyphrase. This focus keyphrase can be
   one word, but it‚Äôs more likely to be a phrase or part of a sentence.
   When optimizing your content for that focus keyphrase, our Yoast SEO
   plugin is a great help. It runs a check on your content to find out if
   you‚Äôre using your focus keyphrase enough ‚Äì but not too much ‚Äì and in
   the right spots. It does so in real time, so you can optimize your text
   while you‚Äôre writing!

Synonyms

   If you want to write an article that is nice and easy to read, you‚Äôll
   probably use synonyms of your focus keyword throughout your text.
   That‚Äôs excellent, because repeating your exact focus keyphrase often
   impairs readability. Using synonyms is a way to help users understand
   your copy better and search engines will recognize these synonyms too.
   They‚Äôll understand your text is still on topic!

   For instance, if you want to optimize for [dog game], you could, and
   probably will, use [dog sport] as a synonym now and then. This will
   make your text a much nicer read!

   In Yoast SEO Premium you can add these synonyms of your focus
   keyphrase, and we‚Äôll be able to see if you‚Äôve used those synonyms in,
   for instance, your meta description, introduction, subheadings or image
   alt text. Moreover, our keyphrase distribution check will reward you
   for alternately using your keyphrase, and it‚Äôs synonyms throughout your
   text.

How do you add synonyms?

   Adding synonyms is easy! Just enter one or more synonyms in the field
   next to your focus keyword. If you have more than one, separate them by
   commas:

Related keyphrases

   Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to choose one keyphrase, because you want a post
   not only to rank for th√°t focus keyphrase, but also for a slightly
   different, but related keyphrase. Since Google has been getting better
   at recognizing relationships between topics, it‚Äôs smart to optimize
   your post for relevant, related keyphrases.

   For instance, if you want to optimize for [dog game], you might want to
   optimize for some of these games too, like [flyball] or [treasure
   hunt].

   Luckily, our related keyphrase feature can help you out. It allows you
   to easily add related keyphrases. These keyphrases get a slightly
   different treatment than your focus keyword, as they‚Äôre not the main
   keyphrase you‚Äôre optimizing for. Our assessment is less strict, so it‚Äôs
   easier to get a green bullet for your related keyphrase.

How do you add related keyphrases?

   Just click on ‚ÄúAdd related keyphrase‚Äù in the Yoast SEO Premium meta box
   to add a new keyphrase. It will unfold and you can enter the keyphrase
   in the related keyphrase field. It will run a check and you can find
   your score next to your focus keyphrase:

Word form recognition

   If you write in English, you‚Äôll love this feature! Yoast SEO Premium
   recognizes different word forms of your keyphrase (just in English for
   now). This means it will recognize singular and plurals, but also
   different tenses of verbs. This is awesome, because it will allow you
   to write in a natural and free way and get green bullets too!

   So, if your focus keyphrase is [dog game], it will recognize Read about
   these games for dogs too. Or, if you want to optimize for [play
   flyball] it will recognize the sentence, I love playing flyball with my
   dog as well.

   This infographic summarizes the entire concept of synonyms, related
   keywords and word forms:

Keyphrase distribution

   Word forms and synonym recognition all come together in one awesome
   feature: Keyphrase distribution. This premium-only check goes through
   your copy and assesses where you‚Äôve used your keyphrase, its synonyms,
   or different words forms from the words in your keyphrase. If you get a
   green bullet, you‚Äôve stayed on topic and probably found a nice balance
   in using all of those words. The best way to make your readers and
   Google happy!
