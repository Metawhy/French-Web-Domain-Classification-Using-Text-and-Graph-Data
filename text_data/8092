Our Story

   It didn't take long during our first year at the Stanford Graduate
   School of Business (GSB) for the 11 members of our Giving Circle to
   become close friends.  We are all very social and spent many-a-night
   swapping stories and sharing dreams over dinner and a glass of wine (or
   maybe a little tequila). In addition to stories about school, men and
   careers, it didn't take long to realize we all shared a similar
   interest in the social sector and a particular interest in helping
   girls and women achieve their dreams.
   Each of us had experience working with organizations from our
   respective countries, but wanted to find a more meaningful way to add
   value to these organizations and stay involved with them over the
   long-haul.  Our group members' origins span eight countries including
   Turkey, Lebanon, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Nigeria, Botswana, England and the
   U.S. so we have first-hand developing country knowledge and hopefully
   some great opportunities toconnect with women in various parts of the
   world.
   Olaolu, Robin and Yessica had heard of several other groups of women
   starting Giving Circles, and thought it might be a good fit.  After
   researching the topic, we decided it was the perfect mechanism for our
   group.  In a nutshell, we pick one organization each year dedicated to
   empowering women or girls, and we provide them with a personal
   financial donation as well as advisory services and (wo)man hours to
   execute projects. It is also an amazing opportunity for the 11 of us to
   stay close as we move beyond graduation!

   2017 - 2018, Year 7: Komera
   In 2017/2018 we partnered with Komera, an organization based in Rwanda
   that focuses on three main pillars:
   Education: Komera sponsors scholars with full tuition, including room
   and board at a public boarding school in Rwanda. Komera also provides
   intensive leadership and social entrepreneurship training during
   holidays.
   Community: Komera builds a local community of support for the scholars.
   At school, a scholar meets with her Komera mentor and fellow scholars
   once a week. At home, her parents work with the Komera Parent
   Co-Operative.
   Sport: Komera is unique because of its emphasis on empowerment and
   positive body image through sport. There is an annual Komera Global Run
   in June.
   This year, 11Empowered teamed up with St. Frank, a unique retail brand
   that partners with entrepreneurial artisan organizations that transform
   the communities in which they work by providing quality jobs, training,
   and other holistic support to artisans. The collaboration raised
   $11,764 in support of Komera's efforts. ​

   2016 - 2017, Year 6: Intaliqi
   In 2016 we partnered with Intaliqi, an organization that empowers
   socially disadvantaged women, mostly Syrian refugees, and helps them
   lead better lives for themselves, their families and their
   communities. Since 2013, Intaliqi has been working in makeshift
   settlements in Lebanon. Intaliqi started a kitchen in one of the
   refugee camps in the Bekaa valley, where women cook all day to provide
   meals for the community. By giving them the opportunity, they are also
   given their dignity back. 11Empowered raised $11,000 to launch
   the Intaliqi-Empowered11 Empowerment Agricultural Program, which falls
   within Intaliqi’s initiatives to empower refugee women to become
   self-sufficient and agents of change within their communities.

   The program’s objectives are to:
   * Empower displaced Syrian women refugees by providing them with
   employment, awareness, and training
   * Nourish the displaced community with local and organic food
   * Establish relationships between Empowered 11 and sponsored women

   To accomplish these objectives Intaliqi leased a 7,000 square
   meters land in Majdal 3anjar in the Bekaa valley. The plot is
   strategically located next to a clean water source and the region has a
   reputation of being the agriculture center of Lebanon. The program is
   divided into 3 phases:
     * Phase 1: improving the quality of the soil following the winter
       season
     * Phase 2: plantation, maintenance and harvest, and finally
     * Phase 3: distributing and processing the produce.

   2015 - 2016, Year 5: Global AIDS Interfaith Alliance (GAIA)
   In 2015 we partnered with GAIA, which is an organization that develops
   innovative and caring healthcare programs in resource-deprived regions
   in Africa, especially those most affected by HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis,
   and malaria. GAIA’s programs seek to empower girls and women, emphasize
   prevention, and expand access. The organization was founded in 2000 by
   Dr. William Rankin, former Dean of the Episcopal Divinity School in
   Cambridge, MA, and Dr. Charles Wilson, M.D., Professor Emeritus of
   Neurological Surgery, UCSF, in response to the devastating HIV/AIDS
   epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa. GAIA’s founding Country Director, Jones
   Laviwa, MA, a Malawian development professional, was succeeded in 2015
   by Joyce Jere, RN, MPH, a Malawian nurse with vast experience in both
   clinical work and administration. Under Joyce's leadership, the Malawi
   staff has grown to a team of 64, two-thirds of them are women.
   Currently, GAIA's works spans three countries:
   LIBERIA
   Nursing Scholarship: support to 8 students in response to the Ebola
   epidemic.
   MALAWI
   Mobile Clinics: basic health services at 7 clinics serving 2 districts
   and more than 900,000 people in southern, rural Malawi.
   Nursing Scholarship: support to 500+ students since 2005 with more than
   380 graduates working in 28 districts in Malawi.​
   Targeted Community Programs: prevention, testing and linkage to care
   for those most at risk of HIV/AIDS
   ​SOUTH AFRICA
   Health Worker Scholarships: support to 2 students (Faculty Development

2014 - 2015, Year 4: Akili Dada
This year we are partnering with Akili Dada, a wonderful organization based
in Nairobi whose mission is to cultivate female leaders to build the future
of Kenya.
They target young, academically gifted but underprivileged women across Kenya
and provide them access to high school education, mentorship, internships,
leadership training, social entrepreneurship opportunities, and more. Founded
in 2005, they have provided 61 scholarships to support girls through high
school. 100% of their scholars qualify for scholarships to universities in
Kenya and globally. 100 Kenyan women are providing regular mentoring
activities. Alumnae have been placed in 26 internships often with NGOs and 5
fellowships have been granted to alumni to create social enterprises in
Kenya.
We feel Akili Dada is perfectly aligned with our mission and we are excited
to work alongside them this year. We ultimately raised $11,880 to support the
organization!

   ​2013 - 2014, Year 3: Semillas
   This year we are partnering with Semillas, a Mexican women's community
   foundation that provides grants and technical assistance to women's
   groups advancing the social, political, and economic rights of women in
   Mexico.
   Specifically, we are trying to raise over $15,000 to fund Sbejel
   Ansetik Sociedad Cooperativa, based in Guaquitepec Chilón, Chiapas.
   This women’s cooperative was founded in 2012 by former Semillas
   grantee, Anita Gómez, with the goal to strengthen the economic
   autonomy of indigenous Tseltal women. The project will strengthen the
   abilities of 48 women to produce and sell natural products including
   marmalade, soap and artisan work. The project will also train sexual
   and reproductive health promoters specializing in women’s reproductive
   rights with the aim of decreasing maternal mortality. Further, this
   project will continue to develop Anita ́s leadership skills, as she has
   proven herself to be a strong voice, role model and advocate in the
   region.
   We are excited to support this ambitious project!

2012 - 2013, Year 2: Camfed
Camfed fights poverty and HIV/AIDS in Africa by educating girls and empowering
women to become leaders of change. Their mission is to improve the lives of two
million children by 2013. They have a girl-centric approach and a long-term
program that provides long-term support via school fees, supplies, uniforms,
etc. They offer business training and small grants to women through their Seed
Money Program. The also empower women by providing a supportive alumni network.
Here the background story on Camfed:
In 1991, Founder, Ann Cotton, visited Zimbabwe to investigate why girls’ school
enrollment in rural areas was so low. What she found surprised her. Contrary to
the common assumption that families weren’t sending girls to school for cultural
reasons, Ann discovered poverty was the main roadblock. In her first year, she
raised funds through grass-roots efforts and sent 32 to girls to school. In
1993, Camfed was formalized.
Their target and impact to date:
Camfed services 2,517 communities in Zimbabwe, Zambia, Ghana, Malawi and
Tanzania. Camfed has supported 602,405 girls and vulnerable boys through school,
taught 20,216 young women basic economic skills and helped 6,915 young women
launch small businesses. Our work has also started a local philanthropic
movement: Cama members have helped 161,300 children go to school.
Camfed USA is based in San Francisco but focuses its efforts on Sub-Saharan
Africa.

Amazing Visit with our Semillas Grantee
     __________________________________________________________________

   On May 1, 2014, the 11 Empowered members (along with the gracious help
   of our inspiring Semillas lead, Laura Garcia) visited the recipients of
   our fundraising efforts, the indigenous Tseltal women who are setting
   up a women's cooperative in Chiapas, Mexico, called Sbejel Ansetik
   Sociedad Cooperativa.  The project goal is to strengthen the economic
   autonomy of these resilient women by forming a cooperative that
   produces and sells natural products ranging from coffee to marmalade to
   artisan work.
   Our donation helped them establish the cooperative and provide initial
   working capital to get it off the ground. In addition to the economic
   lift this cooperative provides, there are profound indirect benefits
   including giving the women an opportunity to get out their isolated
   homes and bond with the other women. At the bi-monthly meetings, they
   are also trained on sexual and reproductive health aimed at decreasing
   maternal and infant mortality and increasing family planning.
   We had the opportunity to meet and spend time with the project lead,
   Anita Gómez, who is from the region and is spearheading these grass
   roots efforts. We watched as she ran a cooperative meeting and
   graciously served us lunch in her home.  She was a remarkable woman
   whose leadership and presence was felt despite the language barrier.
   You can feel the passion and determination to overcome
   the startlingly discrimination against women and slowly, patiently
   change the mindset of the men in the region. Grassroots efforts take
   time but we could feel the beginning of an important shift. We were
   truly honored to meet the women who will help make it a reality and
   lift their families up out of poverty and towards a better life.

   Running to Raise Money for Semillas
   On October 12, 2013, the 11 Empowered members participated in 10K races
   in San Francisco and New York. We had a great time, and most
   importantly, with the help of our generous donors, we surpassed our
   goal of $15,000, raising a total of $16,936 for Semillas!
   Huge thank you to all of our donors. We couldn't have done it without
   you!

Training to help Entrepreneurs

   Picture
   An exciting day for 11Empowered!  On May 16, 2010, Katie, an employee
   from Women's Initiative, was gracious enough to come to Stanford's
   campus for our Volunteer Initiation.  She patiently answered each of
   our million questions and gave us a great first impression of the
   organization!  They are such a tremendous fit with our mission and it
   became obvious that working with them is going to be a lot of fun!
   We were very impressed by the rigorous training program they have in
   place to help female entrepreneurs get their businesses off the
   grounds. They are in the perfect phase too - not so small where our
   desire to volunteer becomes overwhelming but not too big where we can't
   add some value.  In fact, everyone in the room was getting excited
   thinking of possible places we can help.
   In April 2011, Karla "Moneybags" Burkitbayeva presented Katie with our
   initial donations, and we are anxiously awaiting our first project!
