   TESTBIRDS EXCLUSIVES: End-to-End Testing
   “With the support of Testbirds and the members of their crowd of
   testers we were able to detect critical errors and bugs which we had
   never located within hours before launch. […] We were also impressed by
   Testbirds’ flexibility and their ideas regarding tester recruitment.”
   Jann Kirchhoff | Product Success Manager Connected Ride Digital
   Services & Apps @ BMW Motorrad
   End-to-End Testing  Case Study

Otto

   QUALITY ASSURANCE: Exploratory Bug Testing
   “By crowdtesting on the right devices with the right browser versions
   and operating systems, Testbirds helps us deliver more
   customer-friendly websites and keep them customer-friendly (…) We have
   a continuous process of change, adjustment and improvement. Testbirds
   offer their testing solutions with the same flexibility and agility,
   which made us decide to embed their testing services continuously into
   our development cycle.”
   Corny van de Wal, Team Manager Shop Development & Production
   Exploratory Bug Test  Case Study

Celonis

   TESTBIRDS EXCLUSIVES: BugAbility™
   “After we came to the conclusion that internal testing simply is not
   enough for us anymore, we decided to do Crowdtesting. If the product
   reaches a certain degree of complexity, internal testing requires too
   many resources. Furthermore, unbiased testers find mistakes, which
   would remain undiscovered otherwise.”
   Manuel Haug, Head of Product Management Core at Celonis
   BugAbility™  Case Study

VEON

   USABILITY & UX: Usability & Vergleichsstudie
   “The results of the A/B comparison UI test for content discovery on
   VEON had a direct impact on the platform and business and we are
   grateful for Testbird’s efforts. I wouldn’t hesitate to work with them
   again.”
   David Kane, Director of Editorial Content, VEON

Landal GreenParks

   USABILITY & UX: Usability & UX-Study
   “Working with Testbirds led to us professionalising our testing
   process, as it forced us to critically examine our own testing
   structure.(..) It’s a powerful addition to our development process.”
   Lieven Swinnen, Manager e-Business Landal GreenParks
   Usability & UX-Study  Case Study

Deutsche Telekom

   TESTBIRDS EXCLUSIVES: End-to-End-Test
   “The communication between Telekom, Testbirds and the client
   development department was very helpful. With the aid of Testbirds we
   were able to identify and fix bugs as well as gather deep and direct
   feedback from our customers, which we wouldn’t have found otherwise.”

Usability is a decisive factor to the success of your applications

   If a website or application does not match the wishes of its user or if
   users are unable to easily fulfil the intended actions, alternatives
   offered by competitors are often just a click away. Seemingly small
   features like headlines or an image next to the “buy” button can have
   serious consequences. Therefore, aspects like testing a menu navigation
   with card sorting or text to image ratio can be hugely influential.
   Although developers and designers are experts when it comes to their
   company’s software and digital products, they are unable to provide an
   unbiased view due to operational blindness.

   User surveys and interviews are an effort and cost intensive process
   and are therefore often left out of the development process. Testbirds
   can address this issue by gathering invaluable usability feedback from
   your customers.

How can Testbirds and crowdtesting help you?

   We test apps, websites, Internet of Things devices, software and games.
   To test the usability of your digital products, we consult users from
   your target group in a structured manner by giving them typical tests
   in the form of uses cases that are performed under real world
   conditions. Be it the registration process of a webshop, testing the
   video features of a fitness app or checking the navigation function of
   public transport, with the crowd you can perform nearly every use case
   you can imagine. Is the target group of your fitness app male and
   between 18 to 39 years old with higher education and from Spain and
   Portugal? We are able to give you access to the exact testers that fit
   your target group in our international crowd.
