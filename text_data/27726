   USER LICENSE AGREEMENT, DO NOT USE THE VPBX SERVICE, INSTALL VPBX

   1.1 License Agreement

   VPBX grants You a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-assignable,
   non-transferable, non-resellable license and right to use the Services
   within the terms set forth in this Agreement. All rights not expressly
   granted under this Agreement are specifically withheld and reserved by
   VPBX. Said reservation of VPBX’s rights include, but are not limited
   to, rights to any and all patents, source code, copyrights, trademarks,
   service marks, trade secrets, proprietary processes, and all other
   intellectual property rights that may be related to, or found in, Your
   Service. You agree to not take, or cause to take, any actions that
   could limit or interfere with the aforementioned reserved rights
   (examples include, but are not limited to modification of function,
   creation of works derived from VPBX source whether reverse engineered,
   inferred or decompiled) and further affirm that any actions taken,
   whether intentional, unintentional or inadvertent, constitute a
   violation of this Agreement and are subject to, with or without notice,
   Service suspension, cancellation, termination or other action as deemed
   appropriate at the sole discretion of VPBX. Upon termination of the
   Service for any reason, Your right to use the Service immediately
   ceases. You shall have no right and VPBX will have no obligation
   thereafter to forward any unread or unsent messages to You or any third
   party.

   You may not resell or transfer Your Service or Your Device(s) or
   provide a telephone service to anyone else by using Your Service or
   features of Your Service without prior written consent from VPBX .

   1.2 Disclosures and other pertinent information

   You represent and warrant that You are at least 18 years of age possess
   the legal right and ability to enter into this Agreement. You further
   affirm You will provide or have provided to VPBX in connection with
   Your registration for Service, true, accurate, current and complete
   name(s) (personal and/or business), address(es) (physical and/or
   billing and/or shipping), credit card/payment information and the E911
   address(es) for all devices requiring E911 registration. You agree to
   provide VPBX any additional and/or supportive detail (by way of
   example, valid photo ID, Credit Card authorization form or supplemental
   form(s), etc.) which VPBX, in its sole discretion, determines may be
   required to activate, reactivate or continue Your service.

   If You provide information that is, or that VPBX suspects to be, false,
   misleading, inaccurate, not current, incomplete, fraudulent, or
   otherwise suspicious, VPBX has the right, in its sole discretion, to
   suspend or terminate Your Service and refuse any and all current or
   future use of all Services by You. You agree and authorize VPBX to ask
   consumer reporting agencies or trade references to furnish VPBX with
   employment and credit information, and You consent to VPBX rechecking
   this information from time to time. You understand VPBX may, and
   authorize VPBX to, report personal and/or business payment and credit
   history or any other information in the possession of VPBX as deemed
   necessary to collect a debt, or as required by law.

   In the process of establishing or maintaining Service, VPBX may, at its
   sole discretion, require that you make, or increase a deposit. Said
   deposit(s) will be held as a partial guarantee of payment and cannot be
   used by You to pay Your bill or delay payment. Unless otherwise
   required by law, deposits may be mixed with other funds and will not
   earn interest. If You Default (as described in a section following) or
   this Agreement is terminated, VPBX may, without notice to You, apply
   any deposit towards payment of charges due. If VPBX refunds the deposit
   to You, depending on Your current payment method, said refund will
   either be refunded to the credit card on file or sent to You by United
   States first class mail to Your last known address.

   At VPBX’s sole discretion, You may start to utilize Services prior to
   conducting, or the completion of, a credit review. VPBX reserves the
   right to subsequently demand a security deposit from You based on the
   results of credit reviews or other performance metrics.

   As part of the credit card verification process, VPBX may place a $1.00
   hold on Your credit card. This hold will typically release within four
   business days but is subject to the terms and conditions of Your
   financial institution.

   You consent to VPBX monitoring and/or recording calls placed by You to
   VPBX concerning Your account or the Service and You consent to VPBX
   contacting You from time to time.

   1.3 Other Conditions of Use

   1.3.1 Emergency Services, 911 and E911

   You represent and warrant that You understand VoIP-based services –
   including the connection or establishment of VoIP calls to 911 – are
   subject to the vagaries of the Internet, and as such are inherently
   unreliable. To that end, You represent and warrant that You have and
   will maintain at all times a traditional Plain Old Telephone Service
   (POTS) telephone line, wireless or cellular service that will enable
   You to call 911 and any other applicable emergency service number.
   Emergency 911 services are offered by VPBX on a best-effort basis as
   part of VBX’s VoIP phone Service and are made available to physical
   VoIP phones when located in the United States and Canada and registered
   with VPBX’s Service (“E911-Available Device”).

   You represent and warrant that You understand Emergency 911 services
   (including Enhanced 911 or “E911″) provided by VPBX may differ in
   certain respects from the emergency calling services provided by a
   traditional wire-line telecommunications provider. These differences
   may have an adverse impact upon the ability or timeliness of the
   provisioning or dispatching of emergency services to You or others in
   the event of an emergency. In addition, due to limitations on
   technology, the location reported by VBPX to the public safety
   dispatcher for Your telephone may not include Your specific location
   within a business premise.

   You are responsible for the accurate reporting and updating of the
   physical location where the Service is to be used for each
   E911-Available Device, and for instructing each E911-Available Device
   user that s/he must provide VPBX with the specific location in which
   they are located within Your premises in the event of an emergency. You
   are required to maintain valid E911 addresses for each of Your physical
   locations where Your Service is deployed. Should an emergency arise,
   emergency services may be delayed or unable to respond to Your needs if
   Your Service does not have a valid E911 address on file. Not keeping
   VPBX apprised of the physical location of an E911-Available Device
   could result in a charge of $150 to Your account.

   You represent and warrant that You understand that in the event any
   E911-Available Device used to access Service via the Internet, is moved
   to another location with suitable Internet access, even though You will
   be able to use the Service without interruption it may take time to
   update emergency dispatch information, which could result in the
   failure to dispatch emergency personnel to the proper location. The
   documentation that accompanies each E911-Available Device that You
   purchase from VPBX includes a sticker concerning the potential
   non-availability of traditional 911 or E911 services (the “911
   Sticker”). It is Your responsibility, in accordance with the
   instructions that accompany each E911-Available Device, to place the
   911 Sticker on or near each E911-Available Device that You use with the
   Service. If You did not receive a 911 Sticker with Your E911-Available
   Device, or You require additional 911 Stickers, please contact Customer
   Support at 888-825-0800 option “2” or email [email protected].

   Enhanced 911 service has several limitations. Such limitations,
   including those discussed above, may prevent You from making emergency
   calls and include but are not limited to any of the following:
     * Loss of electrical power
     * Loss of Internet connection for any reason
     * Defective customer premises equipment (CPE)
     * Network congestion
     * Delays from updating Your registered Service Address
     * The VPBX E911 Service is not available for Devices or addresses
       outside the United States or Canada.

   You should inform all employees who may have access to the VPBX E911
   service, about this section of the Agreement and make sure they
   understand the terms and conditions under which the E911 service is
   available. In addition, they should use the following guidelines with
   respect to the service:
     * Do not hang up on an E911 emergency service call unless and until
       instructed to do so by the 911 operator.
     * If the call is disconnected for any reason, immediately attempt to
       dial 911 again.
     * Be prepared to give Your physical address and a call-back phone
       number.

   The FCC has an informative guide on VoIP and 911 Service that should be
   read thoroughly. This FCC guide can be accessed via the following URL:
   http://www.fcc.gov/guides/voip-and-911-service

   1.3.2 Access to the Internet and Availability of Service

   When using VoIP or other Internet-based VPBX Services You acknowledge
   You must have operational and properly configured access to the
   Internet and hereby agree to provide, at Your sole expense, Your own
   Internet service with a third party provider. You further agree to be
   responsible for payment of any and all Internet service fees including
   all equipment necessary to establish and maintain a connection to the
   Internet as may be required to use VPBX Services.

   Service availability and level(s) may vary due to conditions beyond the
   control of VPBX, including the type and state of the Your equipment.
   Service is subject to interruption or limitation due to factors
   including but not limited to: network capacity limitations,
   installation, repair, modification to the network, restrictions by
   VPBX’s long-distance providers, VPBX’s efforts to combat fraudulent
   use, non-payment, or other legitimate business and operational reasons.

   Notwithstanding the foregoing, You represent and warrant that You
   understand VoIP-based services are subject to the vagaries of the
   Internet, and as such are inherently unreliable. You affirm VPBX has no
   duty under this Agreement to provide insurance to Your benefit against
   any losses caused by interruption of Service, whether caused by
   disrupted access to the Internet, acts of God, scheduled maintenance
   windows or other reasons whether reasonably seen or unforeseen.

   1.3.3 Acceptance of Financial Responsibility & Default

   You are responsible for paying all charges to Your account for
   Services, whether said charges result from use authorized or use
   unauthorized by You, including but not limited to, long distance and
   directory assistance charges and for all taxes and surcharges imposed
   on You or VPBX as a result of Your use of the Service. Long distance
   usage on each call is billed in one-minute increments and the cost is
   then rounded up to the nearest cent. During the Term of this Agreement,
   VPBX reserves the right to change rates, terms, fees or taxes (as
   imposed by the applicable taxing authority) on, or discontinue its
   offering of, any feature of the Service. At the end of Your Term, or
   during any subsequent month-to-month period, VPBX reserves the right to
   change or discontinue any rate plan available to You. VirtualPBX
   reserves the right to impose an annual 3% increase in service fees on
   any plan type, paid monthly, monthly with contract, or annually, with
   no further notice to you.

   Service under this Agreement is subject to sales, use, gross receipts,
   and other taxes (other than a tax imposed upon the net income of VPBX),
   assessments, fees, surcharges, or other governmental charges relating
   to the services provided, whether or not denominated as a tax and
   whether imposed now or in the future upon You or VPBX. Taxes,
   surcharges, and assessments may be changed or added in accordance with
   the applicable taxing authority. Should VPBX be required to pay such
   taxes and/or fees on Your behalf as described herein, or taxes and/or
   fees which the liability post-dates this Agreement (e.g. future taxes
   and/or fees), You agree that You are liable for such taxes and/or fees
   and authorize the immediate charge of Your payment method on file for
   the full amount due.

   Any applicable installation charges and annual maintenance fees are
   paid for by You in advance. Should You be on an annual plan You will be
   billed on a monthly basis for normal usage, or for any taxes and
   incidental charges. Should Your call traffic exceed a specified maximum
   amount in a given period, both of which are set at the absolute and
   sole discretion of VPBX, at any time during Your billing cycle, VPBX
   reserves the right to immediately and without notice, debit Your
   payment method for monthly traffic costs that have been thus far
   accrued on Your account. This policy typically applies to accounts less
   than 180 days old; however, the policy may be expanded should VPBX deem
   it warranted. If You would like to know the maximum threshold on Your
   Service, please email [email protected].

   You shall pay all bills in full by the due date on the bill. Payment
   will be deemed made when received by VPBX unless payment is by means of
   a check that is later dishonored or by a credit card that is
   subsequently charged-back. There will be a $5.00 check processing fee
   assessed monthly. You must give VPBX written notice of any reasonable
   disputes that include clear and precise descriptions regarding the
   disputed charges appearing on Your bill within 30 days of the date of
   the disputed bill. Otherwise, all charges will be deemed correct and
   You waive any future recourse with respect to said bill and/or charges.
   All undisputed charges on the bill are due by or on the bill due date.

   If You have authorized payment by credit card, no additional notice or
   consent will be required for billings to said credit card or account.
   You will advise VPBX of any changes to Your credit card account, such
   as account number or expiration date changes, etc. VPBX accepts credit
   and debit cards issued by most banks. Prepaid payment methods of any
   type are not accepted. Virtual/disposable credit cards are accepted
   from a limited list of financial institutions and subject to VPBX
   review. VPBX reserves the right to require prepaid or
   virtual/disposable payment methods be replaced with an actual credit
   card within two business days of notification. Failure to replace
   prepaid or virtual/disposable credit cards will result in account
   suspension. VPBX reserves the right to suspend Service for any accounts
   having invoices in excess of 30-days past due or upon receipt of a
   chargeback. In such cases, VPBX will send a notification email to the
   Billing Administrator(s) of the account. VPBX may, at its sole
   discretion, reinstate the Service of Your account after receiving
   payment of the chargeback amount, a $25.00 chargeback fee, and any
   other amounts/fees due. VPBX reserves the right to require, at its sole
   discretion, a deposit in an amount up to the average of the past four
   billing cycles prior to reinstating any account.

   If You fail to pay any bill in full by the due date set forth on said
   bill, You will be liable for a late payment fee of $25.00 or for
   interest at the rate of 1.5% per month – whichever is higher, or a
   lower rate as required by state law. The interest rate may be
   compounded as permitted by state law. You authorize VPBX to refer Your
   account, if past due, to attorneys and/or collection agencies for
   further action. If any collection action is taken, You agree to
   reimburse VPBX for reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and any
   other costs and fees, including collection agency fees, undertaken to
   collect past due bills and/or any other fees. No provision of this
   Agreement shall require the payment or collection of interest in excess
   of the maximum permitted by applicable law. If any interest hereby
   provided for is adjudicated to be unlawful, the provisions of this
   section shall govern and neither You, nor sureties, guarantors,
   successors, or assigns by You shall be obligated to pay any amount of
   interest, or any other sum paid for the use, forbearance, or detention
   of money, in excess of the lawful amount. If VPBX receives, collects,
   or applies as interest any such sum, such amount as permitted by
   applicable law shall be applied as a payment and reduction of the
   amount due and owing to VPBX under this or any other agreement, and if
   said amount has been paid in full, any remaining excess money shall
   forthwith be returned to You. VPBX may assess an additional fee of
   twenty-five dollars ($25) for each check returned for nonpayment.

   You affirm and authorize any and all credit card charges related to
   Your accounts (identified by way of example from e-mail address, credit
   card or billing information) with a past due balance on an open,
   suspended or previous account be charged any outstanding balance upon
   opening a new account and/or updating credit card information on file.
   You further acknowledge VPBX has no obligation to provide You with any
   Services whatsoever until any and all outstanding balances related to
   any of Your past or current accounts have brought current.

   You may, at VPBX’s sole discretion, be deemed to be in default
   (“Default”) of this Agreement if: (a) You fail to pay the full amount
   billed to You under this Agreement, or any other agreement between You
   and VPBX, within three (3) business days after the due date; (b) You
   have in the past established a pattern, at VPBX’s sole discretion, of
   non-payment of amounts due VPBX or our affiliate(s); (c) You cancel
   Service prior to the end of the Term of this Agreement; (d) You breach
   any representation to us or fail to perform and/or adhere to any of the
   terms You have affirmed in this Agreement; (e) You are subject to any
   proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act or similar laws; (f) You engage in
   any activity that constitutes, at VPBX’s sole and absolute discretion,
   illegal or unauthorized use of Service or equipment; (g) You use the
   Service or equipment in such a manner that it interferes with or
   adversely affects VPBX’s ability to deliver Service to any other
   subscribers; (h) You have failed to respond to calls or email attempts
   to contact You about Your Account, or; (i) Your usage of Service is
   deemed by VPBX, at its sole discretion, to be excessive. If You are in
   Default, VPBX may, at VPBX’s sole discretion, with or without notice,
   suspend or restrict Your Service and/or terminate this Agreement, in
   addition to all other remedies available to VPBX. VPBX may require
   reactivation charges and deposits as set forth above, to restore
   Service after termination or suspension. Upon termination or
   suspension, You are responsible for paying all amounts and charges
   owing and/or damages determined under this Agreement, including any
   applicable cancellation fee(s). You agree to pay all costs including
   attorneys’ fees, collection costs and court costs VPBX may incur in
   enforcing this Agreement through any adjudication process.

   1.3.4 Term of Service and Requests for Modification

   The term of this Agreement begins on the date You or VPBX activates
   Your Service. Monthly-billed Service plans will automatically renew
   each month, whereas annually-billed Service plans will automatically
   renew every twelve (12) months for another twelve (12) month term.

   You acknowledge and approve modification request(s) from the following
   person(s) (“Approved Persons”): person(s) able to provide the Account
   name, unique account number, and the contact telephone number used by
   You under this Agreement and who is listed as a Billing Administrator
   in the VPBX vBilling portal for Your account.

   You and/or Approved Persons may request cancellation of this Agreement
   at any time by making such in writing or by email to [email protected]
   Accounts will be canceled by VPBX within a reasonable timeframe. You
   authorize VPBX to cancel Your account at, and by the request of,
   Approved Persons. The effect of cancellation shall be to relieve You of
   the obligation to pay new fees subsequent to the date in which
   cancellation becomes effective. You represent and warrant that You
   understand said account will no longer be able to utilize any of the
   Services enjoyed while the account was active. You further affirm that
   all current fees, including those accrued but not yet billed or
   invoiced, are still owed and will be paid upon receipt of final
   invoice.

   Account cancellation shall not impair or discharge any of Your
   obligations or liabilities for use of Services subsequent to the
   initial request of cancellation yet prior to the effective date of said
   cancellation. You shall not be entitled to any refund of any portion of
   the accrued charges for the month in which cancellation notice was
   received, up until the date that the cancellation becomes effective.

   Early cancellation of an annually paid account, during its first 12
   month period, will result in the billing of the number of months
   actually used in said period in which the account is canceled, with no
   proration inside of a billing month. Billing for said months will be at
   the standard, non-discounted, monthly rate for the type of rate plan in
   use, with a minimum of four (4) months billed within the first twelve
   (12) months of Service. If the plan being canceled is no longer offered
   at the time of cancellation, the amount billed will be based on the
   last price in place at the time said rate plan was available. A penalty
   charge of 20% of the initial annual payment amount will also be
   applied. All other charges, taxes, and fees other than those for Basic
   Service will still be due. Cancellation of an annual account at any
   time subsequent to its initial 12-month period are subject to a penalty
   charge of 100% of the remaining term of the contracted period.

   You and/or Approved Persons may request a change of Plan(s), which must
   be submitted in writing or by email to [email protected] You warrant
   You understand that requests for change may be approved or denied at
   the sole discretion of VPBX.

   You acknowledge that approved changes to Your Service may result in
   charges and administration fees, including any applicable early
   cancellation fee(s), should such fees apply to Your current Plan.
   Approved Change requests will take effect at the beginning of Your next
   billing cycle. You may request to have Your Plan converted mid-billing
   cycle for a one-time fee of $25 per conversion. Expedited conversions
   typically take 2-4 business days. Account fees for expedited
   conversions will not be prorated. You are limited to three (3) plan
   conversions during any twelve (12) month period. Additional conversions
   will be assessed $50 each. If You convert to a Plan having a term which
   is shorter than Your previous Plan, You may remain obligated for the
   full term of the original Plan.

   1.3.5 Marketing and other communications from VPBX

   From time to time VPBX may send promotional or other marketing-related
   communications to Your email address(s) on file. These communications
   are intended to be informative (e.g. VPBX has added a new function or
   service to our platform that we feel will enhance Your experience) or
   supportive of Your general use of the service. You can at any time
   choose to reduce or completely opt-out of these communications by
   selecting options available at the bottom of each email. You
   acknowledge that opting out of promotional or other marketing-related
   communications will not prevent You from receiving other email or phone
   communications from our support, billing or other departments for their
   business process-specific purposes.
    2. Product(s) and Pricing

   VPBX offers a variety of Services for You to choose from. These
   Services vary from Monthly to Annual and Metered, Flat-Rate/Unlimited
   to À la carte Services, and will change from time to time. You
   acknowledge and affirm that VPBX has no obligation to maintain, freeze,
   add, retain, enhance or customize features or Services for You. VPBX
   reserves the right, in its sole discretion, with or without notice to
   discontinue, modify, repackage, reprice, replace or otherwise alter any
   products, plans, features, functionality, reports or any other element
   of the Service (“Changes”). You acknowledge and affirm that You agree
   to hold harmless and release VPBX of any liability directly or
   indirectly related to any and all Changes made to the Service.

   2.1 Flat Rate/Unlimited Plans

   VPBX reserves the right to review usage of flat-rate plans to ensure
   that You are not abusing such plans. You agree to use the flat-rate
   plans for normal day-to-day typical business voice or fax calls and
   will not employ methods or devices to take advantage of flat-rate plans
   by using the Service(s) excessively or for means not intended by VPBX.
   Flat-rate services may not be used for monitoring services, data
   transmissions, transmission of broadcasts or transmission of recorded
   material. VPBX may terminate, with or without notice, Your Service or
   change Your Service plan if, in its sole discretion, VPBX determines
   You are abusing the flat-rate plan.

   All Flat-Rate Plans are subject to all of the Prohibited Use and Fair
   Use limitations set forth in this Fair Use Policy. In addition, all
   flat-rate plans are subject to the following terms and conditions:
     * Flat-Rate Plans are for normal residential or business use.
     * Flat-Rate Plans are intended to facilitate communication between
       two persons at one time per line.
     * Flat-Rate Plans cannot, under any circumstances, be used for
       call-in lines, call centers, trunking (to a PBX or otherwise),
       continuous or extensive call forwarding, autodialing, fax blasting,
       telemarketing (including without limitation charitable or political
       solicitation and/or polling), junk faxing, fax spamming, or other
       high volume or multi-person calling or faxing purposes.
     * Any other use forbidden by law.

   VirtualPBX offers unlimited monthly plans for some of its products and
   services. An unlimited plan is subject to the terms and restrictions of
   these ToS. If, for any reason, VirtualPBX believes that Your usage of
   the unlimited plan and services violates these ToS, then VirtualPBX
   may, in its sole discretion with or without notice, either terminate
   Your unlimited plan or immediately convert Your unlimited plan to a
   metered plan, as set forth in the ToS.

   2.2 Fax Services

   Internet-based fax services are built into many VPBX products. Both
   inbound faxes sent to Your Service on any VPBX number and outbound
   faxes from Your Service may use plan minutes and/or are subject to the
   fair use policies and the specifics of Your Plan.

   2.3 Free/Discounted Equipment or Services on Annual Plans

   On some plans with an annual payment, VPBX will make available free or
   heavily discounted Equipment at Your request. These discounts are
   provided with the understanding that You will stay with Virtual PBX for
   a minimum period of twelve (12) months. Should You receive free or
   specially discounted equipment as part of an eligible plan and then (a)
   cancel or cause to be terminated before the first twelve (12) month
   term is complete; or (b) within the initial twelve (12) month period
   change to a plan that does not offer or include free or discounted
   equipment, You agree and hereby authorize the charge of 100% of the
   price displayed on the VPBX website that is in place at the time of
   Service modification, for any and all free or discounted equipment
   (“Equipment Charge”). This Equipment Charge is not eligible for, nor
   will be, prorated.

   Should the particular equipment in Your possession no longer be
   available on the VPBX website, You agree and hereby authorize the
   charge of 75% of the most recent Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price,
   as last published by the Manufacturer, that is available at the time of
   Service modification, for any and all free or discounted equipment
   (“Discontinued Equipment Charge”). This Discontinued Equipment Charge
   is not eligible for, nor will be, prorated.

   2.4 Free Trials

   On some products, VPBX may offer trial accounts or trial periods. Free
   Trials are limited to one account and restricted to first-time
   customers/subscribers. International numbers and calls are not
   available for Free Trials, and other restrictions may apply. You must
   have Internet access and a valid Credit/Debit Card to participate in a
   free trial offer. Upon registering for a Free Trial, Your Credit/Debit
   Card will be authorized. No charges will be made against the
   Credit/Debit Card – aforementioned $1.00 hold notwithstanding – unless
   You do not cancel the account within the Free Trial period, typically,
   14 days. VPBX will convert the Free Trial account to a standard account
   and begin billing Your Credit/Debit Card automatically at the end of
   the free trial period. YOU MUST CANCEL YOUR FREE TRIAL ACCOUNT BEFORE
   THE END OF THE FREE TRIAL PERIOD TO AVOID CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT/DEBIT
   CARD. VPBX will continue to bill the Credit/Debit Card on a recurring
   monthly basis until the account is canceled. You may cancel Your
   account at any time subject to the terms and conditions of cancellation
   as described above. Once Your account is converted to a standard
   account, VPBX will not issue credits or refunds for any remaining
   unused trial minutes. You are responsible to ensure You are signing up
   for a Free Trial account. VPBX will not credit or refund any amount
   charged if You signed up for a standard account instead of a Free Trial
   account. Free Trial accounts are not available on all products.

   2.5 Discounts and Credits

   VPBX may offer from time to time promotional discounts, which You may
   or may not be eligible for depending on the terms and conditions of
   said promotional discount. You acknowledge that You may not qualify and
   agree to hold VPBX harmless for any promotional discounts for which You
   are not eligible.

   From time to time You may receive credits and/or discounts towards or
   on future invoices as the normal course of doing business, as the
   result of disputed charges that VPBX deems, in its sole discretion, to
   be valid, or other reasons as the need presents itself and VPBX
   approves of such credits and/or discounts. You agree to hold the
   details of any credits and/or discounts received in the strictest of
   confidence. You acknowledge any violation of this clause may result in
   the revocation of said credits and/or discounts in question regardless
   of how far in the past said credits and/or discounts were approved.
   Revocation of credits and/or discounts will result in the aggregated
   value of all credits and/or discounts from the time of their inception
   becoming immediately due and payable, and You authorize the immediate
   charge of revoked credits and/or discounts to Your payment method on
   file.

   2.6 Equipment Acquisition and Returns

   During the normal course of business, as a matter of convenience, or
   for any other reason, You may elect to acquire, whether by payment for
   goods sold or as part of a free or heavily discounted plan, equipment
   for use with Your Services from VPBX. VPBX does not lock down or
   restrict equipment sold to the VPBX Service. To this end, You
   acknowledge and affirm that, warranty exchanges notwithstanding, all
   equipment sales are final and not entitled to a refund or exchange.
   Free and/or heavily discounted equipment is subject to the terms and
   conditions outlined in section 2.3 above, in addition to the terms and
   conditions set forth in this section 2.6.

   2.6.1 Equipment Return Policy

   Warranty claims notwithstanding, VPBX may, in its sole discretion,
   agree to accept the return of equipment (“RMA”). The financial terms of
   the RMA are subject to the terms and conditions of the section 2.5
   above.

   You agree to be responsible for all return shipping charges and assume
   any and all liability for any damage that may occur while shipping
   equipment to VPBX. VPBX recommends You elect to purchase insurance for
   the full replacement value of the equipment being returned. All
   equipment returned as part of a non-warranty RMA transaction must be
   fully functional, RETURNED IN ORIGINAL PACKAGING, include all
   documentation, guides, ancillary equipment/parts and accessories,
   cables, peripherals, power supplies/adapters, and be in generally
   resalable condition. You agree and authorize, in the sole and absolute
   discretion of VPBX, either (a) the insured return of any equipment not
   in the aforementioned condition to You at Your expense; (b) a charge of
   twenty five (25) dollars for each item(s) missing, damaged or otherwise
   deemed, at the sole and absolute discretion of VPBX, to not be
   generally resalable, up to the full MSRP of the equipment being
   returned.

   You agree and affirm that You release any rights, possession or
   entitlement of any information contained on RMA equipment and said
   information becomes the property of VPBX upon its acceptance of the
   package from the carrier. VPBX recommends You properly manage and/or
   dispose of any residual information before releasing RMA equipment to a
   carrier for delivery to VPBX.

   States as well as use the Service as You travel abroad; however, the
   Service is intended to work within the United States and Canada where

   If the high-speed Internet connection You are using is not within a
   VPBX service area or Your ISP or broadband provider places restrictions
   on using VoIP services, VPBX does not claim that Your ISP will allow
   You to use the Service. You will be solely responsible for any
   violations of local laws and regulations or violations of Your ISP and
   broadband provider terms of service because of Your use of the Service.

    6. not to transmit through the Service any unlawful, harassing,
       libelous, abusive, threatening, harmful, vulgar, obscene or
       otherwise objectionable material of any kind or nature. You further
       agree not to transmit any material that encourages conduct that
       could constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability
       or otherwise violate any applicable local, state, national or

   access to other computer systems. You shall not interfere with another
   subscribers use and enjoyment of the Service or another entity’s use

   3.10 Number Ownership and Porting

   You understand and agree that You are not the owner of any
   VPBX-assigned telephone number (Number). All rights to, and ownership
   of, any such Number are retained by, and fully vested in, VPBX. VPBX
   will assign or re-assign such Numbers to You for Your use during the
   term of this Agreement. You agree and affirm that (a) VPBX may from
   time to time and for various reasons need to change the Number assigned
   to You (by way of example, area code splits or for any other reason
   within or outside of VPBX’s control) and (b) following the termination
   of Your account for any reason You will no longer have access to said
   Number(s). You acknowledge and affirm an understanding that said
   Number(s) may be immediately re-assigned to another subscriber. You
   further agree that VPBX will not be liable for damages (including
   consequential or special damages) arising out of any such Number
   re-assignment and You hereby waive any claims with respect to any such
   re-assignment, whether based on contract, tort or other grounds, even
   if VPBX has been advised of the possibility of damages.

   From time to time You may port numbers into Your System, or port
   Numbers out of Your System.

   YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AFFIRM THAT SHOULD YOU CANCEL YOUR VPBX SERVICE
   PRIOR TO NUMBER(S) SUCCESSFULLY BEING ACCEPTED BY THE WINNING CARRIER,
   YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO PORT NUMBER(S) AWAY FROM YOUR SYSTEM, AND LOSE
   ANY RIGHTS TO SAID NUMBERS.

   You acknowledge and affirm that Numbers on accounts suspended or
   terminated for any reason are not eligible for porting out, regardless
   whether You ported said numbers into Your System.

   You acknowledge and affirm that Numbers on accounts having a past due
   or outstanding balance are not eligible for porting out, regardless
   whether You ported said numbers into Your System.

   In the event that the Service associated with Your VPBX Number is in
   the process of being canceled, then VPBX will, upon Your written
   request and following standard porting procedures, allow You to move
   Your VPBX Number(s) from VPBX to an alternate carrier provided that (a)
   the cancellation of Service is on favorable terms; that (b) all fees
   and charges for the Service, whether or not then due, have been paid in
   full.

   The timing of the port completion is determined by the winning carrier.
   VPBX is not notified by the winning carrier when the port is complete.
   Therefore it is Your responsibility to communicate with VPBX when the
   number has been ported away and is fully functional on the winning
   carrier’s service. VPBX will then remove the number from the Your
   system.

   PORTING AWAY THE LAST NUMBER ON YOUR SERVICE WILL NOT AUTOMATICALLY
   CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT. It is Your responsibility to communicate with VPBX
   when the last Number has been ported away and is fully functional on
   the winning carrier’s service. At that point, Approved Persons may
   request cancellation of this Agreement by making such request online,
   in writing or by email to [email protected].

   3.11 Recording of Calls

   Your System includes functionality to facilitate Your recording calls.
   While the System provides a mechanism for automatically notifying
   parties when inbound calls are being recorded, no such recording
   ability is available for outbound calls. Regardless of whether calls
   being recorded are inbound or outbound, You agree and affirm that You
   and Your users are responsible for obeying all state, local, and
   federal laws associated with the announcement and/or use of call
   recording. VPBX accepts no responsibility for the use, or Your misuse
   of, call recording or the announcement of its use.
    4. Notices

   Notices to You shall be deemed effective when sent by email to the
   Billing Administrator and/or the System Administrator of record, or, at
   our option, three (3) days following the date deposited in the US Mail
   addressed to Your address as kept in our files. You are responsible for
   notifying us of any changes in Your address and contact information
   such as email address and phone number. Written notice to us shall be
   effective when directed to our Billing Department and received at our
   email address, [email protected] Your notice must specify Your name,
   VPBX phone number, and Your account number and must be sent from the
   Billing Administrator’s email for the account in question. Oral notices
   shall be deemed effective on the date reflected in our records.
    5. Modification, Transfer and Assignment

   VPBX may change or modify this Agreement from time to time; however,
   any such change will (a) be made in good faith, and (b) if significant
   (as determined in the sole discretion of VPBX), will only be made after
   first providing You with notice of the change. You can review the most
   current version of this Agreement at any time at
   virtualpbx.com/agreement. If You do not agree to a significant change,
   You may request cancellation of this Agreement by giving VPBX written
   notice within 15 days of receipt of the notice of such significant
   change. No hand-marked changes on this Agreement or any amendment will
   be valid unless accepted by VPBX in writing. Delivery by facsimile
   transmission (fax) or email to the appropriate party of a copy of a
   modification of this Agreement shall be effective as delivery of an
   original.

   VPBX may assign all or part of its rights or duties under this
   Agreement in connection with a sale of all, or substantially all, the
   assets of VPBX to a third party without notice to you; provided, any
   such third party shall be obliged to honor the terms of this Agreement.

   You may not assign this Agreement without prior written consent from
   VPBX.

   obligations impossible.
    8. Mutual Respect and Privacy of Communications

   You agree that the business relationship between You and VPBX provides
   value to both parties and as such enjoys a mutual and reciprocal
   respect. To this end, You agree that You will privately approach VPBX
   with any grievances or frustrations related to the Service You may be
   experiencing. By extension, You agree to not directly, indirectly,
   through a third party or any other vector, publicly make or cause any

   abused, or harassed any of its employees, contractors, agents, or other
   representatives; (b) You cause or bring any legal action or proceeding,
   including without limitation in any court, regulatory, or
   administrative body, arbitral body, or mediator, against VPBX, or
   participate in any class action lawsuit in which VPBX is a party; (c)
   it should be, in VPBX’s sole and absolute discretion, in the best
   interest of VPBX to do so.

   You may cancel Your account at any time, with or without cause subject
   to the terms and conditions outlined herein as well as those specified
   in Your plan.
   10. Limitation of Liability

   VPBX shall not be liable to You for interruptions of service, loss of
   data, interception of any Your telephone calls or faxes, omissions or
   errors of third parties, equipment failures, natural disasters,
   strikes, government actions, or other causes. VPBX shall not be liable
   if changes in operations, procedures, or services require modification
   or alteration of Your equipment or render Your equipment obsolete.
   There shall be no reductions, set-offs, or credits against the charges
   for service for downtime or interruption of service. In no event shall
   VPBX be liable to You for incidental, consequential, or punitive
   damages, including but not limited to lost profits, loss of use, or
   loss of business opportunity even if VPBX has been advised of the
   possibility of such damages. VPBX shall not be liable for injury to
   You, other persons, or property damage through the use of any equipment
   or service provided under this Agreement. In no event shall VPBX be
   liable for losses, damages, or claims arising out of Your use or
   attempted use of 911 or E911 service(s), nor shall VPBX be liable for
   Your inability to access the 911 or E911 service. This limitation of
   liability applies to all causes of action and survives termination of
   this Agreement.
   11. Indemnity

   YOU AGREE TO DEFEND, INDEMNIFY, AND HOLD HARMLESS VPBX AND ITS PARENTS,
   SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, AND ANY
   UNDERLYING CARRIER, FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, EXPENSES OR
   DAMAGES (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES), WHETHER KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, ARISING
   FROM (a) YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, (b) ANY OTHER PERSON’S USE OF ANY
   ACCOUNT OR PIN YOU MAINTAIN, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH USE IS
   AUTHORIZED BY YOU, OR (c) YOUR PROMISES OR STATEMENTS MADE IN THIS
   AGREEMENT. YOU HEREBY AGREE TO WAIVE ALL LAWS THAT MAY LIMIT THE
   EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FOREGOING RELEASES. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING,
   YOU SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR CLAIMS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING FROM
   THE INTENTIONAL OR GROSSLY NEGLIGENT ACTS OF VPBX OR ITS EMPLOYEES,
   AGENTS, CONTRACTORS, OR REPRESENTATIVES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
   SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AND SHALL SURVIVE
   TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.

   You agree to reimburse VPBX for any and all costs and reasonable
   attorneys’ fees incurred by VPBX in defending any claims relating to
   Your misuse of service or equipment. You also agree to indemnify, hold
   harmless, and defend VPBX against any claims relating to the service
   brought by Your callers arising from interruption of service, loss of
   data, interception of any of Your telephone calls or faxes, omission or
   errors of third parties, equipment failures, natural disasters,
   strikes, government actions, or other causes beyond VPBX’s reasonable
   control.
   12. Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration

   In the event of any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising
   from or relating to this Agreement or the breach thereof, the parties
   hereto shall use their best efforts to settle the dispute, claim,
   question, or disagreement. To this effect, they shall consult and
   negotiate with each other in good faith and, recognizing their mutual
   interests, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution satisfactory
   to both parties. If they do not reach such solution within a period of
   45 days from initial communication of dispute, claim, question, or
   disagreement, then, upon written notice by either party to the other,
   all disputes, claims, questions, or differences shall be finally
   settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration
   Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial
   Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related
   Disputes, as modified by this Agreement, and judgment on the award
   rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having
   jurisdiction thereof.

   Both parties agree that, by entering into this Agreement, You and VPBX
   are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a
   class action. This Agreement to arbitrate is intended to apply to any
   and all causes of action and includes, but is not limited to:
     * any claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the
       relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute,
       fraud, misrepresentation or any other cause of action;
     * any claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement;
     * any claims that are currently the subject of purported class action
       litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and
     * any claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.

   This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus
   the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement
   of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination
   of this Agreement.

   An arbitrator selected by VPBX and an arbitrator selected by You shall,
   within 10 days of their appointment, select a third neutral arbitrator.
   In the event that they are unable to do so, the parties or their
   attorneys may request the American Arbitration Association to appoint
   the third neutral arbitrator. Prior to the commencement of hearings,
   each of the arbitrators appointed shall provide an oath or undertaking
   of impartiality. The award of the arbitrators shall be accompanied by a
   written statement of the reasons upon which the award is based. The
   arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. Any arbitration
   under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis;
   consolidation, class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.
   All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except those issues
   relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision,
   which is for a court to decide.

   Unless You and VPBX agree in writing to the contrary, any arbitration
   hearings will take place in Santa Clara County, California. If Your
   claim is for $10,000 or less, You may choose, at Your initial sole
   cost, whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of
   documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or
   by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If Your claim
   exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA
   Rules.

   In the event of any legal action, arbitration or other, between You and
   VPBX, the non-prevailing party shall reimburse the prevailing party for
   all reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses
   relating to the Dispute.
   13. Regulation, Governing Law and Severability

   The provision of Service under this Agreement may be regulated by
   federal, state, or local authority where the Service is provided. VPBX
   reserves the right to make changes to this Agreement and to the
   provision of Service under this Agreement that are necessary to comply
   with statutes, rules or regulations governing the provision of the
   Service.

   THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., EXCLUDING ITS
   CONFLICTS-OF-LAW RULES, GOVERN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH
   LAW IS PREEMPTED BY OR INCONSISTENT WITH APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAW, AND
   YOUR USE OF THE VPBX SERVICES. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT THE EXCLUSIVE
   JURISDICTION FOR ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE ARISING FROM THE PAST, CURRENT,
   OR OTHER USE OF THE VPBX SERVICES RESIDES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,
   COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA, U.S.A. AND YOU CONSENT TO PERSONAL JURISDICTION
   IN SUCH LOCALES WITH RESPECT TO ALL SUCH CLAIMS OR DISPUTES, WHETHER
   YOU ARE A CURRENT, PAST, OR RETURNING SUBSCRIBER. THIS JURISDICTIONAL
   CLAUSE SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AND SHALL
   SURVIVE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.

   In the event that any action is filed to interpret or enforce this
   Agreement, the most prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its
   costs, including expert witness fees and reasonable attorneys’ fees. If
   any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that
   portion shall be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent, and
   the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect. This
   Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between VPBX and You with
   respect to Your use of VPBX services and Your VPBX account, and it
   supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposal(s),
   whether oral or written, between VPBX and You with respect thereto. The
   failure of VPBX to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this
   Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

Memorial Day and Military Programs

   Memorial Day Memorial Day This Memorial Day weekend you’ll hopefully be
   out camping, picnicking, road tripping, or just hanging around with
   your friends and family. One thing that we hope is involved no matter
   what you have in store, however, is a recognition of the men and women
   who have paid the ultimate sacrifice and their families so that we
   could all enjoy the freedom to do whatever we please this long weekend.

Success on the Battlefield, and in the Boardroom

   There has been a rising tide of desirability for having veterans on
   staff as their many leadership and objectives-based qualities are just
   what corporate America looks for in ideal candidates. Furthermore, many
   veterans are taking their innate skills and focusing on building their
   own companies backed by the increasing number of entrepreneurial
   lending options catered just to veterans.

Our Turn to Serve

   For years, VirtualPBX has been committed to supporting our nation’s
   service men and women as they reenter into civilian life. Fueled by the
   new influx of capital provided by veteran-focused investment, many of
   whom are bound to continue accomplishing new missions in business.
   Having trudged challenging roads enough already, we want to make their
   pathway to success in business as smooth as possible from here. That’s
   why we offer and will maintain evergreen, special military pricing
   incentives on our award-winning VirtualPBX business telephone service
   for current and former servicemen and women.

Moving Forward

   We know that what we have to offer pales in comparison to that which
   has been given to us so freely by our nation’s veterans. We also know
   that, while every customer benefits from our industry-leading support,
   we take unique care and pride in each and every one of our veterans
   that we have the honor to serve.

   Thank you to all of our veterans, their families, and all active men
   and women in the Armed Forces. We hope you all get a moment of rest
   this weekend as we honor you and your sacrifices. If we can help you in
   any way or if you have any questions about the special military
   pricing, please do not hesitate to contact one of our expert support
   representatives today.

Record Phone Calls to Broker Better Business Deals

   Posted on September 25, 2018   by Rachel Anderson

   Record Phone Calls Record Phone Calls Whether you’re involved in a
   family-owned shop or a multi-national corporation, the communications
   your business has with its customers and partners can prove extremely
   important to your success. Some businesses have begun to record phone
   calls to aid recall of their conversations, and you might want to
   consider following their lead.

   According to recent analysis at Software Advice, call centers involved
   with call recording showed a strong preference for web-based software
   like our Dash Business Phone Plans. The call centers emphasized their
   desire for features like call recording and conferencing, but you don’t
   have to run a call center to take advantage of those same features. You
   can reap the benefits of cloud-based software regardless of what style
   operation you run.

   Let’s examine a few ways that call recording can make a positive impact
   on your business relations.

Keep it Personal

   No business could function well without solid performances from its
   individual employees.

   Take journalism, for example, where reporters are charged with
   interviewing all manner of people to piece together stories. Both facts
   and personal quotations come from one-on-one interviews between
   reporters and community members. Sometimes interviews take place over
   the phone, and in those cases, the conversations could be recorded for
   better recall.

   Although journalists may strive to keep their facts straight and their
   quotes accurate, even their best efforts won’t always create 100
   percent accuracy on the printed page. They could improve the accuracy
   of their stories by simply allowing a cloud-based system to record
   their phone calls.

   In most cases, replay of a call is as simple as accessing the online
   system – like signing in to our Call Recording Manager to play or
   download an important conversation. This makes it easy to fact-check
   notes scrawled on a notepad or quotes hastily typed. From there, the
   newspaper benefits by printing highly accurate pieces, and the public
   benefits from a strong display of community events.

For the Good of the Company

   Stepping up the ladder of responsibility, it may also be necessary for
   a multinational CEO to record phone calls for an event as pivotal as a
   merger.

   Say a deal between your company and your biggest competitor was set to
   merge your operations. That may happen once in your lifetime. But it
   won’t proceed without a sign-off from your board of directors.

   Unlike the one-on-one between a journalist and town resident, a
   conversation between CEO and shareholders is a group event. This means
   that, as CEO, you would be responsible for recall of a deal subject to
   the opinion of perhaps dozens of other people.

   Recording your conference with the board would leave nothing to chance.
   Changes to the agreement would be captured. A final vote would be
   etched silicon. In any case, a weighty recording such as this could not
   only approve a huge business deal, it could serve as legal backing for
   the deal as it moves forward.

Analyze an Ongoing Deal

   What if you aren’t yet successful with your personal interview or
   business merger? Sometimes a sure thing doesn’t always proceed as you
   desire.

   Inc’s analysis of deals gone wrong ask the hypotheticals “What could I
   have done better?” and “How could I have handled the situation better?”
   A call recorder can help illuminate the problems that caused the floor
   to fall from under you.

   Don’t let every missed opportunity ruin your future attempts at
   negotiation. Instead, learn from the bad deals by playing back the
   conversations that led to the unsavory outcome. When you learn about
   what you did well, what went wrong, and why, you can do better in
   future interactions and secure the next big deal that comes your way.

Record Phone Calls for Perspective

   When you record phone calls, you give yourself an outside perspective
   on situations you helped create. You look at your own actions from the
   outside in a way that wouldn’t be possible otherwise.

   No matter the scope of your conversations, there’s always something you
   can learn from an unedited replay of your interactions with another
   individual or group. Why not give it a try?

The Most Important Call Center Metrics to Track

   Posted on August 28, 2018   by Rachel Anderson

   Call Center Metrics Call Center Metrics ICMI (International Customer
   Management Institute) has named the following as the most important
   call center metrics to track – first call resolution, service level
   response time, adherence to schedule, forecasting accuracy,
   self-service accessibility, contact quality, and customer satisfaction.
   We can’t agree enough that these points are crucial for the success of
   any call center – whether it be a sales organization, customer support,
   a political campaign, fundraising effort, or any other type of call
   center. But exactly how can these metrics be tracked effectively?

Tracking Call Responses

   Whether inbound, outbound, or a combination of the two, not every call
   ends with a successful transaction. In fact, especially for a
   cold-calling sales organization, it’s not uncommon for the majority of
   calls to result in a refusal to purchase/signup. For this reason, it is
   important for agents to be efficient with their time. When an agent has
   to call a lead back repeatedly because they were not equipped to answer
   their questions, a call lasts longer than it should, or the lead is
   left waiting, sales could be slipping through the cracks. Many of these
   inefficiencies can be prevented in the training process, but there are
   a few key call center metrics to watch for.
    1. An abundance of missed calls and voicemails: These should be
       considered as potential missed opportunities and avoided at all
       costs. One easy fix is an overflow queue staffed by managers or
       members of other teams capable of answering questions and
       facilitating transactions when a primary staff is overwhelmed.
    2. Call outcomes: The result of a call should be tied to the lead’s
       contact information. Most often this is done with the assistance of
       a CRM Integration which can be customized to track the call
       outcomes possible with your efforts, how many calls occurred
       between a single contact, and how much revenue was tied to that
       particular transaction.
    3. Trends in call activity logs: Advanced phone systems will provide
       detailed call logs with a whole host of call center metrics to
       analyze like call duration, time of day, and who the caller spoke
       with. Trends found can help you address which agents are adhering
       to call volume goals, whether staffing matches your needs, and
       more.

   Call Center Telephone Options: Yealink SIP-T46G Call Center Telephone
   Options: Yealink SIP-T46G Are you planning to set up a call center or
   perhaps work with one? Are you trying to equip your sales and support
   team with the best phone systems available, the kind most popular in
   call centers? Call centers and businesses alike depend not only the
   agents and managers making phone calls – although these individuals
   indeed are a huge part of a successful one. The technologies employed
   by call centers and business play a pivotal role – including the call
   center telephone, call routing software, and reporting mechanisms.

   A call center telephone system facilitates basic functions, such as
   call routing, multi-channel communications, individual agent
   preferences, and call activity reports. Integrations with services like
   customer relationship management (CRM) software and custom integrations
   made possible by Webhooks are also growing in popularity as they
   provide deeper insights into your contacts by connecting call data to
   additional data points. Added features such as Real-Time Monitoring,
   automated customer surveys, and multilingual customer service add
   significant value as well.

Which Call Center Telephone Options to Choose

   Choosing the right call center telephone to supply your workers with
   may seem like a daunting task, but fortunately with a hosted PBX
   service, you have a wealth of options built to fit a range of budgets
   and preferences.
    1. Buy new VoIP phones: for companies and call centers looking to
       build a long-term operation with in-house staff, preprogramed VoIP
       phones provide a high tech solution that can handle multiple calls
       per phone. Two of the most popular models in our inventory include
       the Polycom VVX 301 VoIP Phone and the Yealink SIP T46G which comes
       with a full color touch screen.
    2. Use existing desk phones: switching your business phone service
       doesn’t necessarily mean switching the phones that you use.
       VirtualPBX supports most phones from Ubiquity, Polycom, Yealink,
       and Cisco, but if there is a phone or phones that you would like to
       use with your service and are unsure of their compatibility, just
       give us a call! Our agents are standing by 24/7 to answer your
       compatibility questions at 888.825.0800.
    3. Buy new mobile phones or request SIM cards for 4G LTE service: for
       mobile call centers or for those who require data and texting on
       top of typical phone service, 4G LTE Mobile is the all in one
       solution. No need to pay multiple providers, handle expense
       reports, or worry about employees using personal contact details.
    4. Check out our free to use Web Phone: take advantage of our
       browser-based Web Phone to make calls using plan minutes. No
       downloads or updates to manage and no user fees make this the easy
       low-cost solution without sacrificing call quality. What’s more, it
       improves collaboration, members of the team can work remotely, and
       managers remain connected while they are away from the office.

   No matter the call center telephone or telephones that you choose, all
   options are backed by 24/7 customer support from VirtualPBX. Better
   yet, just like your phone system, the devices you choose are up to you.
   Use any mix of VoIP desk phones, mobile phones, or Web Phones to make
   and receive calls and make changes at any time. So, what will you
   choose? Let us know which device option fits your needs best by

What Drives Success in Call Center Management?

   Posted on August 16, 2018   by Rachel Anderson

   Call Center Management Call Center Management A call center is a
   workforce that manages inbound and/or outbound call traffic to support
   a particular goal. The types of call centers vary, but some of the most
   common include political campaigns, lead generation, telemarketing,
   fundraising drives, grassroots campaigns and market research. While the
   intent of these efforts ranges greatly, there are a few guiding
   principles in call center management that can ensure success.

Call Center Management

   A successful call center depends on the alignment of all individuals
   involved – from top-level leadership to the newest trainee. Here are
   some essential tips for call center management:
    1. Staff your call center with committed individuals: A call center is
       a team effort and every member of the team must contribute to
       shared goals. When hiring, make sure to look for individuals who
       are aligned with these goals from the beginning and motivated to
       achieve them.
    2. Stay informed: Whether selling a product, a candidate, or a cause –
       it’s important to stay up to date on related news. This may include
       competitive analysis, news briefings, product training, or other
       research. The important thing to remember is that when your agents
       are on the line with someone, they’re representing the organization
       in every answer they provide. By anticipating and preparing for the
       questions that they will receive, you ensure that they’re
       presenting the image you want to project.
    3. Use technology to your advantage: A successful call center is
       productive. Depending on the needs and budget of your call center,
       you may consider a few different methods to make the calls
       themselves. VoIP desk phones, 4G LTE mobile phones, or even a free
       to use Web Phone will provide crystal clear audio. For smaller
       budgets that still prefer a physical phone, rental VoIP phones are
       a great option that allows you to return devices when you no longer
       need them.
    4. Track your efforts: Learn from your efforts by tracking the outcome
       of each call. The sophistication of this process will certainly
       depend on budget, but the best way to accurately track contacts and
       use data for reporting measures is through the use of a CRM. A CRM
       integration with your phone system will track call outcome, agent
       activity, call volume by date, and other call center management
       statistics.

VirtualPBX Robust Call Center Solutions

   Support your call center with technology that will boost productivity,
   provide insight into your efforts, and present a professional image.

Grassroots Campaigns

   Posted on August 10, 2018   by Rachel Anderson

   Grassroots Campaigns Grassroots Campaigns Grassroots campaigns are the
   best way to build communities united around a cause. A strong
   grassroots advocacy model raises awareness for a community of people
   around issues at local, state or federal levels. Grassroots campaigns
   will also typically include some degree of political activity in order
   to draw attention to causes and issues and to influence public
   perception, regulations, or public policy. It is typical for membership
   organizations such as Chambers of Commerce, professional trade
   associations, and all shades of advocacy groups to take advocacy to a
   level beyond the grassroots into more organized forms. The strength in
   networks of motivated membership organizations is often manifested in
   their clout and in their ability to organize with client organizations
   and to create united groups of concerned constituents which are hard to
   ignore.

Mechanics of Effective Grassroots Advocacy

   The best practices for effective grassroots advocacy include attracting
   volunteer participation, providing suitable and necessary information
   about public policy issues, and setting clear goals. The following
   considerations are simple steps you can make with your organization for
   it to be as successful as a strong grassroots advocacy organization.
     * Plan for success: as a grassroots advocacy entity you must have an
       organized advocacy agenda that uses a variety of grassroots
       techniques to make your voice heard around the issues you care
       about.
     * Organize around a strong leadership structure: to succeed at a very
       high level, have in place a stable leadership structure with
       clearly defined responsibilities.
     * Build a “brand” advocacy model: a well-articulated “brand” should
       give your advocacy materials a consistent look and feel just like
       any standard political campaign.
     * Use every available advocacy tool: to get your message out, be
       prepared to use every advocacy tool at your disposal, compare tools
       with other grassroots campaigns, and report on success metrics.
     * Grow your organization: a well-defined and sustained membership
       drive is a necessary strategy for strength in numbers.

Keep Your Grassroots Campaign Connected with Dash Business Phone Plans

   Communication is key in any grassroots campaign. Members should have a
   clear way to communicate with each other as well as a professional
   method to conduct outreach. Dash Business Phone Plans are the best fit.
   Not only are plans built for sharing across geographically dispersed
   teams – they are also made to fit any budget, allowing individuals the
   choice between sleek VoIP desk phones, 4G LTE mobile phones, or even a
   free to use Web Phone. For temporary grassroots campaigns, VirtualPBX
   also offers rental VoIP phones at a low per month rate.

   But of course it doesn’t stop at devices. Features like Call Recording,
   Salesforce CRM Integration, and Real-Time Monitor (shown below) allow
   you to measure success at every step of the way. Choose the plan that
   fits your grassroots campaign best or we can also create a bespoke
   solution for your campaign through our Custom Voice Solutions.
