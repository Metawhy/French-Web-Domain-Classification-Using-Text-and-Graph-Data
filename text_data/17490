kynaya-deactivated20150904 asked: So I'm curious. Is the wearer going to be
able to see at all of of the red xiii suit? Totally in love with it by the
way. Amazing work

   Yes, we are designing the suit so the wearer can see in it. Thanks for
   your question!

   hensocks and rooster-king are working on a new commission of everyone’s
   favorite canine/feline companion, Red XIII !!
   Here’s a little WIP pic of our foam body progress so far. We think this
   captures Red’s curvy shape well, while still translating it into a
   bipedal form.. but it’s not done yet! Stay tuned to see our progress!

Mega Charizards X & Y: FULL BUILD

   hensocks:

     Photo by: Somatic-Studios

     A month before Anime Expo 2015 we decided to make Pokemon costumes!
     Specifically Charizard’s Mega evolutions, X and Y. We used a hollow
     foam body technique because we wanted the costumes to really convey
     creature proportions yet stay as light as possible. We first started
     out with looking at a bunch of Charizard concept art, screenshots,
     etc. and began mapping out how to put a person somewhere in there.

spookystitch asked: The seaming on the fleece on your Charizards is so clean,
they're really stunning! I saw that you draped duct tape patterns for it, but
I was wondering if it was partially machine, partially hand sewn or all hand
done? Also, did you use anything to adhere the fleece to the foam to prevent
shifting/bubbling, or has that not been an issue for you?

   It’s all hand sewn!! We didn’t have a problem with the fleece bubbling,
   but we made sure to make the pattern slightly smaller so it could
   stretch over the foam tightly. Hope that helped!

RWBY - Gambol Shroud: FULL BUILD

   hensocks:

     done

     I got a great prop commission from CanonCosplay to make the Gambol
     Shroud from the show RWBY! I wanted to keep the build relatively
     lightweight but also durable enough for conventions, so I opted to
     work with PVC and Styrene sheets which was a new experience for me
     before. I learned a lot about the materials as I worked and grew to
     love them!
