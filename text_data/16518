Current Stable Version

   The current stable release of GIMP is 2.10.12 (2019-06-12).

   We think your OS is Well, we don't actually know. Either JavaScript is
   disabled, or I am not working quite right... So I am showing you all
   the options.

GIMP for Unix-like systems

   If available, the official package from your Unix-like distribution is
   the recommended method of installing GIMP!

   The flatpak build is new and has known limitations, though it will
   likely provide faster updates, following GIMP releases closely.
   Therefore choose your installation medium according to your needs.

   Install GIMP flatpak

   Flatpak build available in: i386, x86-64, ARM and AArch64.

Flatpak additional instructions

   The flatpak link above should open your software installer and prompt
   you to install GIMP. Yet it may not work out-of-the-box on some
   platforms since the flatpak technology is new. If that is the case,
   ensure flatpak is installed and if clicking the link still does not
   prompt to install GIMP, then manually install by command line:

   flatpak install
   https://flathub.org/repo/appstream/org.gimp.GIMP.flatpakref

   Once installed, it will be made available exactly the same way as other
   applications (menus, desktop overview, or any specific application
   launch process used by your desktop).
   If this is not the case, we suggest to report a bug to your desktop or
   distribution asking for proper support of flatpak. In the meantime, you
   can still run it by command line (not as the recommended method, only a
   workaround):

   flatpak run org.gimp.GIMP//stable

   This installation will also provide regular update. You don't have to
   come back on this page and install again (it will not work!) when a new
   version of GIMP is released. Instead if your distribution and/or
   desktop has a good support for flatpak, it should propose to perform
   updates.
   Once again, if your distribution does not have proper support, you can
   always fall back to using the following command line:

   flatpak update

Systems without flatpak support

   GIMP can also run on Solaris and is available for the BSD family of
   systems such as FreeBSD and OpenBSD.

   Please refer to the documentation for your Unix-like system on the
   installation of software.

GIMP for macOS

   Download GIMP 2.10.12
   via BitTorrent Download GIMP 2.10.12
   directly

   The download links above will attempt to download GIMP from one of our
   trusted mirror servers. If the mirrors do not work or you would rather
   download directly from our server, you can get the direct download
   here.

   Supported OS: macOS 10.9 Mavericks or over

   Since the 2.8.2 version, GIMP runs on OSX natively. No X11 environment
   is required.

Native build

   The official GIMP 2.10 DMG installer (linked above) is a stock GIMP
   build without any add-ons. Just open the downloaded DMG and drag and
   drop GIMP into your "Applications" folder.

   The SHA256 hash sum for gimp-2.10.12-x86_64.dmg is:
   8b964ad3dbbe31d0fa48fb834aa4c17fc0eb81becbc4595a57b04e3d4fc6efeb

Older Downloads

   Previous installers for OSX can be found here: download.gimp.org.

Macports

   An easy way to compile and install GIMP and other great Free software
   on your Mac is by using Macports. The installer allows you to choose
   from a large directory of packages. To install gimp using Macports, you
   simply do sudo port install gimp once you have Macports installed.

   Last we checked, the GIMP port file pointed to the current stable
   release and we have reports from people who've built GIMP successfully
   this way.
     * Download Macports

Homebrew

   Homebrew is similar to Macports and provides packages (aka formulas) to
   install, either by compiling them from source or by using pre-made
   binaries. There are indications that there is now a formula for GIMP,
   installable with: brew tap caskroom/cask && brew cask install gimp.
     * Download Homebrew

   NOTE! Please be aware that it was announced recently that Homebrew is
   using analytics. To turn this off in homebrew then run: brew analytics
   off
   You can read more about this on Brew Analytics.

Fink

   Fink is a package repository that offer mostly precompiled binaries. It
   provides the apt-get command known to e.g. Debian and Ubuntu users, and
   installing GIMP is as easy as sudo apt-get install gimp once you have
   installed the Fink installer.
   If there's no binary package, then fink install gimp will compile GIMP
   from source.

   Disclaimer: we haven't been able to determine if it is possible to
   install or build recent GIMP from Fink. Last we checked, GIMP 2.6.12
   appears to be the most recent GIMP package that is offered there.
     * Download Fink

GIMP for Windows

   Download GIMP 2.10.12
   via BitTorrent Download GIMP 2.10.12
   directly

   The download links above will attempt to download GIMP from one of our
   trusted mirror servers. If the mirrors do not work or you would rather
   download directly from our server, you can get the direct download
   here.

   Supported OS: Windows 7 or over

   These links download the official GIMP installer for Windows (~200 MB).
   The installer contains both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of GIMP, and
   will automatically use the appropriate one.

   BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file sharing system. It works by
   downloading GIMP from a distributed network of BitTorrent users, and
   may improve download speed dramatically. Choosing this option will
   download the torrent file for the GIMP installer. You may need to
   install a torrent client to make use of this file. Learn more...

GIMP User Manual

   These links download language-specific Windows installers for GIMP's
   local help. By default, they will place the help files with your GIMP
   installation.

   Note: GIMP uses online help by default. If you want to use this local
   help offline, you will need to change GIMP's help settings.
    1. In GIMP, select [Edit] > [Preferences] > [Help System]
    2. For "User manual", select "Use a locally installed copy"
    3. Under "Help Browser", you can choose between your system's web
       browser and GIMP's help browser plugin (if available).

   We now have a separate page for development versions of GIMP.

   Get it on our development downloads page.

FTP and Web Mirrors

   We had a server move a while back that caused us to lose our existing
   mirrors (moved from physical to virtual server and to an environment
   that doesn't allow FTP access). On the plus side, we are now able to
   offer rsync access to download.gimp.org.

Current Stable Version

   The current stable release of GIMP is 2.10.12 (2019-06-12).

   We think your OS is Well, we don't actually know. Either JavaScript is
   disabled, or I am not working quite right... So I am showing you all
   the options.

   Show downloads for GNU/Linux | OS X | Microsoft Windows | All

GIMP for Unix-like systems

   If available, the official package from your Unix-like distribution is
   the recommended method of installing GIMP!

   The flatpak build is new and has known limitations, though it will
   likely provide faster updates, following GIMP releases closely.
   Therefore choose your installation medium according to your needs.

   Install GIMP flatpak

   Flatpak build available in: i386, x86-64, ARM and AArch64.

Flatpak additional instructions

   The flatpak link above should open your software installer and prompt
   you to install GIMP. Yet it may not work out-of-the-box on some
   platforms since the flatpak technology is new. If that is the case,
   ensure flatpak is installed and if clicking the link still does not
   prompt to install GIMP, then manually install by command line:

   flatpak install
   https://flathub.org/repo/appstream/org.gimp.GIMP.flatpakref

   Once installed, it will be made available exactly the same way as other
   applications (menus, desktop overview, or any specific application
   launch process used by your desktop).
   If this is not the case, we suggest to report a bug to your desktop or
   distribution asking for proper support of flatpak. In the meantime, you
   can still run it by command line (not as the recommended method, only a
   workaround):

   flatpak run org.gimp.GIMP//stable

   This installation will also provide regular update. You don't have to
   come back on this page and install again (it will not work!) when a new
   version of GIMP is released. Instead if your distribution and/or
   desktop has a good support for flatpak, it should propose to perform
   updates.
   Once again, if your distribution does not have proper support, you can
   always fall back to using the following command line:

   flatpak update

Systems without flatpak support

   GIMP can also run on Solaris and is available for the BSD family of
   systems such as FreeBSD and OpenBSD.

   Please refer to the documentation for your Unix-like system on the
   installation of software.

   Since the 2.8.2 version, GIMP runs on OSX natively. No X11 environment
   is required.

Native build

   The official GIMP 2.10 DMG installer (linked above) is a stock GIMP
   build without any add-ons. Just open the downloaded DMG and drag and
   drop GIMP into your "Applications" folder.

   The SHA256 hash sum for gimp-2.10.12-x86_64.dmg is:
   8b964ad3dbbe31d0fa48fb834aa4c17fc0eb81becbc4595a57b04e3d4fc6efeb

Older Downloads

   Previous installers for OSX can be found here: download.gimp.org.

Macports

   An easy way to compile and install GIMP and other great Free software
   on your Mac is by using Macports. The installer allows you to choose
   from a large directory of packages. To install gimp using Macports, you
   simply do sudo port install gimp once you have Macports installed.

   Last we checked, the GIMP port file pointed to the current stable
   release and we have reports from people who've built GIMP successfully
   this way.
     * Download Macports

Homebrew

   Homebrew is similar to Macports and provides packages (aka formulas) to
   install, either by compiling them from source or by using pre-made
   binaries. There are indications that there is now a formula for GIMP,
   installable with: brew tap caskroom/cask && brew cask install gimp.
     * Download Homebrew

   NOTE! Please be aware that it was announced recently that Homebrew is
   using analytics. To turn this off in homebrew then run: brew analytics
   off
   You can read more about this on Brew Analytics.

Fink

   Fink is a package repository that offer mostly precompiled binaries. It
   provides the apt-get command known to e.g. Debian and Ubuntu users, and
   installing GIMP is as easy as sudo apt-get install gimp once you have
   installed the Fink installer.
   If there's no binary package, then fink install gimp will compile GIMP
   from source.

   Disclaimer: we haven't been able to determine if it is possible to
   install or build recent GIMP from Fink. Last we checked, GIMP 2.6.12
   appears to be the most recent GIMP package that is offered there.
     * Download Fink

   local help. By default, they will place the help files with your GIMP
   installation.

   Note: GIMP uses online help by default. If you want to use this local
   help offline, you will need to change GIMP's help settings.
    1. In GIMP, select [Edit] > [Preferences] > [Help System]
    2. For "User manual", select "Use a locally installed copy"
    3. Under "Help Browser", you can choose between your system's web
       browser and GIMP's help browser plugin (if available).

   Please consider using one of the mirrors listed below.

Development snapshots

   We now have a separate page for development versions of GIMP.

   Want to check out the GIMP development release?
   Get it on our development downloads page.

FTP and Web Mirrors

   We had a server move a while back that caused us to lose our existing
   mirrors (moved from physical to virtual server and to an environment
   that doesn't allow FTP access). On the plus side, we are now able to
   offer rsync access to download.gimp.org.

   If you are running one of the existing GIMP mirrors, or want to create
   a new one, please contact us to get your rsync credentials.
