   "What affects 20 million people, robs the global economy of billions of
   dollars and can be fixed with a five-minute procedure? The answer is
   cataract blindness."
   [4_logo_Forbes.png]

   "HelpMeSee has now developed a smartphone app for use by local
   community screeners working to identify patients in the field as well
   as a surgical reporting system to monitor quality of care. It’s a new
   breed of IT… and we call it ‘Technology For Good’."
   [29_Logos_TheHindu.png]

   "HelpMeSee’s technology includes a focus on simulation-based learning
   to train tens of thousands of specialists needed to carry out cataract
   surgery in the developing world."
   [30_Logo_Takepart.png]

   ​"Many eye care health workers are still slogging away filling out
   patient details on paper forms, taking days to transfer files, and not
   having time to follow up with patients after surgery. One nonprofit has
   come up with a solution."
   [31_PressLogos_HuffPoNew.png]

   "There is a global public health problem that sits quietly in the
   shadows of international media coverage, one that affects one child
   born every minute and has a comparable mortality rate of 60% in that
   child’s first year: blindness."
