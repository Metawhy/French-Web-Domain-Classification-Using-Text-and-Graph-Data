Partnership Grants

Do you have a great idea for bringing research alive in school?

   Partnership Grants of up to £3000 are available to schools to enable
   students, aged 5 – 18, to carry out science, technology, engineering or
   mathematics (STEM) projects. Additionally we are looking to support
   projects on computing and data science.
   Students working on their Partnership Grants project

Applying for this scheme

   The 2019 round of Partnership Grants is now closed.

   The next round of Partnership Grants will open in 2020.

   Since it started in November 2000, the Partnership Grants scheme has
   awarded over £1.3 million to over 800 schools and colleges, igniting
   enthusiasm for STEM in thousands of young people across the UK. Since
   2010, 88% of awarded Partnership Grants partners reported that they
   would apply again.

Why apply for this scheme?

   The Partnership Grants scheme offers up to £3000 to UK schools or
   colleges to buy equipment to run a STEM investigation project in
   partnership with a STEM professional (research or industry). Successful
   projects:
     * Deliver a better understanding of the latest developments in STEM;
     * Improve perceptions of those working in STEM professions;
     * Give students pride and ownership in STEM from participation in the
       investigative process.

Who can apply for this scheme?

   Whilst the initial application must be started by the school partner so
   that they are the primary applicant, there needs to be two project
   partners on the same application form. The partnership needs to be
   established before starting the application. The two partners are:
     * School partner (the primary applicant): any teacher or support
       staff at the main school, such as a computing teacher or a science
       technician; and a
     * STEM partner: an individual that is currently working in a STEM
       related profession, such as a researcher or analyst.

   For specific enquiries, please contact the Education Outreach team
   directly on education@royalsociety.org or by calling 020 7451 2531.

Partnership Grants

Do you have a great idea for bringing research alive in school?

   Partnership Grants of up to £3000 are available to schools to enable
   students, aged 5 – 18, to carry out science, technology, engineering or
   mathematics (STEM) projects. Additionally we are looking to support
   projects on computing and data science.
   Students working on their Partnership Grants project

Applying for this scheme

   The 2019 round of Partnership Grants is now closed.

   The next round of Partnership Grants will open in 2020.

   Since it started in November 2000, the Partnership Grants scheme has
   awarded over £1.3 million to over 800 schools and colleges, igniting
   enthusiasm for STEM in thousands of young people across the UK. Since
   2010, 88% of awarded Partnership Grants partners reported that they
   would apply again.

Why apply for this scheme?

   The Partnership Grants scheme offers up to £3000 to UK schools or
   colleges to buy equipment to run a STEM investigation project in
   partnership with a STEM professional (research or industry). Successful
   projects:
     * Deliver a better understanding of the latest developments in STEM;
     * Improve perceptions of those working in STEM professions;
     * Give students pride and ownership in STEM from participation in the
       investigative process.

Who can apply for this scheme?

   Whilst the initial application must be started by the school partner so
   that they are the primary applicant, there needs to be two project
   partners on the same application form. The partnership needs to be
   established before starting the application. The two partners are:
     * School partner (the primary applicant): any teacher or support
       staff at the main school, such as a computing teacher or a science
       technician; and a
     * STEM partner: an individual that is currently working in a STEM
       related profession, such as a researcher or analyst.

   For specific enquiries, please contact the Education Outreach team
   directly on education@royalsociety.org or by calling 020 7451 2531.
