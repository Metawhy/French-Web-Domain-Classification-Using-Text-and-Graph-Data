     "If you have forms, you need to analyze their performance. Formisimo
     does a very good job at providing in-depth information that really
     helps with optimization efforts. Useful data, simple interface. It
     is form analytics that actually works, especially when compared to
     some mouse tracking tools that have form analytics as one of the
     many features."

Powerful Form Insights

Formisimo turns deep form-behaviour data into reports that show you where the
issues are.

   Data on its own won't improve your business. But harvesting insight,
   monitoring progression to see what changes worked and optimising your
   way to success will.

   Formisimo has been created to provide deep insight on user behaviour in
   your forms, and to present that in engaging and relevant reports. Our
   insight is created from the thousands of data points that we capture on
   each customer as they complete your forms, and our reports have been
   created to highlight specific issues and optimisation opportunities in
   your forms.

   We designed Formisimo for teams that don’t have the luxury of a data
   scientist. Our 57 metrics will show you exactly where your biggest
   problems are. You don’t need to perform complicated data analysis to
   begin making improvements.

What is Form Analytics?

   Form analytics screenshot on laptop

   Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics and other platforms measure visitors
   and pages. They're important platforms for understanding visitor
   journeys.

   Form Analytics measures visitors and what they do in forms. Your
   visitors will have more inputs in a single page of your forms and
   checkout process than they would over the entire rest of their user
   journey. Understanding what they do in each part of your form is vital
   to understand how you can improve your forms. If a form is the
   gatekeeper to value, then improving it is key to increasing
   conversions. If your checkout conversion rate is an important KPI then
   optimizing the form steps of your checkout will increase your
   conversion rate.

Find Form Optimisation Opportunities Faster

   Form Analytics reveals the pain points and problems that users have. It
   shows you which fields suck up the most time, where users drop out, how
   users flow through fields, and many more metrics. It's precise
   analytics that measures engagement with fields, not engagement with
   pages, and it's the best way to see how you can improve your form and
   checkout.
