   Get ready to re-enter the Matrix.

   Lana Wachowski is set to write and direct a fourth film set in the
   world of “The Matrix,” with Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss reprising
   their roles as Neo and Trinity, respectively.

   Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures will produce and
   globally distribute the film. Warner Bros. Picture Group chairman Toby
   Emmerich made the announcement on Tuesday.

   “We could not be more excited to be re-entering ‘The Matrix’ with
   Lana,” said Emmerich. “Lana is a true visionary — a singular and
   original creative filmmaker — and we are thrilled that she is writing,
   directing and producing this new chapter in ‘The Matrix’ universe.”

   In addition to Wachowski, the script was also written by Aleksandar
   Hemon and David Mitchell. Wachowski is also producing with Grant Hill.
   Sources say the film is eyed to begin production at the top of 2020.

(EXCLUSIVE)

   Warner Bros. has been trying for the last of couple years to find a way
   to get back into “The Matrix” universe, but a hold-up over producing
   rights slowed the project down. Over the past couple of months, the
   studio saw an opportunity to ramp up development, with Reeves boasting
   a strong summer that included box office hits “John Wick 3” and “Toy
   Story 4” and a script from Wachowski that drummed up excitement.

   Plot details are currently unknown, as is how the role of Morpheus will
   be handled, originally played by Laurence Fishburne. Some sources say
   the role may be recast for a younger take.

   The three previous films —“The Matrix,” “The Matrix Reloaded” and “The
   Matrix Revolutions” — have collectively earned more than $1.6 billion
   at the global box office. All three were written and directed by Lana
   and her sister, Lilly, and starred Reeves and Moss.

   “Many of the ideas Lilly and I explored 20 years ago about our reality
   are even more relevant now. I’m very happy to have these characters
   back in my life and grateful for another chance to work with my
   brilliant friends,” Wachowski said.

   The first “Matrix” had its 20th anniversary this year, marked by
   special screenings at select AMC locations starting on Aug. 30.

   Wachowski is represented by WME, Circle of Confusion and attorney Peter
   Grossman. Reeves is represented by WME and Ziffren Brittenham. Moss is
   represented by WME, longtime manager Elizabeth Hodgson and attorney Bob
   Lange.

   Disney’s Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures have hit an impasse on new
   financing terms for upcoming Spider-Man movies, sources have told
   Variety.

   If a deal cannot be reached, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige will
   not produce future Spider-Man films, effectively removing Tom Holland’s
   Spider-Man from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

   Reps for Disney, Marvel and Sony had no comment. The dispute stems from
   Disney’s demand that future Spider-Man films would be financed on a
   50/50 basis with Feige remaining in a consulting producer capacity.
   Sony is believed to have proposed keeping the arrangement under the
   current terms, which stipulate that Marvel receives about 5% of
   first-dollar gross and all merchandising revenues.

   One source said that a deal might still be reached between Disney and
   Sony but there are no talks currently going on. Disney is believed to
   have expressed concerns that Feige was spread too thin due to other
   Marvel projects plus original projects for Disney Plus.

Coming Soon: Inside the Battle to Find the Right Movie Release Date

'Frozen II's' Jonathan Groff on Coming Back as Kristoff

   “Spider-Man: Far From Home,” produced by Feige and Amy Pascal, recently
   surpassed “Skyfall” to become Sony Pictures’ highest worldwide box
   office grosser.

   Feige achieved his first full producer credits more than a decade ago
   on “Iron Man” and “The Incredible Hulk.” His films have a combined
   worldwide box office gross of over $26.8 billion, and he received a
   nomination for the Academy Award for best picture for producing “Black
   Panther” this year, marking the first superhero film ever to receive a
   best picture nomination.

   Feige also produced “Avengers: Endgame,” which surpassed “Avatar” this
   summer as the highest-grossing film of all time.

   In 2015, Disney, Marvel and Sony announced a deal to share the
   Spider-Man film rights, which led to Holland portraying a younger
   version of Spider-Man in  “Captain America: Civil War,” “Spider-Man:
   Homecoming,” “Avengers: Infinity War,” “Avengers: Endgame” and
   “Spider-Man: Far From Home.” Sony distributed the films in which
   Spider-Man was the main character while Disney handled the other
   titles.

   Sony is widely believed to be developing two more Spider-Man movies
   with Holland reprising his role as the webslinger but has not
   officially announced those titles. The news about the impasse was first
   reported by Deadline.

When Could Taylor Swift Re-Record Her Big Machine Songs? It’s Complicated

   Florida, USA - 18 Aug 2018

   Her few words echoed around the world within minutes: Asked in a
   preview of her forthcoming “CBS This Morning” interview whether she
   might re-record her master recordings from her Big Machine, which are
   now owned and controlled by her nemesis, Justin Bieber manager Scooter
   Braun, Taylor Swift said, “Oh yeah.”

   Asked whether she plans to: “Oh, absolutely.”

   No further details were provided, but the remarks open up a plethora of
   legal questions about when and how Swift could re-record her catalog,
   and thus snatch income from Big Machine by making sure that her new
   versions, and not the ones owned by her former label, are the ones
   played by fans and used in any number of commercial ventures, such as
   advertisements, TV shows, movies, games and other uses.

   [UPDATE: After this article published, Swift revealed on “Good Morning
   America” Thursday that her contract with Big Machine allows her to
   re-record songs from her first five albums beginning in November of
   next year. “My contract says starting from November 2020 I can start
   re-recording albums 1-5,” she said.”]

VMA 2019 Fashion Moments: From Taylor Swift to Lizzo to Lil Nas X

   Prince and Def Leppard are two artists who successfully went that route
   in the past when they felt they were being unfairly compensated by
   their original labels, but their contracts dated back to the 1970s.
   Record companies quickly got wise to the practice and wrote provisions
   into their standard contracts setting a time period — typically two
   years after an album’s terms expire or five years after the release of
   the recording — before those same songs, which include live versions,
   could be released.

   Without direct knowledge of Swift’s contract, unnamed sources are
   batting around both sides of the coin. On one side, the assertion that
   Swift would be unable to re-record songs from her catalog until five
   years from 2018, when her deal with Big Machine officially expired, and
   even then the process would be prohibitively complicated. For example,
   she may not have access to the album’s original artwork or even the
   names of the songs.

   On the flip side, an insider tells Variety that Swift believes she can
   re-record her classics and that a smart lawyer — Swift’s is Donald
   Passman, one of the top attorneys in the industry and the man who
   literally wrote the book on the music industry — would not allow a
   severe re-record restriction in their artist’s contract. This source
   suggests that any album more than five years old is fair game.

   Laurie Soriano, a top music industry attorney and partner in the firm
   King, Holmes, Paterno & Soriano, who has no involvement in the Swift
   contract, says she doesn’t see any reason why Swift couldn’t move ahead
   with new versions of her songs and points to the practice by legacy
   artists to do the same. Once an artist’s deal with their label expires,
   that artist has “a contractural right to record for a new label and for
   [both entities] to make money off those recordings,” she tells Variety.
   “Standard language is two years after the end of the term or five years
   after the release of the recording in question.”

   However, some contracts do have what is called an original production
   or “sound alike” clause, which prohibits a newly recorded version from
   being too similar to the original — if that’s the case with her
   contract, a Swift-sung reggaeton version of “Mean” or a heavy metal
   take on “Love Story” could have moved closer to reality. But Soriano
   says it’s “an unusual provision” for a label to make seeing as interest
   in the catalogs often spurs consumption of both the original and new
   versions.

   To be sure, Swift has made her fans more than aware of her feelings
   about Braun’s acquisition of her masters, and it’s likely that a large
   percentage of them will follow her to whichever versions of her songs
   she asks them to. Then again, others may prefer the original. Any such
   confusion may ultimately have an adverse effect on perception of the
   worth of the Big Machine catalog, potentially devaluing the assets.

   On the other hand, that’s a question of the future. Right now, rights
   to master recording are seen as incredibly valuable one-of-a-kind works
   of art, not unlike that of a famous painter. If Braun were to sell
   today, at multiples of 22x to 25x, he’d be looking at a $1 billion
   valuation for a company he and backers Carlyle Group spent $300 million
   to buy.

   If Swift’s battle history is any indication, this one is far from over…

   Johnny Flynn Stardust

   Salon Pictures has unveiled a first look image of Johnny Flynn as David
   Bowie in its upcoming feature “Stardust.”

   Rising star Flynn, who recently starred in Michael Pearce’s
   BAFTA-winning debut feature “Beast” and co-starred in the ITV and
   Amazon Studio’s adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray’s “Vanity
   Fair,” stars as the music icon as he embarks on his first road trip to
   America in 1971 and creates his, now legendary, Ziggy Stardust persona.
   Jena Malone co-stars as Bowie’s wife Angie alongside Marc Maron as
   publicist Rob Oberman.

   The project has been described as a “origins story” and “moment in time
   film” rather than a biopic by its producers, who likened it to British
   features “Control” and “Nowhere Boy,” about Joy Division and John
   Lennon, respectively. As such it is not reliant on using Bowie’s music
   but will instead use period music songs that the musician covered, not
   his original tracks.

   The film was first announced in January and drew criticism at the time
   from Bowie’s son Duncan Jones, who said on Twitter that no music rights
   had been granted and the project did not have the family’s blessing.

   “Stardust” is directed by Gabriel Range and written by Christopher
   Bell. It is produced by Paul Van Carter and Nick Taussig for Salon. The
   film is co-financed by Christopher Figg of Piccadilly Pictures. Fabien
   Westerhoff’s Film Constellation is handling worldwide rights.

   Ryan Murphy Walk of Fame
   CREDIT: David Buchan/Variety/REX/Shutter

   At the Time 100 Summit on Tuesday, Ryan Murphy revealed that he has 10
   greenlit projects in the pipeline at Netflix, including three
   documentaries, four TV shows, and three movies.

   Murphy has previously announced five titles slated for a Netflix
   release. Three are shows, including “Ratched,” the drama series
   starring Sarah Paulson as the infamous Nurse Ratched; “The Politician,”
   a political satire featuring Ben Platt; and “Hollywood,” which focuses
   on the golden age of Tinseltown.

   He has also announced two Netflix film adaptations of Broadway
   productions. The first is “The Prom,” set for a September 2020 debut,
   and the other is “The Boys in the Band” with Jim Parsons and Zachary
   Quinto, also due out in 2020.

   Netflix said they could not provide further information about Murphy’s
   work at this time.

   The multi-hyphenate appeared on the Time 100 stage with Janet Mock, who
   writes and produces for “Pose,” the FX series Murphy co-created about
   1980s ball culture in New York City. Murphy spoke more about his record
   Netflix deal, reported to be in the $250-$300 million range. The
   five-year pact, under which Murphy will produce content exclusively for
   Netflix, began July 1, 2018, when his deal with 20th Century Fox TV
   expired.

   Murphy said signing with Netflix was both the “hardest thing I’ve ever
   done and the easiest thing I’ve ever done,” as the company gave him the
   freedom to create what he wanted and a platform to showcase new, young
   voices.

   “I was able to say what I felt my worth was, and it was met. And I was
   astonished,” Murphy said. “It was a great moment for me. I didn’t feel
   like the picked-on kid anymore.”

   When speaking on creating content in the current era, Murphy said, “If
   you’re not writing about women or gender or race, you’re not writing.”

   He added that “there aren’t any obstacles anymore” when it comes to
   progress in Hollywood and his focus is on championing more people that
   need to be heard. Although Mock said there should be diversity behind
   the camera, she noted the fact that three of the most powerful TV
   scribes are Murphy and Greg Berlanti — two gay men — and Shonda Rhimes,
   as a sign that the industry is heading in right direction.

   Get ready to re-enter the Matrix.

   Lana Wachowski is set to write and direct a fourth film set in the
   world of “The Matrix,” with Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss reprising
   their roles as Neo and Trinity, respectively.

   Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures will produce and
   globally distribute the film. Warner Bros. Picture Group chairman Toby
   Emmerich made the announcement on Tuesday.

   “We could not be more excited to be re-entering ‘The Matrix’ with
   Lana,” said Emmerich. “Lana is a true visionary — a singular and
   original creative filmmaker — and we are thrilled that she is writing,
   directing and producing this new chapter in ‘The Matrix’ universe.”

   In addition to Wachowski, the script was also written by Aleksandar
   Hemon and David Mitchell. Wachowski is also producing with Grant Hill.
   Sources say the film is eyed to begin production at the top of 2020.

(EXCLUSIVE)

   Warner Bros. has been trying for the last of couple years to find a way
   to get back into “The Matrix” universe, but a hold-up over producing
   rights slowed the project down. Over the past couple of months, the
   studio saw an opportunity to ramp up development, with Reeves boasting
   a strong summer that included box office hits “John Wick 3” and “Toy
   Story 4” and a script from Wachowski that drummed up excitement.

   Plot details are currently unknown, as is how the role of Morpheus will
   be handled, originally played by Laurence Fishburne. Some sources say
   the role may be recast for a younger take.

   The three previous films —“The Matrix,” “The Matrix Reloaded” and “The
   Matrix Revolutions” — have collectively earned more than $1.6 billion
   at the global box office. All three were written and directed by Lana
   and her sister, Lilly, and starred Reeves and Moss.

   “Many of the ideas Lilly and I explored 20 years ago about our reality
   are even more relevant now. I’m very happy to have these characters
   back in my life and grateful for another chance to work with my
   brilliant friends,” Wachowski said.

   The first “Matrix” had its 20th anniversary this year, marked by
   special screenings at select AMC locations starting on Aug. 30.

   Wachowski is represented by WME, Circle of Confusion and attorney Peter
   Grossman. Reeves is represented by WME and Ziffren Brittenham. Moss is
   represented by WME, longtime manager Elizabeth Hodgson and attorney Bob
   Lange.

   Disney’s Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures have hit an impasse on new
   financing terms for upcoming Spider-Man movies, sources have told
   Variety.

   If a deal cannot be reached, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige will
   not produce future Spider-Man films, effectively removing Tom Holland’s
   Spider-Man from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

   Reps for Disney, Marvel and Sony had no comment. The dispute stems from
   Disney’s demand that future Spider-Man films would be financed on a
   50/50 basis with Feige remaining in a consulting producer capacity.
   Sony is believed to have proposed keeping the arrangement under the
   current terms, which stipulate that Marvel receives about 5% of
   first-dollar gross and all merchandising revenues.

   One source said that a deal might still be reached between Disney and
   Sony but there are no talks currently going on. Disney is believed to
   have expressed concerns that Feige was spread too thin due to other
   Marvel projects plus original projects for Disney Plus.

Coming Soon: Inside the Battle to Find the Right Movie Release Date

'Frozen II's' Jonathan Groff on Coming Back as Kristoff

   “Spider-Man: Far From Home,” produced by Feige and Amy Pascal, recently
   surpassed “Skyfall” to become Sony Pictures’ highest worldwide box
   office grosser.

   Feige achieved his first full producer credits more than a decade ago
   on “Iron Man” and “The Incredible Hulk.” His films have a combined
   worldwide box office gross of over $26.8 billion, and he received a
   nomination for the Academy Award for best picture for producing “Black
   Panther” this year, marking the first superhero film ever to receive a
   best picture nomination.

   Feige also produced “Avengers: Endgame,” which surpassed “Avatar” this
   summer as the highest-grossing film of all time.

   In 2015, Disney, Marvel and Sony announced a deal to share the
   Spider-Man film rights, which led to Holland portraying a younger
   version of Spider-Man in  “Captain America: Civil War,” “Spider-Man:
   Homecoming,” “Avengers: Infinity War,” “Avengers: Endgame” and
   “Spider-Man: Far From Home.” Sony distributed the films in which
   Spider-Man was the main character while Disney handled the other
   titles.

   Sony is widely believed to be developing two more Spider-Man movies
   with Holland reprising his role as the webslinger but has not
   officially announced those titles. The news about the impasse was first
   reported by Deadline.

When Could Taylor Swift Re-Record Her Big Machine Songs? It’s Complicated

   Florida, USA - 18 Aug 2018

   Her few words echoed around the world within minutes: Asked in a
   preview of her forthcoming “CBS This Morning” interview whether she
   might re-record her master recordings from her Big Machine, which are
   now owned and controlled by her nemesis, Justin Bieber manager Scooter
   Braun, Taylor Swift said, “Oh yeah.”

   Asked whether she plans to: “Oh, absolutely.”

   No further details were provided, but the remarks open up a plethora of
   legal questions about when and how Swift could re-record her catalog,
   and thus snatch income from Big Machine by making sure that her new
   versions, and not the ones owned by her former label, are the ones
   played by fans and used in any number of commercial ventures, such as
   advertisements, TV shows, movies, games and other uses.

   [UPDATE: After this article published, Swift revealed on “Good Morning
   America” Thursday that her contract with Big Machine allows her to
   re-record songs from her first five albums beginning in November of
   next year. “My contract says starting from November 2020 I can start
   re-recording albums 1-5,” she said.”]

VMA 2019 Fashion Moments: From Taylor Swift to Lizzo to Lil Nas X

   Prince and Def Leppard are two artists who successfully went that route
   in the past when they felt they were being unfairly compensated by
   their original labels, but their contracts dated back to the 1970s.
   Record companies quickly got wise to the practice and wrote provisions
   into their standard contracts setting a time period — typically two
   years after an album’s terms expire or five years after the release of
   the recording — before those same songs, which include live versions,
   could be released.

   Without direct knowledge of Swift’s contract, unnamed sources are
   batting around both sides of the coin. On one side, the assertion that
   Swift would be unable to re-record songs from her catalog until five
   years from 2018, when her deal with Big Machine officially expired, and
   even then the process would be prohibitively complicated. For example,
   she may not have access to the album’s original artwork or even the
   names of the songs.

   On the flip side, an insider tells Variety that Swift believes she can
   re-record her classics and that a smart lawyer — Swift’s is Donald
   Passman, one of the top attorneys in the industry and the man who
   literally wrote the book on the music industry — would not allow a
   severe re-record restriction in their artist’s contract. This source
   suggests that any album more than five years old is fair game.

   Laurie Soriano, a top music industry attorney and partner in the firm
   King, Holmes, Paterno & Soriano, who has no involvement in the Swift
   contract, says she doesn’t see any reason why Swift couldn’t move ahead
   with new versions of her songs and points to the practice by legacy
   artists to do the same. Once an artist’s deal with their label expires,
   that artist has “a contractural right to record for a new label and for
   [both entities] to make money off those recordings,” she tells Variety.
   “Standard language is two years after the end of the term or five years
   after the release of the recording in question.”

   However, some contracts do have what is called an original production
   or “sound alike” clause, which prohibits a newly recorded version from
   being too similar to the original — if that’s the case with her
   contract, a Swift-sung reggaeton version of “Mean” or a heavy metal
   take on “Love Story” could have moved closer to reality. But Soriano
   says it’s “an unusual provision” for a label to make seeing as interest
   in the catalogs often spurs consumption of both the original and new
   versions.

   To be sure, Swift has made her fans more than aware of her feelings
   about Braun’s acquisition of her masters, and it’s likely that a large
   percentage of them will follow her to whichever versions of her songs
   she asks them to. Then again, others may prefer the original. Any such
   confusion may ultimately have an adverse effect on perception of the
   worth of the Big Machine catalog, potentially devaluing the assets.

   On the other hand, that’s a question of the future. Right now, rights
   to master recording are seen as incredibly valuable one-of-a-kind works
   of art, not unlike that of a famous painter. If Braun were to sell
   today, at multiples of 22x to 25x, he’d be looking at a $1 billion
   valuation for a company he and backers Carlyle Group spent $300 million
   to buy.

   If Swift’s battle history is any indication, this one is far from over…

   Johnny Flynn Stardust

   Salon Pictures has unveiled a first look image of Johnny Flynn as David
   Bowie in its upcoming feature “Stardust.”

   Rising star Flynn, who recently starred in Michael Pearce’s
   BAFTA-winning debut feature “Beast” and co-starred in the ITV and
   Amazon Studio’s adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray’s “Vanity
   Fair,” stars as the music icon as he embarks on his first road trip to
   America in 1971 and creates his, now legendary, Ziggy Stardust persona.
   Jena Malone co-stars as Bowie’s wife Angie alongside Marc Maron as
   publicist Rob Oberman.

   The project has been described as a “origins story” and “moment in time
   film” rather than a biopic by its producers, who likened it to British
   features “Control” and “Nowhere Boy,” about Joy Division and John
   Lennon, respectively. As such it is not reliant on using Bowie’s music
   but will instead use period music songs that the musician covered, not
   his original tracks.

   The film was first announced in January and drew criticism at the time
   from Bowie’s son Duncan Jones, who said on Twitter that no music rights
   had been granted and the project did not have the family’s blessing.

   “Stardust” is directed by Gabriel Range and written by Christopher
   Bell. It is produced by Paul Van Carter and Nick Taussig for Salon. The
   film is co-financed by Christopher Figg of Piccadilly Pictures. Fabien
   Westerhoff’s Film Constellation is handling worldwide rights.

   Ryan Murphy Walk of Fame
   CREDIT: David Buchan/Variety/REX/Shutter

   At the Time 100 Summit on Tuesday, Ryan Murphy revealed that he has 10
   greenlit projects in the pipeline at Netflix, including three
   documentaries, four TV shows, and three movies.

   Murphy has previously announced five titles slated for a Netflix
   release. Three are shows, including “Ratched,” the drama series
   starring Sarah Paulson as the infamous Nurse Ratched; “The Politician,”
   a political satire featuring Ben Platt; and “Hollywood,” which focuses
   on the golden age of Tinseltown.

   He has also announced two Netflix film adaptations of Broadway
   productions. The first is “The Prom,” set for a September 2020 debut,
   and the other is “The Boys in the Band” with Jim Parsons and Zachary
   Quinto, also due out in 2020.

   Netflix said they could not provide further information about Murphy’s
   work at this time.

   The multi-hyphenate appeared on the Time 100 stage with Janet Mock, who
   writes and produces for “Pose,” the FX series Murphy co-created about
   1980s ball culture in New York City. Murphy spoke more about his record
   Netflix deal, reported to be in the $250-$300 million range. The
   five-year pact, under which Murphy will produce content exclusively for
   Netflix, began July 1, 2018, when his deal with 20th Century Fox TV
   expired.

   Murphy said signing with Netflix was both the “hardest thing I’ve ever
   done and the easiest thing I’ve ever done,” as the company gave him the
   freedom to create what he wanted and a platform to showcase new, young
   voices.

   “I was able to say what I felt my worth was, and it was met. And I was
   astonished,” Murphy said. “It was a great moment for me. I didn’t feel
   like the picked-on kid anymore.”

   When speaking on creating content in the current era, Murphy said, “If
   you’re not writing about women or gender or race, you’re not writing.”

   He added that “there aren’t any obstacles anymore” when it comes to
   progress in Hollywood and his focus is on championing more people that
   need to be heard. Although Mock said there should be diversity behind
   the camera, she noted the fact that three of the most powerful TV
   scribes are Murphy and Greg Berlanti — two gay men — and Shonda Rhimes,
   as a sign that the industry is heading in right direction.

   As “Game of Thrones” creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss shop an
   overall global deal around town, the field has narrowed to Netflix,
   Amazon and Disney, sources tell Variety.

   Earlier chatter pointed to rival players such as Comcast-owned
   NBCUniversal and HBO parent WarnerMedia also jockeying for a chance to
   ink an agreement with the showrunners, one that would span film,
   television and other platforms.

   But it now appears that the two streamers and Disney are the major
   contenders for the duo’s future efforts.

   Benioff and Weiss have already formed ties to Disney, and are currently
   working on a lucrative piece of intellectual property, developing an
   untitled “Star Wars” movie that’s set to debut in theaters in 2022.

   That will be the first of several new “Star Wars” films the pair have
   signed on to write and produce with Disney’s Lucasfilm. It is no doubt
   a time-consuming feat, and one likely to be a consideration for any
   studio mulling a pact with the creative pair, who will have their hands
   full for an indeterminate amount of time.

   Sources tell Variety Apple was at one point interested in the pair’s
   business, but is no longer considered a major contender.
   Representatives for it and the other studios mentioned declined to
   comment.

   Regardless of the divisive series finale, the final season of “Game of
   Thrones” earned a record 32 Emmy nominations last week, pushing up
   HBO’s total to 137 and helping the network to retake the lead over
   Netflix, which procured 117 noms this year. The show’s series finale
   brought in 19.3 million viewers.

   Benioff and Weiss aren’t the only creators out looking to strike a
   massive new deal. J.J. Abrams is said to be nearing the finish line as
   WarnerMedia outpaces the pack in the race for his business. In recent
   years, Netflix has inked overall deals with Jenji Kohan, Shonda Rhimes,
   Ryan Murphy and Kenya Barris. Amazon Studios has first-look deals with
   Jordan Peele, Nicole Kidman, John Krasinski, Barry Jenkins and Rachel
   Brosnahan, and has overall deals with creators including Neil Gaiman
   and Glenn Kessler.

   Amazon has previously forged ties to other creatives in the “Game of
   Thrones” universe. Bryan Cogman, the writer and co-executive producer
   on “Game of Thrones” who worked closely alongside Benioff and Weiss, in
   September signed an overall deal with Amazon. He is currently
   consulting on the forthcoming “Lord of the Rings” series at the
   streamer.

   HBO programming chief Casey Bloys told Variety at the Television
   Critics Association press tour on Wednesday that the pair was among the
   best he’s worked with.

   “I think wherever they end up, they’ll be lucky to have them,”  said
   Bloys. “They’re some of the best showrunners I’ve ever worked with, and
   in this talent marketplace, I think everybody should go and get
   whatever they can. Who knows how long this market will last, so
   everybody’s gotta go out and get paid.”

Apple to Show First Original Series Clips at March Event but Launch Still
Months Away

   Apple is going to give the world a first glimpse at its marquee video
   content at a press event in Cupertino, Calif., at the end of next
   month, where the iPhone maker is expected to show clips of its original
   series. However, sources familiar with the company’s plans told Variety
   that original series on the service may not launch until the summer, or
   even fall.

   Apple is planning to invite press and partners to a media event on its
   Cupertino campus on March 25, a date that was first reported by
   BuzzFeed. It is expected to show off its video service, and likely also
   unveil a separate news subscription service at the event. A company
   representative declined to comment on the matter.

   At the event, Apple is expected to show off clips from shows that are
   in the works for the video service, including the first glimpse of
   Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, and Steve Carell in the untitled
   drama set behind the scenes of a network news morning show.

   Sources familiar with the plans say Apple’s video service will be
   targeted for a launch in summer or fall rather than the April timing
   that has been the subject of media speculation. Apple has vowed to its
   high-caliber producing partners to mount marketing blitzes on behalf of
   the shows in addition to the service itself. There’s an awareness that
   stars such as Aniston and Witherspoon do not want to take a back seat
   to promotion for the video service launch itself.

   Sources also cautioned that specific plans for the press event and how
   the video service will be introduced could be in flux until the minutes
   before Cook steps on stage. Apple prizes secrecy and the surprise
   factor at its public events, which means the company is likely to keep
   even its creative partners guessing until the day arrives. Bloomberg
   reported Wednesday that the company had invited Aniston, Witherspoon,
   Jennifer Garner, and J.J. Abrams to attend. Sources tell Variety that
   other talent associated with upcoming Apple content, including Jane
   Krakowski and Hailee Steinfeld, have been invited to attend.

   In addition to original content produced in-house, Apple’s service will
   also offer access to third-party subscription services, which will be
   sold as a la carte add-ons. Some of the partners expected to
   participate include CBS and Viacom, according to people familiar with
   the matter. HBO is said to be still in discussions with Apple, but is
   widely expected to sign on at some point as well.

   Netflix and Hulu, on the other hand, won’t participate, which is not a
   big surprise: Apple plans to offer add-on subscriptions for services
   like Starz and Showtime within its own app, doing away with the need to
   download a separate app for each and every network. Netflix in
   particular is known to be very protective of its own app experience,
   and hasn’t ever licensed its catalog to be used in this way. Hulu,
   meanwhile, directly competes with Apple’s upcoming service, as it also
   resells Showtime, HBO, and Starz to its audience.

   Apple’s plans to resell premium subscription services as add-ons follow
   Amazon’s lead; the ecommerce giant’s Amazon Channels video subscription
   marketplace has become the biggest reseller of paid video services
   since its launch in December of 2015. BMO Capital Markets estimated in
   December that Channels brought in $1.7 billion in revenue in 2018.

   In addition to premium networks, Amazon also resells a number of
   second-tier video services via Channels. At least at launch, Apple
   seems to be going down a different route for its own service: Operators
   of some of the smaller video services available via Channels told
   Variety this week that they haven’t had far-reaching discussions with
   the company yet.

   To headline its own service, Apple has struck a number of high-profile
   deals with A-list directors and actors including Abrams, Gardner, Oprah
   Winfrey, Aniston, and Witherspoon. Apple shows that have completed
   production on their first seasons or are well along include the new
   take on “Amazing Stories”; “Are You Sleeping,” a detective drama
   starring Octavia Spencer; and the futuristic “See,” starring Jason
   Momoa.

   Apple’s push into premium comes as the company is looking to boost its
   services revenue amid stagnating iPhone sales. In January, Apple
   revealed that its iPhone revenue for the holiday quarter was down 15%
   year-over-year. During the earnings call for that quarter, Apple CEO
   Tim Cook said the company was seeing cord cutting and the move to
   online video accelerate. “We see huge changes in customer behavior
   taking place now,” Cook said. “It will likely take place at a much
   faster pace this year.”

   Todd Spangler, Daniel Holloway, and Joe Otterson contributed to this
   report.

       leaders were right to spend $130 billion-plus on transformative
       acquisitions of Time Warner and DirecTV over the past four years.
       The 34-year AT&T veteran and CEO of WarnerMedia doesn’t intend to

   Netflix wants you to know: It doesn’t have any plans now or in the
   future to start running commercials on its streaming service.

   Company execs have have regularly explained that being ad-free is a
   core part of Netflix’s attractiveness to consumers, and the strategy
   has been a standard part of its “Long-Term View” mission statement for
   investors: “We don’t offer pay-per-view or free ad-supported content.
   Those are fine business models that other firms do well. We are about
   flat-fee unlimited viewing commercial-free.”

   On Wednesday, as part of announcing second-quarter 2019 earnings,
   Netflix spelled out in no uncertain terms that it’s not going to be
   putting ads in front of its viewers.

   “We, like HBO, are advertising free,” the company said in its letter to
   investors. “That remains a deep part of our brand proposition; when you
   read speculation that we are moving into selling advertising, be
   confident that this is false. We believe we will have a more valuable
   business in the long term by staying out of competing for ad revenue
   and instead entirely focusing on competing for viewer satisfaction.”

   There’s been regular speculation that Netflix could be tempted into
   rolling into selling ads — or that the company would be forced to in
   order to sustain its high levels of content spending.

   In a report last month, analysts at Nomura’s Instinet calculated that
   Netflix could generate more than $1 billion in ad revenue per year if
   it launched a plan with advertising, with $700 million of that dropping
   to the bottom line.

   But the analysis of Netflix’s potential for advertising doesn’t fully
   account for the fact that any ad-supported service from Netflix would
   cannibalize its existing business (i.e., subscribers would move down to
   cheaper ad plan from ad-free tiers). Moreover, it doesn’t factor in the
   investment that would be necessary to stand up an advertising platform
   and sales force.

   Industry observers have ruminated about Netflix’s advertising
   opportunity given the long-successful dual-revenue streams of TV
   networks (which make money through both ads and distribution fees).
   Then there’s Hulu, which says it generated $1.4 billion in ad revenue
   in 2018 and that about 70% of its viewers are on the $5.99 plan with
   commercials.

   During Netflix’s Q2 video interview Wednesday, CFO Spencer Neumann said
   the company expects to continue to increase margins — without selling
   advertising — by increasing the scale of its user base. Netflix
   projects that it will be able to hit a “multiple” of its current 151.6
   million subscriber base.

   “Our calculus now for building a global network is that we’re best
   served to focus on that single revenue stream… and offer [the service]
   at a reasonable price,” Neumann said. “We think the subscription model
   is a terrific model for us.”

   “The OA” will not be back for a third season at Netflix, Variety has
   learned.

   The mystery thriller starred Brit Marling as a blind woman who
   disappeared seven years ago only to suddenly return with her sight
   restored. Now referring to herself as The OA, or Original Angel, she
   then recruits a small team to help rescue other people who have
   disappeared by opening a portal to another dimension.

   Marling co-created the series along with Zal Batmanglij in addition to
   starring. Both also executive produced along with Brad Pitt, Dede
   Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner, and Sarah Esberg from Plan B Entertainment and
   Anonymous Content’s Michael Sugar.

   “We are incredibly proud of the 16 mesmerizing chapters of ‘The OA,’
   and are grateful to Brit and Zal for sharing their audacious vision and
   for realizing it through their incredible artistry,” said Cindy
   Holland, vice president of original content for Netflix. “We look
   forward to working with them again in the future, in this and perhaps
   many other dimensions.”

   Netflix does not typically release viewership data, with the streamer
   having said multiple times in the past, however, that they take
   viewership versus cost into account when deciding whether or not to
   renew a show.

   In addition to Marling, the series also starred Emory Cohen, Patrick
   Gibson, Jason Isaacs, Ian Alexander, Phyllis Smith, Brendan Meyer,
   Brandon Perea, Will Brill, Sharon Van Etten, Scott Wilson, Alice Krieg,
   and Paz Vega.

   Season 1 of “The OA” debuted in December 2016, while Season 2 debuted
   nearly three years later in March of this year. The series received
   mostly positive reviews from critics, with the two eight-episode
   seasons averaging an 84% critical approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes
   between them.

   MADRID  — In the second all-time record-breaking global bow for Netflix
   this July, Alex Pina’s Spanish-language “La Casa de Papel” – “Money
   Heist” – Part 3 was watched by 34,355,956 Netflix household accounts
   over its first seven days after a July 19 global launch, Netflix
   confirmed to Variety on Thursday.

   That’s the best first-week global result ever for a Netflix
   non-English-language series. As importantly, as Netflix drives ever
   more into original series production around the world, “La Casa de
   Papel” Part 3 also broke records as the most-watched Netflix series or
   film of all time in any language, including English, in many key
   territories around the world.

   Those countries take in not only ‘Casa’ creator Pina’s native Spain but
   also France and Italy as well as Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Portugal
   and “many others,” according to Diego Ávalos, director of originals in
   Spain. He added that Part 3 had also “reached a lot of people” in
   India. “We are proud of bringing stories that are made in Spain, to the
   world,” he said.

Coming Soon: Inside the Battle to Find the Right Movie Release Date

'Orange Is the New Black' Creator Jenji Kohan and Star Uzo Aduba Bid Farewell

   This performance turns the social-issue laced action-thriller into the
   biggest case in point to date of one of Netflix’s biggest gameplays as
   it forges an ever more international future: Its capacity to produce
   shows and movies around the world that not only drive up the household
   subscriptions in their country of origin but also across the globe.

   Remarkably, above 70% of household accounts – north of 24.0 million –
   finished “La casa de Papel” Part 3 in its first week. That full-on
   binging compares to the 18.2 million who watched “Stranger Things”
   Season 3 completely as it set a new all-time launch record for Netflix
   from its July 4 launch being watched by a first four-day 40.7 million
   household accounts.

   Why “La Casa de Papel” 3 has rocked is a moot question.

   Mixing tones – action, passion and comedy at one and the same time –
   which you don’t see much in U.S. series, Avalos said –  “La Casa de
   Papel” Part 3 was made at a budget which allowed it to compete with
   other international series, argued producer Cristina López at Vancouver
   Media, Pina’s Madrid production house which made the series with
   Netflix.

   In Parts 1 and 2, the Professor cherry picks criminals – ex-cons,
   misfits, social write offs – to carry out a perfect heist at the Royal
   Mint of Spain. “La Casa de Papel” ·talks about “the marginalized, how
   they find a way forward. It’s something we can all identify with,” said
   Avalos. “It has been loved by fans all around the world because of the
   authenticity and originality of the storytelling.”

   Part 3 also marks a step up in emotion, Avalos suggested. In it, the
   gang targets the Bank of Spain, in a desperate attempt to free one gang
   member Rio, who’s been captured. The robbery is also carried out by the
   Professor as a homage to Berlin, his brother, who originally thought up
   the plan.

   Part 3 is about “love,” Avalos argued: “Love towards the world, others,
   themselves, other gang members who become family.”

   It also connects Spanish, Latino or Latin culture, call it what you
   like, with the international world, said López. One crucial difference
   with parts 1 and 2, said Pedro Alonso, who plays the refined but
   embittered Berlin, is that Parts 1 and 2 captured the Professor’s
   “impecable” planning as he played a “chess game” with authorities.
   Berlin’s planned assault on the Bank of Spain, in contrast, has it
   flaws, which the Professor  doesn’t have time to correct.

   So the gang at times has to improvise.

   “Latinos often have to make do with few resources, so they’ve learnt to
   be very good at innovation,” Avalos said.

   “In U.S. British culture, there’s an aggression. The response is a
   perfect plan. no flaws. In Part 3, in contrast, there are losses,
   deaths, problems, betrayal.” That said, “Latinos, however, disastrous,
   can pull off the seemingly impossible.

   Alonso also argued that the series appeals to a sense of industry sea
   change.

   “Before, there was a feeling in Spain, the Latin world of being on the
   periphery of the real reference, the U.S industry, which, in film and
   TV, marked the 20th century” Alonso said.

   He added: “Now there’s a new sentiment, that we can compete in terms of
   production levels, and create a brand which is more alive. That’s
   historical,and Italians, the French, Turks, industry executives and
   audiences, are embracing ‘La Casa de Papel’ as their own.”
