Abstract

Introduction

   Dioxins are environmental and persistent pollutants mostly emitted from
   combustion facilities (e.g. waste incinerators, metal and cement
   industries). Known to be endocrine disrupting chemicals, dioxins are
   suspected to increase breast cancer (BC) risk. Although diet is
   considered the primary source of dioxin exposure, no previous study has
   been published on dietary dioxin exposure in relation to BC risk. We
   aimed to assess dietary dioxin exposure among women from the E3N cohort
   and estimate BC risk associated with this exposure.

Methods

   The study included 63,830 women from the E3N cohort who completed a
   diet history questionnaire (DHQ) in 1993 and were followed until 2008.
   Dietary dioxin exposure was estimated by combining consumption data
   from the E3N DHQ and food dioxin contamination data from a French
   national monitoring program. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence
   intervals (CI) were estimated by Cox models adjusted for BC risk
   factors.

Results

   Mean dietary dioxin exposure was estimated at 1.3 ± 0.4 pg/kg body
   weight (BW)/day. A 0.4 pg/kg BW/d increase in dioxin intake was not
   associated with overall BC risk (HR = 1.00; 95% CI: 0.96, 1.05). A
   significant decrease in risk of estrogen receptor negative
   (ER-)/progesterone receptor negative (PR-) tumors was observed among
   post-menopausal women in the upper quartile of estimated dioxin intake
   (HR for Q4 vs. Q1: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.96; P for trend across
   quartiles = 0.0463).

Conclusions

   Overall, no association between estimated dietary dioxin exposure and
   BC risk was found among E3N women. Further studies should include both
   dietary and environmental exposures to determine whether low-dose
   dioxin exposure is associated with BC risk.

Introduction

   Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and polychlorinated
   dibenzofurans (PCDF), together defined as dioxins, are toxic
   environmental by-products resulting from the incomplete combustion of
   chlorinated substances from metal and cement industries, waste
   incinerators or domestic activities. Because they are highly lipophilic
   and persistent pollutants, dioxins can contaminate the food chain and
   accumulate in adipose tissues [1]. Therefore, in the general
   population, diet is considered one of the main sources of exposure to
   dioxins [1-3]. Most of the studies assessing dietary dioxin exposure
   concluded that food from animal origin rich in fat such as dairy
   products and meat, and seafood are the most contaminated foods. Because
   contribution of specific food groups to dioxin exposure depends on
   their consumption, main contributors might differ between populations
   due to different dietary patterns.

   Dioxins are known to be endocrine disrupting chemicals [4] and
   suspected to play a role in the increase of hormone-related cancer
   incidence such as breast cancer. The
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is the most toxic congener
   and has been classified as carcinogenic to humans by the International
   Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the US Environmental
   Protection Agency (US EPA) [5,6].

   Few epidemiological studies have investigated breast cancer risk
   associated with dioxin exposure, and there have been inconsistent
   results. Among the cohort of residents exposed to TCDD following the
   Seveso accident (Italy, 1976), no increased breast cancer risk was
   observed among women living in the areas most exposed to TCDD [7,8].
   Nevertheless, elevated serum TCDD levels measured in Seveso women who
   lived in the two most contaminated zones were associated with increased
   breast cancer risk in a first analysis conducted in 2002 [9]. However,
   this was not confirmed with longer follow up of the same population
   [10]. Studies conducted among cohorts of workers exposed to dioxins
   during production of herbicides showed higher breast cancer mortality
   in these populations (reviewed in [11,12]). Other studies also reported
   elevated breast cancer mortality [13] and increased breast cancer risk
   [14] in cohorts of community residents exposed to dioxins emitted by
   industrial facilities. However in a French case-control study, a
   decrease in breast cancer risk was observed among older women living
   near a municipal solid-waste incinerator (MSWI) and most exposed to
   dioxins [15].

   To our knowledge no epidemiological study has explored the association
   between dioxin exposure through diet and breast cancer risk. Therefore,
   our study aimed to assess dietary dioxin exposure among women from the
   French E3N prospective cohort and estimate breast cancer risk
   associated with this exposure.

Methods

The E3N cohort study

   The E3N (Etude Epidémiologique auprès de femmes de la Mutuelle Générale
   de l'Education Nationale) study is an ongoing prospective cohort
   involving 98,995 French female volunteers, born between 1925 and 1950
   and members of a national teachers’ health insurance plan [16]. The E3N
   study was initiated to identify female cancer risk factors, especially
   dietary, hormonal and reproductive factors. The study began in 1990
   when participants returned the first questionnaire and gave signed
   informed consent. Since then women have completed self-administered
   questionnaires sent by mail every 2 to 3 years about their lifestyle,
   health status and medical history. The E3N study protocol was approved
   by the French National Commission for Data Protection and Privacy.

Study population

   Women included in our study population were participants of the E3N
   study, who had completed the E3N diet history questionnaire (DHQ) in
   1993 and were followed until June 2008. Among the 74,522 women with
   dietary data, women having under- or over-reported their consumption,
   that is, those in the bottom and top 1% of the energy intake to basal
   metabolic rate ratio computed on the basis of age, height and weight,
   were excluded (n = 1,360). In addition, we excluded women who reported
   cancer diagnosis (except non-melanoma skin cancer) before completing
   the E3N DHQ (n = 4,705) along with those who developed in situ breast
   cancer (n = 483) and those for whom follow-up information was
   unavailable (n = 822). We further excluded 3,302 women with missing
   body weight (BW) in 1993 and 20 women who had never menstruated.
   Finally 63,830 women were included in our study population.

Breast cancer cases

   From the third self-administered questionnaire to the ninth, data on
   health status and medical history of women, including cancer
   occurrence, were collected and updated. A total of 3,465 women reported
   primary invasive breast cancer between 1993 and 2008 and 92% of them
   were confirmed by pathology reports. Information on estrogen receptor
   (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) were extracted from these reports,
   and invasive breast cancer cases were classified as ER+/PR+ (n =
   1,596), ER+/PR- (n = 561) or ER-/PR- (n = 414). Because of the small
   number of cases, the ER-/PR+ invasive breast cancers were not
   considered in the analyses (n = 107). Because the proportion of
   false-positive self-reported breast cancer in the E3N cohort was <5%,
   breast cancers not confirmed by pathology report (n = 285) were
   considered as cases. Deaths were identified through family contact or
   from insurance files, and causes of death were obtained from the French
   National Service on Causes of Death [17].

Assessment of dietary dioxin exposure

Consumption data

   Dietary data were collected from a validated self-administered DHQ,
   specifically developed for the assessment of the previous year's usual
   diet of the E3N population and sent in 1993 [18]. The E3N DHQ covered
   the daily consumption of 208 food items by collecting food frequencies
   and portion sizes for 8 meals and snacks during the day. The
   questionnaire comprised both a quantitative and a qualitative part. In
   the quantitative part, women were asked to indicate the frequency of
   consumption and to estimate portion sizes of food groups, food items
   and beverages. Portion sizes were estimated with a validated photo
   booklet [19]. The qualitative part provided detailed information on
   women’s relative consumption frequency of specific food items within
   one of the food groups of the first part. Furthermore, a food
   composition table was generated from a French national database [20],
   providing information on fat content of most of the food items assessed
   in the E3N DHQ.

Contamination data

   An assessment of the level of food contamination by dioxins (PCDDs and
   PCDFs) in France was published in 2000 by the French High Council for
   Public Health (Conseil Supérieur d’Hygiène Publique de France (CSHPF))
   [21]. These contamination data were based on food samples collected
   from 1996 to 1998 which was the closest period to the E3N DHQ. Food
   samples analyzed in this report (n = 444) included dairy products,
   meats, seafood products, cereal products, fruits and vegetables, eggs
   and fats (Additional file 1: Table S1). They were collected from
   monitoring and control plans mostly performed by the Directorate for
   food of the French Agriculture ministry (DGAL) and the General
   Directorate for Competition Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control
   (DGCCRF). Measurements of dioxin contamination in these samples were
   performed in one single laboratory (Carso Laboratory, Lyon, France)
   with a certified method using high-resolution gas
   chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS). Dioxin
   concentrations were calculated with the lower-bound method, assuming
   that non-detected congeners were equal to zero. Results were expressed
   in pg TEQ/g lipid weight, except for foods from vegetal origin (that
   is, cereal products and fruit and vegetables) for which results were
   expressed in pg TEQ/g fresh weight.

Exposure assessment

   Dietary dioxin exposure in our study was estimated for each woman, by
   combining consumption data from the E3N DHQ and lipid levels from the
   food composition table developed by the E3N team with food dioxins
   contamination data from the CSHPF report (Additional file 1: Table S1),
   using the following formulas recommended by the World Health
   Organization (WHO) [22]:

   where E [i] is the dietary dioxin exposure for the woman i (in pg
   TEQ/kg BW/day), C [i,k] is the consumption of the food k by the woman i
   (in g/day), F [k] is the proportion of lipids of the food k (in %), L
   [k] is the average dioxin contamination of the food k (in pg TEQ/g
   lipid weight, see equation 1), P [k] is the average dioxin
   contamination of the food k (in pg TEQ/g fresh weight, see equation 2)
   and BW [i] is the body weight of the woman i (in kg) reported in the
   E3N questionnaire of 1993.

   The intake of PCDDs and PCDFs was calculated in toxic equivalent (TEQ)
   using toxic equivalence factors (TEF) first developed by the North
   Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1989 [23]. In 2001, the WHO
   established a dioxin-tolerable daily intake of 2.3 pg TEQ/kg BW/day
   [24,25].

Statistical analysis

   Participants contributed person-years of follow up from the date they
   completed the E3N DHQ to the date of diagnosis of primary invasive
   breast cancer, date of death, date of return of the ninth questionnaire
   or June 2008, whichever occurred first. Estimated dietary dioxin
   exposure was categorized according to quartiles of its distribution in
   the study population. Baseline characteristics of the participants were
   described by quartiles of estimated dietary dioxin exposure using mean
   and standard deviation (SD) for quantitative variables and frequency
   and percentage for qualitative variables.

   Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for breast cancer
   were estimated for an increase of 0.43 pg TEQ/kg BW/day (that is, 1 SD)
   and for quartiles of estimated dietary dioxin exposure with first
   quartile used as reference, using Cox proportional hazard models,
   stratified by 5-year-interval birth cohorts (from 1925 to 1950).
   Women’s age was used as the timescale. To evaluate potential
   dose-response associations, tests for linear trend across quartiles
   were derived from the Wald test of the models with the semi-continuous
   variable. All models were adjusted for known breast cancer risk factors
   and potential confounders: height (cm), body mass index (BMI) before
   and after menopause (cut off: 25, 30 kg/m^2; considered as a
   time-dependent variable), total energy intake excluding alcohol
   (kcal/day), alcohol intake (cut off: 0, 6.9 g/day), education
   (undergraduate/postgraduate with a 1- to 4-year university
   degree/postgraduate with a 5+ year university degree), physical
   activity at baseline (cut off: 34, 46, 62 metabolic equivalent
   task-hour per week (MET-h/w)), smoking status (never
   smoked/ex-smoker/current smoker; time-dependent variable), age at
   menarche (cut off: 12, 14 years), previous use of oral contraceptives
   (never/ever), previous use of progestin before menopause (never/ever),
   menopausal status combined with use of menopausal hormone treatment
   (MHT) (premenopausal/postmenopausal non-using of MHT/postmenopausal
   using of MHT; time-dependent variable), age at menopause (cut off: 47,
   54 years, among postmenopausal women only), age at first full-term
   pregnancy combined with number of live births (no child/≤2 children and
   age at first birth <30 years/≤2 children and age at first birth
   ≥30 years/≥3 children), breastfeeding (never/ever), previous family
   history of breast cancer (yes/no), previous history of personal benign
   breast disease (yes/no; time-dependent variable), previous mammography
   (yes/no; time-dependent variable). Further adjustments for food group
   consumption (including fruit and vegetable, fish and seafood, dairy
   products or total dietary flavonoid intake) were made. All adjustment
   variables had less than 5% missing data that were replaced by their
   modal or median value in the population. Information on estimated
   dietary dioxin exposure was available for all women of the study
   population.

   We also estimated risk of invasive breast cancer according to hormone
   receptor status (ER/PR). We excluded cases for whom joint
   hormone-receptor status (n = 787) was missing from the corresponding
   analyses. Interactions between BMI and estimated dietary dioxin
   exposure were tested among premenopausal and postmenopausal women in
   relation to breast cancer risk because of opposite associations between
   BMI and risk of breast cancer before and after menopause [26] and the
   storage of dioxins in adipose tissues. Analyses were also stratified by
   weight change during follow up (cut points >−2 kg/5 years;
   >2 kg/5 years) and dietary patterns ("Western" vs. "Healthy" patterns
   [27]). Because of previously observed negative associations, we studied
   interactions between estimated dietary dioxin exposure and smoking
   status, and breastfeeding [28,29] while interaction between estimated
   dietary dioxin exposure and alcohol consumption was studied due to
   potential positive association [30]. All tests for interaction were
   derived from the likelihood-ratio test comparing the models with and
   without an interaction term. Sensitivity analysis was performed,
   excluding breast cancer cases diagnosed less than 2 years after
   completing the E3N DHQ, to eliminate possible preclinical tumors. All
   P-values were two-sided and the significance level was set at 0.05. We
   used the SAS statistical software version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc.,
   Cary, NC, USA) for data analysis.

Results

   We analyzed data from 63,830 women with a median follow up of
   14.9 years, corresponding to 888,505 person-years and during which
   3,465 incident invasive breast cancers occurred. The food groups most
   consumed were fruit and vegetables (mean ± SD: 724.8 ± 288.5 g/d),
   dairy products (341.0 ± 200.1 g/d) and cereal products (247.7 ±
   108.8 g/d, Table 1). Fish and seafood were less frequently consumed
   (38.0 ± 27.2 g/d). The average level of dietary dioxin exposure was
   estimated at 1.3 ± 0.4 pg TEQ/kg BW/d (range: 0.1 to 5.7 pg TEQ/kg
   BW/d) and 2.7% of women exceeded the 2.3 pg TEQ/kg BW/d toxicity
   threshold established by the WHO [24,25]. The highest contributors to
   the total estimated dietary dioxin exposure were dairy products
   (33.3%), fruit and vegetables (22.1%), meat (18.8%) and fish and
   seafood (15.6%), while the contribution from eggs (5.5%), cereal
   products (3.6%) and added fats (1.2%) was low.

   Higher estimated dietary dioxin exposure was seen in younger women and
   in those with higher energy intake, higher alcohol consumption, lower
   pre- and postmenopausal BMI, and in women with 1 or 2 children before
   30 years, with a personal history of benign breast disease and those
   who had breastfed at least one of their children (Table 2).

   Table 3 shows HRs associated with estimated dietary dioxin exposure
   among overall participants and according to hormone receptor status
   (ER/PR). An increase of 0.43 pg TEQ/kg BW/d in the intake of dioxins
   was not associated with risk of invasive breast cancer risk among
   overall participants, neither in the univariable nor in the
   multivariable models: HR = 1.01 (0.99, 1.03) and HR = 1.00 (0.96,
   1.05), respectively. There was no statistically significant linear
   trend between quartiles of estimated dietary dioxin exposure and breast
   cancer risk (P for trend = 0.9405). There was also no association
   between estimated dietary dioxin exposure and ER+/PR+ or ER+/PR- breast
   cancer risk. However a borderline statistically significant decrease in
   ER-/PR- breast cancer risk was observed across quartiles of estimated
   dietary dioxin exposure (HR for Q1 vs. Q4: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.50, 1.02; P
   for trend across quartiles = 0.0629). When stratifying by menopausal
   status, we observed a statistically significant decrease in ER-/PR-
   breast cancer risk (HR for Q4 vs. Q1: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.45, 0.96; P for
   trend across quartiles = 0.0463) (Table 4).

   Adjusting for fruit and vegetable consumption, total dietary flavonoid
   intake, or any other food groups, did not change the results (data not
   shown). There was no significant interaction between BMI and estimated
   dietary dioxin exposure among pre- and postmenopausal women in relation
   to invasive breast cancer risk. There was no effect modification by
   smoking, alcohol consumption, dietary patterns, gain or loss of weight
   during follow up and breastfeeding, and there was no association
   between estimated dietary dioxin exposure and breast cancer risk in any
   above-defined subgroups (Additional file 1: Table S2). Our results did
   not change when excluding breast cancer cases diagnosed less than
   2 years after inclusion (data not shown).

Discussion

   To our knowledge, this study is the first to assess breast cancer risk
   associated with dietary dioxin exposure. Among women from the E3N
   prospective cohort, we did not observe any increase of breast cancer
   risk associated with estimated dietary dioxin exposure. Among
   postmenopausal women, an inverse association was observed between
   estimated dioxin intake and ER-/PR- breast cancer risk.

   Our estimation of an average dioxin intake of 1.3 pg TEQ/kg BW/d is of
   the same order of magnitude or lower than in other studies. In a
   monitoring program conducted in 1996 to 1998 in the general French
   population and using the same dioxin contamination data as in our
   study, mean dietary dioxin exposure was also estimated at 1.3 pg TEQ/kg
   BW/d [21]. At the same period in Europe, estimated dietary dioxin
   exposure of the general population varied between 1.0 pg TEQ/kg BW/d
   (Germany) and 3.5 pg TEQ/kg BW/d (Spain) [31-34]. In the US, dietary
   dioxin exposure was estimated between 0.3 and 3.2 pg TEQ/kg BW/d [35].
   Dairy products and seafood were consistently identified across studies
   as being the main food contributors to dioxin exposure [21,32,34].
   However, because food contribution depends on dietary habits, some
   studies (including ours) showed an additional important contribution of
   cereal products and fruit and vegetables [31]. These foods, although
   little contaminated by dioxins, are highly consumed by some
   populations, and their contribution to overall dioxin intake must thus
   be considered. However, most previous studies focused on dioxin intake
   from foods known to be the most contaminated by dioxins and did not
   consider dioxin intake from consumption of foods from vegetal origin.
   This is likely to result in an underestimation of the intake of
   dioxins, as concluded in a validation study of a dietary questionnaire
   developed for the assessment of dietary dioxin exposure [36].

   Previous studies investigating the association between breast cancer
   and dioxin exposure (environmental, accidental and occupational) mostly
   reported a weak increase in the risk of breast cancer [9,14] or the
   mortality rates of breast cancer [11-13]. Our results are not
   consistent with those studies, probably because they have focused on
   populations exposed accidentally, occupationally or living near
   emitting sources of dioxins, that is, exposed to high levels of
   dioxins, whereas our study population was exposed to low levels of
   dioxins. Moreover, among the Seveso Women's Health Study (SWHS) [9],
   the results were obtained for a different exposure window than women
   from the E3N study, as the SWHS women were aged 0 to 40 at the time of
   exposure (1976) whereas in 1993, almost half of the women of our study
   population were postmenopausal.

   Our results suggest that exposure to dioxins in the low range observed
   in our study may be associated with a decreased risk of
   hormone-independent (ER-/PR-) breast cancer, especially after
   menopause. Inverse associations between endocrine disrupting chemicals
   and ER- breast cancer risk have been found previously. Raaschou-Nielsen
   et al. found a lower risk associated with higher adipose tissue
   concentrations of dioxin-like organochlorines in postmenopausal women
   [37]. Gammon et al. observed a lower risk of ER-/PR- breast cancer in
   women with serum levels of PCBs in the highest tertile compared to the
   lowest [38]. Some studies investigating breast cancer risk in relation
   to dioxin exposure also suggested a decreased breast cancer risk. A
   French registry-based case-control study conducted near a MSWI showed a
   decreased risk of invasive breast cancer among women aged over 60 years
   and highly exposed, compared to non-exposed women, although these
   results could be explained by confounding, because there was no
   adjustment on breast cancer risk factors or other potential confounders
   other than age and place of residence [15]. A small decrease in breast
   cancer risk was also observed among women exposed during the Seveso
   accident and followed between 1977 and 1986, although not statistically
   significant [7]. However, the authors of these studies did not stratify
   on tumor hormone receptor status. Our findings may also be supported by
   experimental evidence on the role of dioxins in promotion or inhibition
   of mammary tumor formation. TCDD has been shown to operate in animals
   and humans through binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR, [5]).
   Some studies have described an antiproliferative action of TCDD in ER-
   breast cancer cell lines through AhR-dependent [39,40] or
   AhR-independent pathways [41]. These observations were complemented by
   animal studies demonstrating that TCDD inhibits the proliferation of
   cells from the mammary gland and mammary tumor formation [42,43]. In a
   recent review of the literature on the role of AhR in carcinogenesis,
   Safe et al. highlighted the fact that the effect of TCDD may vary
   according to the target organ as well as windows of exposure [44]. For
   example, animal studies have demonstrated that prenatal TCDD exposure
   increased susceptibility to carcinogen-induced mammary tumor formation,
   while exposure during pregnancy delayed mammary tumor formation. Women
   of our study population were on average aged 57.2 ± 6.6 years old at
   inclusion in 1993. Therefore, we were not able to investigate the
   association of breast cancer risk with estimated dietary dioxin
   exposure during other windows of exposure such as prenatal periods or
   pregnancy.

Strengths and limitations

   Strengths of our study include the prospective design, the large size
   of the study population and number of breast cancer cases, a long
   follow-up that provides a large latency period for potential cancer
   occurrence, adjustment for most known breast cancer risk factors
   updated throughout follow-up, and validated dietary data. The
   participation rate which is still high 18 years after the start of the
   E3N study (≥75% at each follow-up questionnaire) and the low percentage
   of missing data attests of the quality of the information collected.
   Because our statistical models were adjusted for several individual
   breast cancer risk factors, it is unlikely that residual confounding
   changes our risk estimates. Moreover, we analyzed the potential
   confounding effect of flavonoid intake. Flavonoids are dietary
   phytochemicals that have been suggested to protect against dioxin
   toxicity [45] and to play a role in breast cancer prevention [46,47];
   adjustment for total dietary flavonoid intake did not change our
   results.

   Nevertheless, our study has some limitations. First, to determine
   dietary dioxin exposure, we used consumption data obtained through a
   semi-quantitative diet history questionnaire. DHQ are often used for
   their applicability to a large number of participants. However, as DHQ
   are self-administered questionnaires on habitual food consumption over
   the past 12 months, we cannot exclude some inaccuracy of consumption
   data and a non-differential bias due to the desire of conformity to
   social norms. Nevertheless, the potential lack of precision has been
   minimized by the collection of food frequency for each food item and
   the estimation of portion sizes through a photo-booklet. Moreover, both
   the dietary questionnaire and photo-booklet have been validated
   [18,19].

   Second, the food contamination data by dioxins came from the first
   French national monitoring program, which aimed to assess dioxin levels
   of foods sampled between 1996 and 1998 [21]. Because the authors did
   not achieve an exhaustive sampling plan, the data may not be
   representative of the dioxin contamination of food in France for that
   period. However, because of the large number of samples (n = 444), the
   coverage of all major food contributors of dioxin intake and the fact
   that those data were the closest to the period of the E3N DHQ
   administration, we can assume that they accurately reflect the
   contamination of food in 1993. We combined the consumption data with
   the contamination data using standardized formulas recommended by the
   WHO [22]. However, for some food items of the E3N DHQ, no contamination
   data were reported in the CSHPF study; therefore we assigned to each of
   these items the average contamination of the food group to which it
   belonged (see Additional file 1: Table S1 for an example).

   Also, we could not consider the source of the food consumed, that is,
   women living and consuming food produced near a dioxin emitting source
   may consume foods more contaminated than average. This could have led
   to an underestimation of the exposure for those women and to
   misclassification bias, although non differential so the risk would be
   potentially drawn toward 1. The estimated dietary dioxin exposure may
   not reflect the total exposure to dioxins of the E3N women. We cannot
   eliminate the contribution of exposure from environmental sources, even
   if its contribution remains probably minor compared to that of food. In
   contrast, because most women from the E3N cohort are teachers or from
   affiliated occupations, we can assume the occupational dioxin exposure
   to be negligible and homogeneous among study participants.

   Our estimation of the dietary dioxin exposure cannot be extrapolated to
   the French general population. Indeed, the intake of dioxins through
   the diet depends on the relative intake of foods of high or low levels
   of dioxin contamination and their quantity consumed (for instance, our
   population has a higher consumption of fruit and vegetables than
   generally observed). Moreover, we can expect a healthy participation
   effect in our cohort, as it is composed of volunteers with a high level
   of education and health consciousness. This could result in a possible
   underrepresentation of high fat (so high dioxin) consumptions; however
   this should not have biased our results.

Conclusion

   Among women from the E3N prospective cohort, estimated dietary dioxin
   exposure was not associated with breast cancer risk. Further studies
   should include both dietary and non-dietary (environmental) exposures
   as well as different windows of exposure (prenatal, pregnancy periods)
   in order to further investigate the complex association between
   low-dose dioxin exposure and hormone receptor-defined breast cancer
   risk.

Abstract

   Alcohol drinking and, to a lesser extent, cigarette smoking are risk
   factors for a first primary breast cancer. Information on these
   behaviours at diagnosis may contribute to risk prediction of
   contralateral breast cancer (CBC) and they are potentially modifiable.
   The WECARE Study is a large population-based case-control study of
   women with breast cancer where cases (N = 1,521) had asynchronous CBC
   and controls (N = 2,212), matched on survival time and other factors,
   had unilateral breast cancer (UBC). Using multivariable conditional
   logistic regression to estimate rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence
   intervals (CI), we examined the risk of CBC in relation to drinking and
   smoking history at and following first diagnosis. We adjusted for
   treatment, disease characteristics and other factors. There was some
   evidence for an association between CBC risk and current drinking or
   current smoking at the time of first breast cancer diagnosis, but the
   increased risk occurred primarily among women exposed to both
   (RR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.24-2.11). CBC risk was also elevated in women who
   both smoked and drank alcohol after diagnosis (RR = 1.54, 95% CI
   1.18-1.99). In the subset of women with detailed information on amount
   consumed, smoking an average of ≥10 cigarettes per day following
   diagnosis was also associated with increased CBC risk (RR = 1.50, 95%
   CI 1.08-2.08; p-trend = 0.03). Among women with a diagnosis of breast
   cancer, information on current drinking and smoking could contribute to
   the prediction of CBC risk. Women who both drink and smoke may
   represent a group who merit targeted lifestyle intervention to modify
   their risk of CBC.

   Disposal of used tires has been a major problem in solid waste
   management. New uses will have to be found to consume recycled tire
   products. One such proposed use is as ground cover in playgrounds.
   However, concern has been expressed regarding exposure of children to
   hazardous chemicals and the environmental impact of such chemicals. We
   designed a comprehensive hazard assessment to evaluate and address
   potential human health and environmental concerns associated with the
   use of tire crumb in playgrounds. Human health concerns were addressed
   using conventional hazard analyses, mutagenicity assays, and aquatic
   toxicity tests of extracted tire crumb. Hazard to children appears to
   be minimal. Toxicity to all aquatic organisms (bacteria, invertebrates,
   fish, and green algae) was observed; however, this activity disappeared
   with aging of the tire crumb for three months in place in the
   playground. We conclude that the use of tire crumb in playgrounds
   results in minimal hazard to children and the receiving environment.

Editor’s note:

   Today, more of the world’s population is bilingual or multilingual than
   monolingual. In addition to facilitating cross-cultural communication,
   this trend also positively affects cognitive abilities. Researchers
   have shown that the bilingual brain can have better attention and
   task-switching capacities than the monolingual brain, thanks to its
   developed ability to inhibit one language while using another. In
   addition, bilingualism has positive effects at both ends of the age
   spectrum: Bilingual children as young as seven months can better adjust
   to environmental changes, while bilingual seniors can experience less
   cognitive decline.

   We are surrounded by language during nearly every waking moment of our
   lives. We use language to communicate our thoughts and feelings, to
   connect with others and identify with our culture, and to understand
   the world around us. And for many people, this rich linguistic
   environment involves not just one language but two or more. In fact,
   the majority of the world’s population is bilingual or multilingual. In
   a survey conducted by the European Commission in 2006, 56 percent of
   respondents reported being able to speak in a language other than their
   mother tongue. In many countries that percentage is even higher—for
   instance, 99 percent of Luxembourgers and 95 percent of Latvians speak
   more than one language.1 Even in the United States, which is widely
   considered to be monolingual, one-fifth of those over the age of five
   reported speaking a language other than English at home in 2007, an
   increase of 140 percent since 1980.2 Millions of Americans use a
   language other than English in their everyday lives outside of the
   home, when they are at work or in the classroom. Europe and the United
   States are not alone, either. The Associated Press reports that up to
   66 percent of the world’s children are raised bilingual.3 Over the past
   few decades, technological advances have allowed researchers to peer
   deeper into the brain to investigate how bilingualism interacts with
   and changes the cognitive and neurological systems.

Cognitive Consequences of Bilingualism

   Research has overwhelmingly shown that when a bilingual person uses one
   language, the other is active at the same time. When a person hears a
   word, he or she doesn’t hear the entire word all at once: the sounds
   arrive in sequential order. Long before the word is finished, the
   brain’s language system begins to guess what that word might be by
   activating lots of words that match the signal. If you hear “can,” you
   will likely activate words like “candy” and “candle” as well, at least
   during the earlier stages of word recognition. For bilingual people,
   this activation is not limited to a single language; auditory input
   activates corresponding words regardless of the language to which they
   belong.4

   Some of the most compelling evidence for language co-activation comes
   from studying eye movements. We tend to look at things that we are
   thinking, talking, or hearing about.5 A Russian-English bilingual
   person asked to “pick up a marker” from a set of objects would look
   more at a stamp than someone who doesn’t know Russian, because the
   Russian word for “stamp,” “marka,” sounds like the English word he or
   she heard, “marker.”4 In cases like this, language co-activation occurs
   because what the listener hears could map onto words in either
   language. Furthermore, language co-activation is so automatic that
   people consider words in both languages even without overt similarity.
   For example, when Chinese-English bilingual people judge how alike two
   English words are in meaning, their brain responses are affected by
   whether or not the Chinese translations of those words are written
   similarly.6 Even though the task does not require the bilingual people
   to engage their Chinese, they do so anyway.

   Having to deal with this persistent linguistic competition can result
   in language difficulties. For instance, knowing more than one language
   can cause speakers to name pictures more slowly7 and can increase
   tip-of-the-tongue states (where you’re unable to fully conjure a word,
   but can remember specific details about it, like what letter it starts
   with).8 As a result, the constant juggling of two languages creates a
   need to control how much a person accesses a language at any given
   time. From a communicative standpoint, this is an important
   skill—understanding a message in one language can be difficult if your
   other language always interferes. Likewise, if a bilingual person
   frequently switches between languages when speaking, it can confuse the
   listener, especially if that listener knows only one of the speaker’s
   languages.

   To maintain the relative balance between two languages, the bilingual
   brain relies on executive functions, a regulatory system of general
   cognitive abilities that includes processes such as attention and
   inhibition. Because both of a bilingual person’s language systems are
   always active and competing, that person uses these control mechanisms
   every time she or he speaks or listens. This constant practice
   strengthens the control mechanisms and changes the associated brain
   regions.9–12

   Bilingual people often perform better on tasks that require conflict
   management. In the classic Stroop task, people see a word and are asked
   to name the color of the word’s font. When the color and the word match
   (i.e., the word “red” printed in red), people correctly name the color
   more quickly than when the color and the word don’t match (i.e., the
   word “red” printed in blue). This occurs because the word itself
   (“red”) and its font color (blue) conflict. The cognitive system must
   employ additional resources to ignore the irrelevant word and focus on
   the relevant color. The ability to ignore competing perceptual
   information and focus on the relevant aspects of the input is called
   inhibitory control. Bilingual people often perform better than
   monolingual people at tasks that tap into inhibitory control ability.
   Bilingual people are also better than monolingual people at switching
   between two tasks; for example, when bilinguals have to switch from
   categorizing objects by color (red or green) to categorizing them by
   shape (circle or triangle), they do so more rapidly than monolingual
   people,13 reflecting better cognitive control when changing strategies
   on the fly.

Changes in Neurological Processing and Structure

   Studies suggest that bilingual advantages in executive function are not
   limited to the brain’s language networks.9 Researchers have used brain
   imaging techniques like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
   investigate which brain regions are active when bilingual people
   perform tasks in which they are forced to alternate between their two
   languages. For instance, when bilingual people have to switch between
   naming pictures in Spanish and naming them in English, they show
   increased activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a
   brain region associated with cognitive skills like attention and
   inhibition.14 Along with the DLPFC, language switching has been found
   to involve such structures as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC),
   bilateral supermarginal gyri, and left inferior frontal gyrus
   (left-IFG), regions that are also involved in cognitive control.9 The
   left-IFG in particular, often considered the language production center
   of the brain, appears to be involved in both linguistic15 and
   non-linguistic cognitive control.16

   The neurological roots of the bilingual advantage extend to subcortical
   brain areas more traditionally associated with sensory processing. When
   monolingual and bilingual adolescents listen to simple speech sounds
   (e.g., the syllable “da”) without any intervening background noise,
   they show highly similar brain stem responses to the auditory
   information. When researchers play the same sound to both groups in the
   presence of background noise, the bilingual listeners’ neural response
   is considerably larger, reflecting better encoding of the sound’s
   fundamental frequency,17 a feature of sound closely related to pitch
   perception. To put it another way, in bilingual people, blood flow (a
   marker for neuronal activity) is greater in the brain stem in response
   to the sound. Intriguingly, this boost in sound encoding appears to be
   related to advantages in auditory attention. The cognitive control
   required to manage multiple languages appears to have broad effects on
   neurological function, fine-tuning both cognitive control mechanisms
   and sensory processes.

   Beyond differences in neuronal activation, bilingualism seems to affect
   the brain’s structure as well. Higher proficiency in a second language,
   as well as earlier acquisition of that language, correlates with higher
   gray matter volume in the left inferior parietal cortex.18 Researchers
   have associated damage to this area with uncontrolled language
   switching,19 suggesting that it may play an important role in managing
   the balance between two languages. Likewise, researchers have found
   white matter volume changes in bilingual children20 and older adults.21
   It appears that bilingual experience not only changes the way
   neurological structures process information, but also may alter the
   neurological structures themselves.

Improvements in Learning

   Being bilingual can have tangible practical benefits. The improvements
   in cognitive and sensory processing driven by bilingual experience may
   help a bilingual person to better process information in the
   environment, leading to a clearer signal for learning. This kind of
   improved attention to detail may help explain why bilingual adults
   learn a third language better than monolingual adults learn a second
   language.22 The bilingual language-learning advantage may be rooted in
   the ability to focus on information about the new language while
   reducing interference from the languages they already know.23 This
   ability would allow bilingual people to more easily access newly
   learned words, leading to larger gains in vocabulary than those
   experienced by monolingual people who aren’t as skilled at inhibiting
   competing information.

   Furthermore, the benefits associated with bilingual experience seem to
   start quite early—researchers have shown bilingualism to positively
   influence attention and conflict management in infants as young as
   seven months. In one study, researchers taught babies growing up in
   monolingual or bilingual homes that when they heard a tinkling sound, a
   puppet appeared on one side of a screen. Halfway through the study, the
   puppet began appearing on the opposite side of the screen. In order to
   get a reward, the infants had to adjust the rule they’d learned; only
   the bilingual babies were able to successfully learn the new rule.24
   This suggests that even for very young children, navigating a
   multilingual environment imparts advantages that transfer beyond
   language.

Protecting Against Age-Related Decline

   The cognitive and neurological benefits of bilingualism also extend
   into older adulthood. Bilingualism appears to provide a means of
   fending off a natural decline of cognitive function and maintaining
   what is called “cognitive reserve.”9, 25 Cognitive reserve refers to
   the efficient utilization of brain networks to enhance brain function
   during aging. Bilingual experience may contribute to this reserve by
   keeping the cognitive mechanisms sharp and helping to recruit alternate
   brain networks to compensate for those that become damaged during
   aging. Older bilingual people enjoy improved memory26 and executive
   control9 relative to older monolingual people, which can lead to
   real-world health benefits.

   In addition to staving off the decline that often comes with aging,
   bilingualism can also protect against illnesses that hasten this
   decline, like Alzheimer’s disease. In a study of more than 200
   bilingual and monolingual patients with Alzheimer’s disease, bilingual
   patients reported showing initial symptoms of the disease at about 77.7
   years of age—5.1 years later than the monolingual average of 72.6.
   Likewise, bilingual patients were diagnosed 4.3 years later than the
   monolingual patients (80.8 years of age and 76.5 years of age,
   respectively).25 In a follow-up study, researchers compared the brains
   of bilingual and monolingual patients matched on the severity of
   Alzheimer’s symptoms. Surprisingly, the brains of bilingual people
   showed a significantly higher degree of physical atrophy in regions
   commonly associated with Alzheimer’s disease.27 In other words, the
   bilingual people had more physical signs of disease than their
   monolingual counterparts, yet performed on par behaviorally, even
   though their degree of brain atrophy suggested that their symptoms
   should be much worse. If the brain is an engine, bilingualism may help
   to improve its mileage, allowing it to go farther on the same amount of
   fuel.

Conclusion

   The cognitive and neurological benefits of bilingualism extend from
   early childhood to old age as the brain more efficiently processes
   information and staves off cognitive decline. What’s more, the
   attention and aging benefits discussed above aren’t exclusive to people
   who were raised bilingual; they are also seen in people who learn a
   second language later in life.25, 28 The enriched cognitive control
   that comes along with bilingual experience represents just one of the
   advantages that bilingual people enjoy. Despite certain linguistic
   limitations that have been observed in bilinguals (e.g., increased
   naming difficulty7), bilingualism has been associated with improved
   metalinguistic awareness (the ability to recognize language as a system
   that can be manipulated and explored), as well as with better memory,
   visual-spatial skills, and even creativity.29 Furthermore, beyond these
   cognitive and neurological advantages, there are also valuable social
   benefits that come from being bilingual, among them the ability to
   explore a culture through its native tongue or talk to someone with
   whom you might otherwise never be able to communicate. The cognitive,
   neural, and social advantages observed in bilingual people highlight
   the need to consider how bilingualism shapes the activity and the
   architecture of the brain, and ultimately how language is represented
   in the human mind, especially since the majority of speakers in the
   world experience life through more than one language.

Abstract

   Geneticists study the gene; however, for epigeneticists, there is no
   obvious 'epigene'. Nevertheless, during the past year, more than 2,500
   articles, numerous scientific meetings and a new journal were devoted
   to the subject of epigenetics. It encompasses some of the most exciting
   contemporary biology and is portrayed by the popular press as a
   revolutionary new science--an antidote to the idea that we are
   hard-wired by our genes. So what is epigenetics?

Abstract

Introduction

   Dioxins are environmental and persistent pollutants mostly emitted from
   combustion facilities (e.g. waste incinerators, metal and cement
   industries). Known to be endocrine disrupting chemicals, dioxins are
   suspected to increase breast cancer (BC) risk. Although diet is
   considered the primary source of dioxin exposure, no previous study has
   been published on dietary dioxin exposure in relation to BC risk. We
   aimed to assess dietary dioxin exposure among women from the E3N cohort
   and estimate BC risk associated with this exposure.

Methods

   The study included 63,830 women from the E3N cohort who completed a
   diet history questionnaire (DHQ) in 1993 and were followed until 2008.
   Dietary dioxin exposure was estimated by combining consumption data
   from the E3N DHQ and food dioxin contamination data from a French
   national monitoring program. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence
   intervals (CI) were estimated by Cox models adjusted for BC risk
   factors.

Results

   Mean dietary dioxin exposure was estimated at 1.3 ± 0.4 pg/kg body
   weight (BW)/day. A 0.4 pg/kg BW/d increase in dioxin intake was not
   associated with overall BC risk (HR = 1.00; 95% CI: 0.96, 1.05). A
   significant decrease in risk of estrogen receptor negative
   (ER-)/progesterone receptor negative (PR-) tumors was observed among
   post-menopausal women in the upper quartile of estimated dioxin intake
   (HR for Q4 vs. Q1: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.96; P for trend across
   quartiles = 0.0463).

Conclusions

   Overall, no association between estimated dietary dioxin exposure and
   BC risk was found among E3N women. Further studies should include both
   dietary and environmental exposures to determine whether low-dose
   dioxin exposure is associated with BC risk.

Introduction

   Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and polychlorinated
   dibenzofurans (PCDF), together defined as dioxins, are toxic
   environmental by-products resulting from the incomplete combustion of
   chlorinated substances from metal and cement industries, waste
   incinerators or domestic activities. Because they are highly lipophilic
   and persistent pollutants, dioxins can contaminate the food chain and
   accumulate in adipose tissues [1]. Therefore, in the general
   population, diet is considered one of the main sources of exposure to
   dioxins [1-3]. Most of the studies assessing dietary dioxin exposure
   concluded that food from animal origin rich in fat such as dairy
   products and meat, and seafood are the most contaminated foods. Because
   contribution of specific food groups to dioxin exposure depends on
   their consumption, main contributors might differ between populations
   due to different dietary patterns.

   Dioxins are known to be endocrine disrupting chemicals [4] and
   suspected to play a role in the increase of hormone-related cancer
   incidence such as breast cancer. The
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is the most toxic congener
   and has been classified as carcinogenic to humans by the International
   Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the US Environmental
   Protection Agency (US EPA) [5,6].

   Few epidemiological studies have investigated breast cancer risk
   associated with dioxin exposure, and there have been inconsistent
   results. Among the cohort of residents exposed to TCDD following the
   Seveso accident (Italy, 1976), no increased breast cancer risk was
   observed among women living in the areas most exposed to TCDD [7,8].
   Nevertheless, elevated serum TCDD levels measured in Seveso women who
   lived in the two most contaminated zones were associated with increased
   breast cancer risk in a first analysis conducted in 2002 [9]. However,
   this was not confirmed with longer follow up of the same population
   [10]. Studies conducted among cohorts of workers exposed to dioxins
   during production of herbicides showed higher breast cancer mortality
   in these populations (reviewed in [11,12]). Other studies also reported
   elevated breast cancer mortality [13] and increased breast cancer risk
   [14] in cohorts of community residents exposed to dioxins emitted by
   industrial facilities. However in a French case-control study, a
   decrease in breast cancer risk was observed among older women living
   near a municipal solid-waste incinerator (MSWI) and most exposed to
   dioxins [15].

   To our knowledge no epidemiological study has explored the association
   between dioxin exposure through diet and breast cancer risk. Therefore,
   our study aimed to assess dietary dioxin exposure among women from the
   French E3N prospective cohort and estimate breast cancer risk
   associated with this exposure.

Methods

The E3N cohort study

   The E3N (Etude Epidémiologique auprès de femmes de la Mutuelle Générale
   de l'Education Nationale) study is an ongoing prospective cohort
   involving 98,995 French female volunteers, born between 1925 and 1950
   and members of a national teachers’ health insurance plan [16]. The E3N
   study was initiated to identify female cancer risk factors, especially
   dietary, hormonal and reproductive factors. The study began in 1990
   when participants returned the first questionnaire and gave signed
   informed consent. Since then women have completed self-administered
   questionnaires sent by mail every 2 to 3 years about their lifestyle,
   health status and medical history. The E3N study protocol was approved
   by the French National Commission for Data Protection and Privacy.

Study population

   Women included in our study population were participants of the E3N
   study, who had completed the E3N diet history questionnaire (DHQ) in
   1993 and were followed until June 2008. Among the 74,522 women with
   dietary data, women having under- or over-reported their consumption,
   that is, those in the bottom and top 1% of the energy intake to basal
   metabolic rate ratio computed on the basis of age, height and weight,
   were excluded (n = 1,360). In addition, we excluded women who reported
   cancer diagnosis (except non-melanoma skin cancer) before completing
   the E3N DHQ (n = 4,705) along with those who developed in situ breast
   cancer (n = 483) and those for whom follow-up information was
   unavailable (n = 822). We further excluded 3,302 women with missing
   body weight (BW) in 1993 and 20 women who had never menstruated.
   Finally 63,830 women were included in our study population.

Breast cancer cases

   From the third self-administered questionnaire to the ninth, data on
   health status and medical history of women, including cancer
   occurrence, were collected and updated. A total of 3,465 women reported
   primary invasive breast cancer between 1993 and 2008 and 92% of them
   were confirmed by pathology reports. Information on estrogen receptor
   (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) were extracted from these reports,
   and invasive breast cancer cases were classified as ER+/PR+ (n =
   1,596), ER+/PR- (n = 561) or ER-/PR- (n = 414). Because of the small
   number of cases, the ER-/PR+ invasive breast cancers were not
   considered in the analyses (n = 107). Because the proportion of
   false-positive self-reported breast cancer in the E3N cohort was <5%,
   breast cancers not confirmed by pathology report (n = 285) were
   considered as cases. Deaths were identified through family contact or
   from insurance files, and causes of death were obtained from the French
   National Service on Causes of Death [17].

Assessment of dietary dioxin exposure

Consumption data

   Dietary data were collected from a validated self-administered DHQ,
   specifically developed for the assessment of the previous year's usual
   diet of the E3N population and sent in 1993 [18]. The E3N DHQ covered
   the daily consumption of 208 food items by collecting food frequencies
   and portion sizes for 8 meals and snacks during the day. The
   questionnaire comprised both a quantitative and a qualitative part. In
   the quantitative part, women were asked to indicate the frequency of
   consumption and to estimate portion sizes of food groups, food items
   and beverages. Portion sizes were estimated with a validated photo
   booklet [19]. The qualitative part provided detailed information on
   women’s relative consumption frequency of specific food items within
   one of the food groups of the first part. Furthermore, a food
   composition table was generated from a French national database [20],
   providing information on fat content of most of the food items assessed
   in the E3N DHQ.

Contamination data

   An assessment of the level of food contamination by dioxins (PCDDs and
   PCDFs) in France was published in 2000 by the French High Council for
   Public Health (Conseil Supérieur d’Hygiène Publique de France (CSHPF))
   [21]. These contamination data were based on food samples collected
   from 1996 to 1998 which was the closest period to the E3N DHQ. Food
   samples analyzed in this report (n = 444) included dairy products,
   meats, seafood products, cereal products, fruits and vegetables, eggs
   and fats (Additional file 1: Table S1). They were collected from
   monitoring and control plans mostly performed by the Directorate for
   food of the French Agriculture ministry (DGAL) and the General
   Directorate for Competition Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control
   (DGCCRF). Measurements of dioxin contamination in these samples were
   performed in one single laboratory (Carso Laboratory, Lyon, France)
   with a certified method using high-resolution gas
   chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS). Dioxin
   concentrations were calculated with the lower-bound method, assuming
   that non-detected congeners were equal to zero. Results were expressed
   in pg TEQ/g lipid weight, except for foods from vegetal origin (that
   is, cereal products and fruit and vegetables) for which results were
   expressed in pg TEQ/g fresh weight.

Exposure assessment

   Dietary dioxin exposure in our study was estimated for each woman, by
   combining consumption data from the E3N DHQ and lipid levels from the
   food composition table developed by the E3N team with food dioxins
   contamination data from the CSHPF report (Additional file 1: Table S1),
   using the following formulas recommended by the World Health
   Organization (WHO) [22]:

   where E [i] is the dietary dioxin exposure for the woman i (in pg
   TEQ/kg BW/day), C [i,k] is the consumption of the food k by the woman i
   (in g/day), F [k] is the proportion of lipids of the food k (in %), L
   [k] is the average dioxin contamination of the food k (in pg TEQ/g
   lipid weight, see equation 1), P [k] is the average dioxin
   contamination of the food k (in pg TEQ/g fresh weight, see equation 2)
   and BW [i] is the body weight of the woman i (in kg) reported in the
   E3N questionnaire of 1993.

   The intake of PCDDs and PCDFs was calculated in toxic equivalent (TEQ)
   using toxic equivalence factors (TEF) first developed by the North
   Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1989 [23]. In 2001, the WHO
   established a dioxin-tolerable daily intake of 2.3 pg TEQ/kg BW/day
   [24,25].

Statistical analysis

   Participants contributed person-years of follow up from the date they
   completed the E3N DHQ to the date of diagnosis of primary invasive
   breast cancer, date of death, date of return of the ninth questionnaire
   or June 2008, whichever occurred first. Estimated dietary dioxin
   exposure was categorized according to quartiles of its distribution in
   the study population. Baseline characteristics of the participants were
   described by quartiles of estimated dietary dioxin exposure using mean
   and standard deviation (SD) for quantitative variables and frequency
   and percentage for qualitative variables.

   Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for breast cancer
   were estimated for an increase of 0.43 pg TEQ/kg BW/day (that is, 1 SD)
   and for quartiles of estimated dietary dioxin exposure with first
   quartile used as reference, using Cox proportional hazard models,
   stratified by 5-year-interval birth cohorts (from 1925 to 1950).
   Women’s age was used as the timescale. To evaluate potential
   dose-response associations, tests for linear trend across quartiles
   were derived from the Wald test of the models with the semi-continuous
   variable. All models were adjusted for known breast cancer risk factors
   and potential confounders: height (cm), body mass index (BMI) before
   and after menopause (cut off: 25, 30 kg/m^2; considered as a
   time-dependent variable), total energy intake excluding alcohol
   (kcal/day), alcohol intake (cut off: 0, 6.9 g/day), education
   (undergraduate/postgraduate with a 1- to 4-year university
   degree/postgraduate with a 5+ year university degree), physical
   activity at baseline (cut off: 34, 46, 62 metabolic equivalent
   task-hour per week (MET-h/w)), smoking status (never
   smoked/ex-smoker/current smoker; time-dependent variable), age at
   menarche (cut off: 12, 14 years), previous use of oral contraceptives
   (never/ever), previous use of progestin before menopause (never/ever),
   menopausal status combined with use of menopausal hormone treatment
   (MHT) (premenopausal/postmenopausal non-using of MHT/postmenopausal
   using of MHT; time-dependent variable), age at menopause (cut off: 47,
   54 years, among postmenopausal women only), age at first full-term
   pregnancy combined with number of live births (no child/≤2 children and
   age at first birth <30 years/≤2 children and age at first birth
   ≥30 years/≥3 children), breastfeeding (never/ever), previous family
   history of breast cancer (yes/no), previous history of personal benign
   breast disease (yes/no; time-dependent variable), previous mammography
   (yes/no; time-dependent variable). Further adjustments for food group
   consumption (including fruit and vegetable, fish and seafood, dairy
   products or total dietary flavonoid intake) were made. All adjustment
   variables had less than 5% missing data that were replaced by their
   modal or median value in the population. Information on estimated
   dietary dioxin exposure was available for all women of the study
   population.

   We also estimated risk of invasive breast cancer according to hormone
   receptor status (ER/PR). We excluded cases for whom joint
   hormone-receptor status (n = 787) was missing from the corresponding
   analyses. Interactions between BMI and estimated dietary dioxin
   exposure were tested among premenopausal and postmenopausal women in
   relation to breast cancer risk because of opposite associations between
   BMI and risk of breast cancer before and after menopause [26] and the
   storage of dioxins in adipose tissues. Analyses were also stratified by
   weight change during follow up (cut points >−2 kg/5 years;
   >2 kg/5 years) and dietary patterns ("Western" vs. "Healthy" patterns
   [27]). Because of previously observed negative associations, we studied
   interactions between estimated dietary dioxin exposure and smoking
   status, and breastfeeding [28,29] while interaction between estimated
   dietary dioxin exposure and alcohol consumption was studied due to
   potential positive association [30]. All tests for interaction were
   derived from the likelihood-ratio test comparing the models with and
   without an interaction term. Sensitivity analysis was performed,
   excluding breast cancer cases diagnosed less than 2 years after
   completing the E3N DHQ, to eliminate possible preclinical tumors. All
   P-values were two-sided and the significance level was set at 0.05. We
   used the SAS statistical software version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc.,
   Cary, NC, USA) for data analysis.

Results

   We analyzed data from 63,830 women with a median follow up of
   14.9 years, corresponding to 888,505 person-years and during which
   3,465 incident invasive breast cancers occurred. The food groups most
   consumed were fruit and vegetables (mean ± SD: 724.8 ± 288.5 g/d),
   dairy products (341.0 ± 200.1 g/d) and cereal products (247.7 ±
   108.8 g/d, Table 1). Fish and seafood were less frequently consumed
   (38.0 ± 27.2 g/d). The average level of dietary dioxin exposure was
   estimated at 1.3 ± 0.4 pg TEQ/kg BW/d (range: 0.1 to 5.7 pg TEQ/kg
   BW/d) and 2.7% of women exceeded the 2.3 pg TEQ/kg BW/d toxicity
   threshold established by the WHO [24,25]. The highest contributors to
   the total estimated dietary dioxin exposure were dairy products
   (33.3%), fruit and vegetables (22.1%), meat (18.8%) and fish and
   seafood (15.6%), while the contribution from eggs (5.5%), cereal
   products (3.6%) and added fats (1.2%) was low.

   Higher estimated dietary dioxin exposure was seen in younger women and
   in those with higher energy intake, higher alcohol consumption, lower
   pre- and postmenopausal BMI, and in women with 1 or 2 children before
   30 years, with a personal history of benign breast disease and those
   who had breastfed at least one of their children (Table 2).

   Table 3 shows HRs associated with estimated dietary dioxin exposure
   among overall participants and according to hormone receptor status
   (ER/PR). An increase of 0.43 pg TEQ/kg BW/d in the intake of dioxins
   was not associated with risk of invasive breast cancer risk among
   overall participants, neither in the univariable nor in the
   multivariable models: HR = 1.01 (0.99, 1.03) and HR = 1.00 (0.96,
   1.05), respectively. There was no statistically significant linear
   trend between quartiles of estimated dietary dioxin exposure and breast
   cancer risk (P for trend = 0.9405). There was also no association
   between estimated dietary dioxin exposure and ER+/PR+ or ER+/PR- breast
   cancer risk. However a borderline statistically significant decrease in
   ER-/PR- breast cancer risk was observed across quartiles of estimated
   dietary dioxin exposure (HR for Q1 vs. Q4: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.50, 1.02; P
   for trend across quartiles = 0.0629). When stratifying by menopausal
   status, we observed a statistically significant decrease in ER-/PR-
   breast cancer risk (HR for Q4 vs. Q1: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.45, 0.96; P for
   trend across quartiles = 0.0463) (Table 4).

   Adjusting for fruit and vegetable consumption, total dietary flavonoid
   intake, or any other food groups, did not change the results (data not
   shown). There was no significant interaction between BMI and estimated
   dietary dioxin exposure among pre- and postmenopausal women in relation
   to invasive breast cancer risk. There was no effect modification by
   smoking, alcohol consumption, dietary patterns, gain or loss of weight
   during follow up and breastfeeding, and there was no association
   between estimated dietary dioxin exposure and breast cancer risk in any
   above-defined subgroups (Additional file 1: Table S2). Our results did
   not change when excluding breast cancer cases diagnosed less than
   2 years after inclusion (data not shown).

Discussion

   To our knowledge, this study is the first to assess breast cancer risk
   associated with dietary dioxin exposure. Among women from the E3N
   prospective cohort, we did not observe any increase of breast cancer
   risk associated with estimated dietary dioxin exposure. Among
   postmenopausal women, an inverse association was observed between
   estimated dioxin intake and ER-/PR- breast cancer risk.

   Our estimation of an average dioxin intake of 1.3 pg TEQ/kg BW/d is of
   the same order of magnitude or lower than in other studies. In a
   monitoring program conducted in 1996 to 1998 in the general French
   population and using the same dioxin contamination data as in our
   study, mean dietary dioxin exposure was also estimated at 1.3 pg TEQ/kg
   BW/d [21]. At the same period in Europe, estimated dietary dioxin
   exposure of the general population varied between 1.0 pg TEQ/kg BW/d
   (Germany) and 3.5 pg TEQ/kg BW/d (Spain) [31-34]. In the US, dietary
   dioxin exposure was estimated between 0.3 and 3.2 pg TEQ/kg BW/d [35].
   Dairy products and seafood were consistently identified across studies
   as being the main food contributors to dioxin exposure [21,32,34].
   However, because food contribution depends on dietary habits, some
   studies (including ours) showed an additional important contribution of
   cereal products and fruit and vegetables [31]. These foods, although
   little contaminated by dioxins, are highly consumed by some
   populations, and their contribution to overall dioxin intake must thus
   be considered. However, most previous studies focused on dioxin intake
   from foods known to be the most contaminated by dioxins and did not
   consider dioxin intake from consumption of foods from vegetal origin.
   This is likely to result in an underestimation of the intake of
   dioxins, as concluded in a validation study of a dietary questionnaire
   developed for the assessment of dietary dioxin exposure [36].

   Previous studies investigating the association between breast cancer
   and dioxin exposure (environmental, accidental and occupational) mostly
   reported a weak increase in the risk of breast cancer [9,14] or the
   mortality rates of breast cancer [11-13]. Our results are not
   consistent with those studies, probably because they have focused on
   populations exposed accidentally, occupationally or living near
   emitting sources of dioxins, that is, exposed to high levels of
   dioxins, whereas our study population was exposed to low levels of
   dioxins. Moreover, among the Seveso Women's Health Study (SWHS) [9],
   the results were obtained for a different exposure window than women
   from the E3N study, as the SWHS women were aged 0 to 40 at the time of
   exposure (1976) whereas in 1993, almost half of the women of our study
   population were postmenopausal.

   Our results suggest that exposure to dioxins in the low range observed
   in our study may be associated with a decreased risk of
   hormone-independent (ER-/PR-) breast cancer, especially after
   menopause. Inverse associations between endocrine disrupting chemicals
   and ER- breast cancer risk have been found previously. Raaschou-Nielsen
   et al. found a lower risk associated with higher adipose tissue
   concentrations of dioxin-like organochlorines in postmenopausal women
   [37]. Gammon et al. observed a lower risk of ER-/PR- breast cancer in
   women with serum levels of PCBs in the highest tertile compared to the
   lowest [38]. Some studies investigating breast cancer risk in relation
   to dioxin exposure also suggested a decreased breast cancer risk. A
   French registry-based case-control study conducted near a MSWI showed a
   decreased risk of invasive breast cancer among women aged over 60 years
   and highly exposed, compared to non-exposed women, although these
   results could be explained by confounding, because there was no
   adjustment on breast cancer risk factors or other potential confounders
   other than age and place of residence [15]. A small decrease in breast
   cancer risk was also observed among women exposed during the Seveso
   accident and followed between 1977 and 1986, although not statistically
   significant [7]. However, the authors of these studies did not stratify
   on tumor hormone receptor status. Our findings may also be supported by
   experimental evidence on the role of dioxins in promotion or inhibition
   of mammary tumor formation. TCDD has been shown to operate in animals
   and humans through binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR, [5]).
   Some studies have described an antiproliferative action of TCDD in ER-
   breast cancer cell lines through AhR-dependent [39,40] or
   AhR-independent pathways [41]. These observations were complemented by
   animal studies demonstrating that TCDD inhibits the proliferation of
   cells from the mammary gland and mammary tumor formation [42,43]. In a
   recent review of the literature on the role of AhR in carcinogenesis,
   Safe et al. highlighted the fact that the effect of TCDD may vary
   according to the target organ as well as windows of exposure [44]. For
   example, animal studies have demonstrated that prenatal TCDD exposure
   increased susceptibility to carcinogen-induced mammary tumor formation,
   while exposure during pregnancy delayed mammary tumor formation. Women
   of our study population were on average aged 57.2 ± 6.6 years old at
   inclusion in 1993. Therefore, we were not able to investigate the
   association of breast cancer risk with estimated dietary dioxin
   exposure during other windows of exposure such as prenatal periods or
   pregnancy.

Strengths and limitations

   Strengths of our study include the prospective design, the large size
   of the study population and number of breast cancer cases, a long
   follow-up that provides a large latency period for potential cancer
   occurrence, adjustment for most known breast cancer risk factors
   updated throughout follow-up, and validated dietary data. The
   participation rate which is still high 18 years after the start of the
   E3N study (≥75% at each follow-up questionnaire) and the low percentage
   of missing data attests of the quality of the information collected.
   Because our statistical models were adjusted for several individual
   breast cancer risk factors, it is unlikely that residual confounding
   changes our risk estimates. Moreover, we analyzed the potential
   confounding effect of flavonoid intake. Flavonoids are dietary
   phytochemicals that have been suggested to protect against dioxin
   toxicity [45] and to play a role in breast cancer prevention [46,47];
   adjustment for total dietary flavonoid intake did not change our
   results.

   Nevertheless, our study has some limitations. First, to determine
   dietary dioxin exposure, we used consumption data obtained through a
   semi-quantitative diet history questionnaire. DHQ are often used for
   their applicability to a large number of participants. However, as DHQ
   are self-administered questionnaires on habitual food consumption over
   the past 12 months, we cannot exclude some inaccuracy of consumption
   data and a non-differential bias due to the desire of conformity to
   social norms. Nevertheless, the potential lack of precision has been
   minimized by the collection of food frequency for each food item and
   the estimation of portion sizes through a photo-booklet. Moreover, both
   the dietary questionnaire and photo-booklet have been validated
   [18,19].

   Second, the food contamination data by dioxins came from the first
   French national monitoring program, which aimed to assess dioxin levels
   of foods sampled between 1996 and 1998 [21]. Because the authors did
   not achieve an exhaustive sampling plan, the data may not be
   representative of the dioxin contamination of food in France for that
   period. However, because of the large number of samples (n = 444), the
   coverage of all major food contributors of dioxin intake and the fact
   that those data were the closest to the period of the E3N DHQ
   administration, we can assume that they accurately reflect the
   contamination of food in 1993. We combined the consumption data with
   the contamination data using standardized formulas recommended by the
   WHO [22]. However, for some food items of the E3N DHQ, no contamination
   data were reported in the CSHPF study; therefore we assigned to each of
   these items the average contamination of the food group to which it
   belonged (see Additional file 1: Table S1 for an example).

   Also, we could not consider the source of the food consumed, that is,
   women living and consuming food produced near a dioxin emitting source
   may consume foods more contaminated than average. This could have led
   to an underestimation of the exposure for those women and to
   misclassification bias, although non differential so the risk would be
   potentially drawn toward 1. The estimated dietary dioxin exposure may
   not reflect the total exposure to dioxins of the E3N women. We cannot
   eliminate the contribution of exposure from environmental sources, even
   if its contribution remains probably minor compared to that of food. In
   contrast, because most women from the E3N cohort are teachers or from
   affiliated occupations, we can assume the occupational dioxin exposure
   to be negligible and homogeneous among study participants.

   Our estimation of the dietary dioxin exposure cannot be extrapolated to
   the French general population. Indeed, the intake of dioxins through
   the diet depends on the relative intake of foods of high or low levels
   of dioxin contamination and their quantity consumed (for instance, our
   population has a higher consumption of fruit and vegetables than
   generally observed). Moreover, we can expect a healthy participation
   effect in our cohort, as it is composed of volunteers with a high level
   of education and health consciousness. This could result in a possible
   underrepresentation of high fat (so high dioxin) consumptions; however
   this should not have biased our results.

Conclusion

   Among women from the E3N prospective cohort, estimated dietary dioxin
   exposure was not associated with breast cancer risk. Further studies
   should include both dietary and non-dietary (environmental) exposures
   as well as different windows of exposure (prenatal, pregnancy periods)
   in order to further investigate the complex association between
   low-dose dioxin exposure and hormone receptor-defined breast cancer
   risk.

Abstract

   Alcohol drinking and, to a lesser extent, cigarette smoking are risk
   factors for a first primary breast cancer. Information on these
   behaviours at diagnosis may contribute to risk prediction of
   contralateral breast cancer (CBC) and they are potentially modifiable.
   The WECARE Study is a large population-based case-control study of
   women with breast cancer where cases (N = 1,521) had asynchronous CBC
   and controls (N = 2,212), matched on survival time and other factors,
   had unilateral breast cancer (UBC). Using multivariable conditional
   logistic regression to estimate rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence
   intervals (CI), we examined the risk of CBC in relation to drinking and
   smoking history at and following first diagnosis. We adjusted for
   treatment, disease characteristics and other factors. There was some
   evidence for an association between CBC risk and current drinking or
   current smoking at the time of first breast cancer diagnosis, but the
   increased risk occurred primarily among women exposed to both
   (RR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.24-2.11). CBC risk was also elevated in women who
   both smoked and drank alcohol after diagnosis (RR = 1.54, 95% CI
   1.18-1.99). In the subset of women with detailed information on amount
   consumed, smoking an average of ≥10 cigarettes per day following
   diagnosis was also associated with increased CBC risk (RR = 1.50, 95%
   CI 1.08-2.08; p-trend = 0.03). Among women with a diagnosis of breast
   cancer, information on current drinking and smoking could contribute to
   the prediction of CBC risk. Women who both drink and smoke may
   represent a group who merit targeted lifestyle intervention to modify
   their risk of CBC.

Abstract

   Disposal of used tires has been a major problem in solid waste
   management. New uses will have to be found to consume recycled tire
   products. One such proposed use is as ground cover in playgrounds.
   However, concern has been expressed regarding exposure of children to
   hazardous chemicals and the environmental impact of such chemicals. We
   designed a comprehensive hazard assessment to evaluate and address
   potential human health and environmental concerns associated with the
   use of tire crumb in playgrounds. Human health concerns were addressed
   using conventional hazard analyses, mutagenicity assays, and aquatic
   toxicity tests of extracted tire crumb. Hazard to children appears to
   be minimal. Toxicity to all aquatic organisms (bacteria, invertebrates,
   fish, and green algae) was observed; however, this activity disappeared
   with aging of the tire crumb for three months in place in the
   playground. We conclude that the use of tire crumb in playgrounds
   results in minimal hazard to children and the receiving environment.

The Cognitive Benefits of Being Bilingual

   Viorica Marian, Ph.D. and Anthony Shook
   Author information Copyright and License information Disclaimer
   Viorica Marian, Ph.D., is chair of the department of communication
   sciences and disorders at Northwestern University and associate
   professor of communication sciences and disorders, psychology, and
   cognitive science. Dr. Marian received a Ph.D. from Cornell University
   and a master’s degree from Emory University. Her research focuses on
   bilingualism/multilingualism and the brain’s ability to accommodate
   multiple languages at the same time, with a specific emphasis on
   language processing, language and memory, and language learning. Dr.
   Marian directs the Bilingualism and Psycholinguistics Laboratory and
   uses cognitive, behavioral, and neurological measures to study human
   language capacity and the consequences of bilingualism for linguistic,
   cognitive, and neural function.
   Anthony Shook is a doctoral candidate in the department of
   communication sciences and disorders at Northwestern University. His
   research investigates bilingualism and what it can reveal about
   language, with a focus on how two or more languages interact at
   multiple levels of processing and the effect of this interaction on the
   language system. Mr. Shook uses behavioral and neurological methods, as
   well as computational modeling, to explore the form and architecture of
   the bilingual language comprehension system.

Editor’s note:

   Today, more of the world’s population is bilingual or multilingual than
   monolingual. In addition to facilitating cross-cultural communication,
   this trend also positively affects cognitive abilities. Researchers
   have shown that the bilingual brain can have better attention and
   task-switching capacities than the monolingual brain, thanks to its
   developed ability to inhibit one language while using another. In
   addition, bilingualism has positive effects at both ends of the age
   spectrum: Bilingual children as young as seven months can better adjust
   to environmental changes, while bilingual seniors can experience less
   cognitive decline.

   We are surrounded by language during nearly every waking moment of our
   lives. We use language to communicate our thoughts and feelings, to
   connect with others and identify with our culture, and to understand
   the world around us. And for many people, this rich linguistic
   environment involves not just one language but two or more. In fact,
   the majority of the world’s population is bilingual or multilingual. In
   a survey conducted by the European Commission in 2006, 56 percent of
   respondents reported being able to speak in a language other than their
   mother tongue. In many countries that percentage is even higher—for
   instance, 99 percent of Luxembourgers and 95 percent of Latvians speak
   more than one language.1 Even in the United States, which is widely
   considered to be monolingual, one-fifth of those over the age of five
   reported speaking a language other than English at home in 2007, an
   increase of 140 percent since 1980.2 Millions of Americans use a
   language other than English in their everyday lives outside of the
   home, when they are at work or in the classroom. Europe and the United
   States are not alone, either. The Associated Press reports that up to
   66 percent of the world’s children are raised bilingual.3 Over the past
   few decades, technological advances have allowed researchers to peer
   deeper into the brain to investigate how bilingualism interacts with
   and changes the cognitive and neurological systems.

Cognitive Consequences of Bilingualism

   Research has overwhelmingly shown that when a bilingual person uses one
   language, the other is active at the same time. When a person hears a
   word, he or she doesn’t hear the entire word all at once: the sounds
   arrive in sequential order. Long before the word is finished, the
   brain’s language system begins to guess what that word might be by
   activating lots of words that match the signal. If you hear “can,” you
   will likely activate words like “candy” and “candle” as well, at least
   during the earlier stages of word recognition. For bilingual people,
   this activation is not limited to a single language; auditory input
   activates corresponding words regardless of the language to which they
   belong.4

   Some of the most compelling evidence for language co-activation comes
   from studying eye movements. We tend to look at things that we are
   thinking, talking, or hearing about.5 A Russian-English bilingual
   person asked to “pick up a marker” from a set of objects would look
   more at a stamp than someone who doesn’t know Russian, because the
   Russian word for “stamp,” “marka,” sounds like the English word he or
   she heard, “marker.”4 In cases like this, language co-activation occurs
   because what the listener hears could map onto words in either
   language. Furthermore, language co-activation is so automatic that
   people consider words in both languages even without overt similarity.
   For example, when Chinese-English bilingual people judge how alike two
   English words are in meaning, their brain responses are affected by
   whether or not the Chinese translations of those words are written
   similarly.6 Even though the task does not require the bilingual people
   to engage their Chinese, they do so anyway.

   Having to deal with this persistent linguistic competition can result
   in language difficulties. For instance, knowing more than one language
   can cause speakers to name pictures more slowly7 and can increase
   tip-of-the-tongue states (where you’re unable to fully conjure a word,
   but can remember specific details about it, like what letter it starts
   with).8 As a result, the constant juggling of two languages creates a
   need to control how much a person accesses a language at any given
   time. From a communicative standpoint, this is an important
   skill—understanding a message in one language can be difficult if your
   other language always interferes. Likewise, if a bilingual person
   frequently switches between languages when speaking, it can confuse the
   listener, especially if that listener knows only one of the speaker’s
   languages.

   To maintain the relative balance between two languages, the bilingual
   brain relies on executive functions, a regulatory system of general
   cognitive abilities that includes processes such as attention and
   inhibition. Because both of a bilingual person’s language systems are
   always active and competing, that person uses these control mechanisms
   every time she or he speaks or listens. This constant practice
   strengthens the control mechanisms and changes the associated brain
   regions.9–12

   Bilingual people often perform better on tasks that require conflict
   management. In the classic Stroop task, people see a word and are asked
   to name the color of the word’s font. When the color and the word match
   (i.e., the word “red” printed in red), people correctly name the color
   more quickly than when the color and the word don’t match (i.e., the
   word “red” printed in blue). This occurs because the word itself
   (“red”) and its font color (blue) conflict. The cognitive system must
   employ additional resources to ignore the irrelevant word and focus on
   the relevant color. The ability to ignore competing perceptual
   information and focus on the relevant aspects of the input is called
   inhibitory control. Bilingual people often perform better than
   monolingual people at tasks that tap into inhibitory control ability.
   Bilingual people are also better than monolingual people at switching
   between two tasks; for example, when bilinguals have to switch from
   categorizing objects by color (red or green) to categorizing them by
   shape (circle or triangle), they do so more rapidly than monolingual
   people,13 reflecting better cognitive control when changing strategies
   on the fly.

Changes in Neurological Processing and Structure

   Studies suggest that bilingual advantages in executive function are not
   limited to the brain’s language networks.9 Researchers have used brain
   imaging techniques like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
   investigate which brain regions are active when bilingual people
   perform tasks in which they are forced to alternate between their two
   languages. For instance, when bilingual people have to switch between
   naming pictures in Spanish and naming them in English, they show
   increased activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a
   brain region associated with cognitive skills like attention and
   inhibition.14 Along with the DLPFC, language switching has been found
   to involve such structures as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC),
   bilateral supermarginal gyri, and left inferior frontal gyrus
   (left-IFG), regions that are also involved in cognitive control.9 The
   left-IFG in particular, often considered the language production center
   of the brain, appears to be involved in both linguistic15 and
   non-linguistic cognitive control.16

   The neurological roots of the bilingual advantage extend to subcortical
   brain areas more traditionally associated with sensory processing. When
   monolingual and bilingual adolescents listen to simple speech sounds
   (e.g., the syllable “da”) without any intervening background noise,
   they show highly similar brain stem responses to the auditory
   information. When researchers play the same sound to both groups in the
   presence of background noise, the bilingual listeners’ neural response
   is considerably larger, reflecting better encoding of the sound’s
   fundamental frequency,17 a feature of sound closely related to pitch
   perception. To put it another way, in bilingual people, blood flow (a
   marker for neuronal activity) is greater in the brain stem in response
   to the sound. Intriguingly, this boost in sound encoding appears to be
   related to advantages in auditory attention. The cognitive control
   required to manage multiple languages appears to have broad effects on
   neurological function, fine-tuning both cognitive control mechanisms
   and sensory processes.

   Beyond differences in neuronal activation, bilingualism seems to affect
   the brain’s structure as well. Higher proficiency in a second language,
   as well as earlier acquisition of that language, correlates with higher
   gray matter volume in the left inferior parietal cortex.18 Researchers
   have associated damage to this area with uncontrolled language
   switching,19 suggesting that it may play an important role in managing
   the balance between two languages. Likewise, researchers have found
   white matter volume changes in bilingual children20 and older adults.21
   It appears that bilingual experience not only changes the way
   neurological structures process information, but also may alter the
   neurological structures themselves.

Improvements in Learning

   Being bilingual can have tangible practical benefits. The improvements
   in cognitive and sensory processing driven by bilingual experience may
   help a bilingual person to better process information in the
   environment, leading to a clearer signal for learning. This kind of
   improved attention to detail may help explain why bilingual adults
   learn a third language better than monolingual adults learn a second
   language.22 The bilingual language-learning advantage may be rooted in
   the ability to focus on information about the new language while
   reducing interference from the languages they already know.23 This
   ability would allow bilingual people to more easily access newly
   learned words, leading to larger gains in vocabulary than those
   experienced by monolingual people who aren’t as skilled at inhibiting
   competing information.

   Furthermore, the benefits associated with bilingual experience seem to
   start quite early—researchers have shown bilingualism to positively
   influence attention and conflict management in infants as young as
   seven months. In one study, researchers taught babies growing up in
   monolingual or bilingual homes that when they heard a tinkling sound, a
   puppet appeared on one side of a screen. Halfway through the study, the
   puppet began appearing on the opposite side of the screen. In order to
   get a reward, the infants had to adjust the rule they’d learned; only
   the bilingual babies were able to successfully learn the new rule.24
   This suggests that even for very young children, navigating a
   multilingual environment imparts advantages that transfer beyond
   language.

Protecting Against Age-Related Decline

   The cognitive and neurological benefits of bilingualism also extend
   into older adulthood. Bilingualism appears to provide a means of
   fending off a natural decline of cognitive function and maintaining
   what is called “cognitive reserve.”9, 25 Cognitive reserve refers to
   the efficient utilization of brain networks to enhance brain function
   during aging. Bilingual experience may contribute to this reserve by
   keeping the cognitive mechanisms sharp and helping to recruit alternate
   brain networks to compensate for those that become damaged during
   aging. Older bilingual people enjoy improved memory26 and executive
   control9 relative to older monolingual people, which can lead to
   real-world health benefits.

   In addition to staving off the decline that often comes with aging,
   bilingualism can also protect against illnesses that hasten this
   decline, like Alzheimer’s disease. In a study of more than 200
   bilingual and monolingual patients with Alzheimer’s disease, bilingual
   patients reported showing initial symptoms of the disease at about 77.7
   years of age—5.1 years later than the monolingual average of 72.6.
   Likewise, bilingual patients were diagnosed 4.3 years later than the
   monolingual patients (80.8 years of age and 76.5 years of age,
   respectively).25 In a follow-up study, researchers compared the brains
   of bilingual and monolingual patients matched on the severity of
   Alzheimer’s symptoms. Surprisingly, the brains of bilingual people
   showed a significantly higher degree of physical atrophy in regions
   commonly associated with Alzheimer’s disease.27 In other words, the
   bilingual people had more physical signs of disease than their
   monolingual counterparts, yet performed on par behaviorally, even
   though their degree of brain atrophy suggested that their symptoms
   should be much worse. If the brain is an engine, bilingualism may help
   to improve its mileage, allowing it to go farther on the same amount of
   fuel.

Conclusion

   The cognitive and neurological benefits of bilingualism extend from
   early childhood to old age as the brain more efficiently processes
   information and staves off cognitive decline. What’s more, the
   attention and aging benefits discussed above aren’t exclusive to people
   who were raised bilingual; they are also seen in people who learn a
   second language later in life.25, 28 The enriched cognitive control
   that comes along with bilingual experience represents just one of the
   advantages that bilingual people enjoy. Despite certain linguistic
   limitations that have been observed in bilinguals (e.g., increased
   naming difficulty7), bilingualism has been associated with improved
   metalinguistic awareness (the ability to recognize language as a system
   that can be manipulated and explored), as well as with better memory,
   visual-spatial skills, and even creativity.29 Furthermore, beyond these
   cognitive and neurological advantages, there are also valuable social
   benefits that come from being bilingual, among them the ability to
   explore a culture through its native tongue or talk to someone with
   whom you might otherwise never be able to communicate. The cognitive,
   neural, and social advantages observed in bilingual people highlight
   the need to consider how bilingualism shapes the activity and the
   architecture of the brain, and ultimately how language is represented
   in the human mind, especially since the majority of speakers in the
   world experience life through more than one language.

Abstract

   Geneticists study the gene; however, for epigeneticists, there is no
   obvious 'epigene'. Nevertheless, during the past year, more than 2,500
   articles, numerous scientific meetings and a new journal were devoted
   to the subject of epigenetics. It encompasses some of the most exciting
   contemporary biology and is portrayed by the popular press as a
   revolutionary new science--an antidote to the idea that we are
   hard-wired by our genes. So what is epigenetics?

Abstract

   The genetic code cannot alone explain the diversity of cellular and
   individual phenotypes. Epigenetics provides an additional level of
   information that is not encoded in the DNA molecule but nonetheless
   influences its activity in a stable and heritable manner through cell
   divisions. This effect on gene expression results from variations in
   chromatin states and is induced by biochemical modifications targeting
   the DNA molecule or associated histone proteins. Epigenetic regulation
   can convert a developmental or transient environmental signal into a
   stable transcriptional response, which will then be perpetuated even in
   the absence of the original stimulus. Epigenetic regulation explains
   how, starting from a unique genome, the pluripotent embryo can generate
   a variety of tissues and maintain their identity throughout
   development. Epigenetics has a broad impact on development, by
   controlling pluripotent and differentiated states. An increasing number
   of pathological situations are being attributed to abnormal
   establishment or maintenance of epigenetic patterns. Given the mitotic
   heritability of epigenetic states, a key question is whether epigenetic
   information can also be transmitted through generations.

Abstract

   Epigenetic aberrations have been associated with cutaneous melanoma
   tumorigenesis and progression including dysregulated DNA gene promoter
   region methylation, histone modification, and microRNA. Several of
   these major epigenetic aberrations have been developed into biomarkers.
   Epigenetic biomarkers can be detected in tissue and in blood as
   circulating DNA in melanoma patients. There is strong evidence that
   biomarkers in cutaneous melanoma will have an important role as
   companions to therapeutics and overall patient management. Important
   progress has been made in epigenetic melanoma biomarker development and
   verification of clinical utility, and this review discusses some of the
   key current developments and existing challenges.

Abstract

   Remarkable progress in the field of epigenetics has turned academic,
   medical and public attention to the potential applications of these new
   advances in medicine and various fields of biomedical research. The
   result is a broader appreciation of epigenetic phenomena in the a
   etiology of common human diseases, most notably cancer. These advances
   also represent an exciting opportunity to incorporate epigenetics and
   epigenomics into carcinogen identification and safety assessment.
   Current epigenetic studies, including major international sequencing
   projects, are expected to generate information for establishing the
   'normal' epigenome of tissues and cell types as well as the
   physiological variability of the epigenome against which carcinogen
   exposure can be assessed. Recently, epigenetic events have emerged as
   key mechanisms in cancer development, and while our search of the
   Monograph Volume 100 revealed that epigenetics have played a modest
   role in evaluating human carcinogens by the International Agency for
   Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs so far, epigenetic data might play
   a pivotal role in the future. Here, we review (i) the current status of
   incorporation of epigenetics in carcinogen evaluation in the IARC
   Monographs Programme, (ii) potential modes of action for epigenetic
   carcinogens, (iii) current in vivo and in vitro technologies to detect
   epigenetic carcinogens, (iv) genomic regions and epigenetic
   modifications and their biological consequences and (v) critical
   technological and biological issues in assessment of epigenetic
   carcinogens. We also discuss the issues related to opportunities and
   challenges in the application of epigenetic testing in carcinogen
   identification and evaluation. Although the application of epigenetic
   assays in carcinogen evaluation is still in its infancy, important data
   are being generated and valuable scientific resources are being
   established that should catalyse future applications of epigenetic
   testing.

   Epigenetic mechanisms regulate key cellular processes (such as gene
   transcription, DNA repair and differentiation) and play critical roles
   in cellular responses to environmental exposures and endogenous
   stimuli. Deregulation of epigenetic mechanisms may promote the
   development of abnormal phenotypes and cancer. There is a crosstalk
   between epigenetic and genetic changes in the process of cancer
   development and progression. Given that epigenetic and genetic changes
   coexist in all cancers, it is often unclear what are the primary and
   secondary events pertinent to carcinogenesis.

   Testing the effects of maternal diet on the phenotype of the offspring
   using the Avy/a mouse model. (A) The effect of dietary supplementation
   of female mice before or after mating with male Avy/a agouti mice can
   be tested. (B) The effect of maternal dietary supplementation on the
   epigenome can be ‘read’ by coat-colour distribution in Avy/a offspring.
   (C) The effect of DNA methylation at the intracisternal A particle
   (IAP) on agouti gene expression. Maternal dietary supplementation may
   shift the coat-colour distribution of the offspring. This shift is a
   result of change in methylation at IAP element upstream of the agouti
   gene. Adapted from ref. ().
