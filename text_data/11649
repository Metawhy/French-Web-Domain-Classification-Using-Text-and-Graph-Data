Welcome to the University of Buea.

   If you have just discovered University of Buea, I’d like to take this
   opportunity to extend a warm welcome and tell you a bit about why we
   are called a place to be.

   Our university located in the historic town of Buea on the eastern
   flank of Mount Cameroon, is the only English-speaking institution of
   its kind in predominantly French-speaking Central Africa. It can easily
   be reached by an all-season, asphalted highway from the port city of
   Limbe, and some 30 km to the West, or from the Douala International
   airport that lies 70 km to the East. We offer a rich portfolio of about
   degree programmes at the Bachelor’s, Master’s and PhD levels, all of
   them designed to comply with the European Bologna BMP-System. Our
   degree programmes continue to attract thousands of applications from
   within and abroad.
