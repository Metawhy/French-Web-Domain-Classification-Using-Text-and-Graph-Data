Malik Yoba Storms Off Set After Being Pressed on Allegations of Soliciting
Sex From a Minor

   Actor Malik Yoba stormed off the set during an on-camera interview with
   The Root Friday after being asked about allegations that he solicited
   sex from a minor who engaged in survival sex work in the late 1990s and
   early 2000s. The walkout was also seemingly triggered by questions
   about his motives for publishing an Instagram post that declared his
   love and attraction for trans women, which has since been deleted.

   During the conversation at The Root’s studios, The Root asked Yoba to
   respond to a Facebook post by Mariah Lopez Ebony, in which she accuses
   the actor of soliciting sex from her at ages 13 and 16. Yoba said, “I
   don’t know the woman,” and “I have no idea who she is.” In a phone
   interview with The Root on Saturday, Lopez, now 34, stood by her
   claims, saying her first sex act with Yoba took place at age 13, and
   the second act occurred at age 16.

   Lopez was born April 27, 1985, so the first sexual act would have
   likely taken place in 1998 and the second act in 2001. Lopez is a
   long-time trans rights activist and executive director of STARR, the
   Strategic Trans Alliance for Radical Reform, founded by trans pioneers
   Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson. Lopez alleges Yoba, now 52, would
   drive around New York’s Greenwich Village area looking for trans women
   to pay for sex.

   Here is an excerpt from Lopez’s Facebook post:

     I started seeing him personally, with my own two eyes, cruising
     around the meatpacking district and Village, large black Jeep,
     looking for Trans fem sex workers, he preferred black trans girls;
     pretty, slim girls, but would pick up a latinx if she was put
     together and/or looked mixed.

     That was close to 20 years ago, and I can still remember it like
     yesterday. i also remember the day a friend of mine said, real cool,
     like she was known to do “.......walk down that block..Just go! He
     wants You.....”. You always remember celebrity clients. It’s like
     time slows down. You remember every detail, Blood pounding. He was
     cute, and polite, don’t get me wrong. But I’m sure he knew what he
     was doing, was Wrong.....

   The first time Lopez claims she had sex with Yoba for pay took place in
   1998 in either the West Village or the Meatpacking District, when an
   adult sex worker escorted her to Yoba’s “larger black SUV or jeep” that
   may have been a Ford Explorer or Excursion. Lopez says the woman who
   took her to Yoba’s vehicle is unwilling to speak publicly for fear of
   legal reprisals for her involvement in the transaction between Yoba and
   Lopez, and that the woman has secured legal counsel. Once Lopez entered
   the car, Yoba handed her $80 for sex. She declined to go into details
   of exactly what took place.

   “I will say, that based on my personal experience in the instance
   you’re inquiring about but also my further knowledge of him personally,
   he has a proclivity for sexual intercourse that is homoerotic,” says
   Lopez.

   Lopez also noted that Yoba wanted to engage in the sex act without
   protection. She further recounts that she normally charged “a bill,” or
   $100, for the act, but that Yoba only had $80 at the time of the
   encounter.

   During the second meeting, Lopez said Yoba parked in the Greenwich
   Village area where she was working, turned off his lights, and stared
   at her, which she says is a common way for clients to pick up sex
   workers. Lopez walked by his car and he told her to get in, she said.

   “When I got in the car and he recognized who I was, he was slightly
   annoyed because I am not necessarily a ‘good ho,’” one who would let
   him dictate the terms of the encounter unchallenged.

   Yoba insisted on picking the route to the location where the act would
   take place, Lopez said. “Sometimes you go in the car and you direct the
   client where to go,” she said. “Not only was he a veteran-ass trick, so
   it was not surprising that he wanted to choose the route; but also just
   being a celebrity, you let them drive always, [and] he had a very
   specific route, a circle of comfort, a zone.”

   Lopez said they ended up in a Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood park, where
   they engaged in a sexual act for pay. Yoba tried to not use protection,
   but Lopez was able to convince him otherwise, she says.

   Another black trans woman, Ja’nese Bussey, who performed sex work with
   Lopez during the late 1990s and early 2000s, told The Root in a
   separate phone interview Saturday that Lopez told her she performed sex
   acts with Yoba for pay soon after the first act took place. Bussey
   confirmed Lopez was 13-years-old at the time. On two occasions, Bussey,
   who says she went by the name “Charisse” during her time as a sex
   worker, said Yoba gave her money in exchange for sex. He also asked her
   if she could find him “teenage girls” for sex, Bussey claims.

   Bussey, 40, said that there was no doubt that Lopez looked underage at
   the time the first alleged sex act with Yoba took place. “She looked
   10,” Bussey added.

   A representative for Yoba said in a statement to The Root that the
   actor “categorically denies all allegations and will not respond,
   beyond this comment, to requests for comment.”

   It is not uncommon for underage trans teens to enter survival sex work
   because their parents often kick them out because they refuse to accept
   their trans identity. Polaris Project finds that the average age of
   entry into sex work is 19-years-old, but that is a general figure that
   is not specific to trans sex workers. Diamond Collier, a board member
   of Black Transwomen Inc., says it is not uncommon for trans children to
   enter sex work at 13 years old and that she herself was faced with a
   choice of entering a group home or doing sex work after she
   transitioned as a teen.

   “In that moment, I was given that option to get into sex work or [go to
   the group home]. So there’s a lot of situations where girls have no
   other options,” said Collier, who also performed sex work, starting at
   age 23 until she was 28. “Trans girls, especially back in the day,
   couldn’t go to shelters that were for guys or girls. They didn’t have
   anywhere to go. And sometimes some of the LGBTQ shelters didn’t take
   you back in the day unless you were HIV-positive. So how the system is
   set up, it forces girls to get in that kind of work.”

   In Yoba’s on-camera interview with The Root, he gave this response to
   Mariah’s Facebook allegations:

   The Root [7:11]: Since creating these posts, you’ve received a mixture
   of support and criticisms. On a more serious note, a trans woman named
   Mariah Lopez Ebony wrote a Facebook post in which she accused you of
   soliciting sex from her as a minor when she was both 13 and 16 years
   old. What do you have to say to this allegation?
   Advertisement

   Yoba [7:34]: I say that, you know, when I heard that, and I actually
   didn’t read it until last Thursday, what she actually said, I don’t
   know the woman, number one…

   The Root [7:44]: So, you’re saying you never met her, you don’t know
   her?

   Yoba [7:47]: That’s exactly what I am saying. I don’t know her. I have
   no idea who she is. I am familiar with that pain, I’m familiar with
   that trauma. I’m familiar with people who are crying out for help. I’m
   familiar with the lack of regard for this population, which is, again,
   my point. So, when I heard it, for me, to hear something so heinous,
   right, number one, and to see someone post something with no proof of
   anything and to see the world embrace it, or a portion of the world
   embrace it, that toxicity, speaks exactly to the reason I do the work
   that I do.
   Advertisement

   So, it’s an oxymoron almost. It’s like wow, the first cis-gender man
   who stands up for the community and gets attacked by that community.
   But that’s true for anybody that’s ever stood up for oppressed people.
   It’s happened to Gandhi. It’s happened to Mandela. It’s happened to
   Marcus Garvey. It’s happened to Malcolm X. It’s happened to anyone who
   has said, ‘I am gonna stand up for these oppressed people.’ Think about
   who we are, right? There was a time we couldn’t drink from water
   fountains, we couldn’t sit on the bus. Think about how ridiculous that
   is. And so, for me, having a view of a community that I grew up with
   and seeing the suffering. The very thing that motivates me to help
   people out of it is something someone tried to accuse me of…

   When The Root tried to interject, Yoba interrupted.

   Yoba [9:11]: I wanna finish the point. So, the point is to be on the
   other side of that tells me that the work has to continue and the
   blessing will be greater because the truth will always outweigh a lie.
   Right? So the truth is people are suffering. The truth is there are
   kids in the street. Right? But the other truth is for my entire life, I
   am someone who has been working with young people since I was 16 years
   old, making sure that there are better pathways for other people, so,
   that’s a very loaded question for you to ask me that and we discussed
   that before.

   At this point in the interview, it was emphasized that Yoba and The
   Root had established an understanding during an initial Sept. 16
   conversation regarding the allegations between Yoba and senior reporter
   Terrell Jermaine Starr, as well as the negative perceptions of him in
   the trans community. A wider conversation about his activism and his
   upcoming projects were also discussed in that meeting with Yoba and his
   publicists, and it was stated that these issues would be discussed in
   the Sept. 20 interview.

   The interview took a turn when The Root asked Yoba if he worried people
   would perceive his answer to the assault allegations as centering
   himself.
   Advertisement

   Yoba [10:17]: Yeah, you know, um, this is a bullet wound. Right? We’re
   on 45th Street and Broadway. I got shot five blocks from here at the
   age of 15. Right? A quarter of an inch over I would have been paralyzed
   from the neck down. A half-inch over I’d be dead. So, since January 18,
   1983, I’ve never taken a second for granted to be alive. I can’t even
   count how many people who are no longer here I grew up with that I’ve
   known. Numbers? I don’t even know how many it is. Right? And so life is
   precious and each moment is precious. So for someone who has long
   understood the power of thought and the power of intention, the ability
   to manifest my life the way I’ve wanted to. I never had a job I didn’t
   want. I’ve never had to work just to make money. Every single thing
   I’ve done in my life, whether I was a bike messenger, you know, working
   with young people, making movies, TV, working in education, working
   with the criminal justice system, working environment, working with
   fathers. Any social issue, professional pursuit, every single thing
   I’ve done it’s because it’s an intention. And I followed the intention
   and I chased the purpose, right?

   And so, to stand up in the face of someone saying that you’re this when
   I know I am this, I also felt, Wow. That’s kinda how it feels like to
   be transgender [12:14]. Right? Can you imagine walking into the world,
   looking the way you and I do, but feeling inside that something is not
   lining up and you need to address that. The way you present in the
   world and you don’t look so good.
   Advertisement

   The Root [12:30]: I don’t think I could ever or anybody who is
   cisgender could ever place themselves in a trans person’s position.

   Yoba [12:37]: I think we can because I had to do it on New York
   Undercover. So, on New York Undercover, we did an episode where people
   were killing transgender people. So we actually had to dress and go
   into the world…
   Advertisement

   The Root [12:50]: That’s fiction, though. That’s not real life.

   Yoba [12:53]: Yeah, but you’re missing my point. You’re making your
   point. The point that I’m making is that you asked me what does it feel
   like to stand up in the face of this. And I’m telling you that if I am
   this and someone is calling me this, that is akin to a transgender
   woman being called a man.
   Advertisement

   The Root [13:14]: Do you really make that comparison?

   Yoba [13:17]: I do. You may not make it but I’m making the comparison
   because I sat in it. I know what it’s like for people to try and yell
   at me and tell me I’m gay, to tell me I’m a pedophile, to tell me what
   I’m not. And I have to stand up to that. And the only thing I can do is
   stand up with the truth. And, so, when you feel that pain, when you
   walk down the street and people are basically saying, ‘Fuck you’ and
   you still walk on your purpose, that’s empowering. As painful as it is,
   it’s also empowering. And so when I talk to my transgender friends and
   they have people tell them what they’re not and they’re telling you
   that they are, that’s painful for them too.
   Advertisement

   So if I am gonna be the person, the first one, to stand up and take the
   hits. I know what it feels like and I feel I have the right to say,
   yes, as I stand alongside you, I do understand your pain. Not on an
   intellectual level but on an experiential level. I was walking down the
   street the other and someone said ‘Happy Birthday, AIDS victim.’ They
   screamed that out of a window to me. I lost work because of this, just
   like trans people. I have people look at me sideways just like trans
   people. I have people calling me gay, just like trans people. So I have
   the right to tell you exactly how it feels if I choose to stand up with
   these folks that I love and appreciate and consider part of my
   humanity. And I can tell you what it feels like.

   The Root went on to ask Yoba about allegations from trans sex workers
   who claimed that he solicited sex from them. Yoba replied that he
   didn’t know what the reporter was talking about. When asked how he
   reacts to criticisms that he does not actually care for trans people
   and that he fetishizes trans women, Yoba became demonstrably upset.

   Yoba walked away from his chair, threw his microphone to the floor,
   yelled “fuck you” to this reporter and the production team and demanded
   that he be given the SD video cards that recorded the interview, which
   The Root’s producers refused to do.

   Witnesses to Yoba’s profanity-laced meltdown were two video producers
   for The Root, two people representing Yoba, his 18-year-old daughter,
   and The Root’s senior video producer. Yoba’s publicists and The Root’s
   video producers tried to calm him down, but Yoba continued cursing
   until he finally left the studio.

   Yoba is scheduled to co-host a workshop leading up to the Trans
   National Visibility March this Thursday amid criticisms that his
   presence and the allegation by Lopez will take up space that is
   supposed to be focused on trans people. Trans activists have expressed
   concerns to The Root that Yoba has not demonstrated adequate knowledge
   to speak on behalf of trans issues and that his public statements are
   designed to elevate himself at trans people’s expense.

   Collier says that she was very proud of Yoba when he published his
   Instagram post expressing his love for trans women and the need for
   more black men to follow his lead. But she is not familiar with any of
   his work in the trans community during her 20 years of national
   organizing.

   “Conversations around Malik Yoba have centered around his participation
   in consenting adult sex work,” Collier said. “In the community, he is
   known to be a client. He’s known to be a nice guy. He’s known to be
   somebody that fetishizes us. I haven’t heard anything bad. Mariah was
   the first story that was weird and bad.”

   In media interviews, Yoba has mentioned Tiq Milan, a black trans
   activist in New York City, as someone who he has spoken to about trans
   issues. Milan, who is a trans man, told The Root that he could not
   speak to Yoba’s activism in the trans community and that he has only
   known him for a month after reaching out to thank him for his Instagram
   post. Despite the negative perceptions Milan has heard about Yoba, he
   said it was important for the actor to speak out.

   “I think Malik’s story is important,” Milan said. “I also think that it
   is a part of a larger conversation about the culture of lovelessness
   around transgender people, the homicide rate of black transgender women
   and expanding our outlook and definitions of love, desire, and
   masculinity.”

   Many trans women have gone on social media to question Yoba’s sincerity
   and motives. Sharon L. Cooks, a transgender woman who works as a
   business consultant in Philadelphia, said in a Facebook video that
   Yoba’s recent statements of being attracted to trans women are a
   publicity stunt.
   Advertisement

   “Let’s be very clear on what’s going on here,” Cooks said in her video.
   “Where was Malik in the ’90s when it wasn’t so popular? Where was Malik
   Yoba when he was 26 and he was liking women of trans experience? Where
   was he?”

   In a statement to The Root, organizers of the Trans National Visibility
   March said that Yoba was not directly involved with the march, adding:

     “We do respect the fact that Malik Yoba stood out to support himself
     and men like him. There currently is not a visible platform for
     trans amorous men and the work that Malik Yoba is doing is
     necessary. However, we believe that our work should be
     intersectional and that includes bridging the gaps and making space
     for other identities to be visible. It is not our duty to create
     space for them at this time when we are creating a visible space for
     ourselves. As leaders, it is our duty to be intersectional in our
     work and not exclusionary. We have a duty to fight for the
     liberation of all people but we must first stand for ourselves and
     heal. This is why we march!”

   Still, Collier is concerned that the national attention Yoba has
   brought to the trans community may be doing more harm than good.

   “You have a community that is ravaged with ridicule,” said Collier, who
   is the creator and host of the podcast Marsha’s Plate. “You have people
   doing comedy specials ridiculing us on the public mainstage. You have
   people burning us up in cars. It is a community that is in desperation
   for somebody. And it can be anybody, somebody stepping up and proud of
   loving us, being friends with us, being an ally with us. We kind of
   automatically prop them up in a position of admiration, in a position
   of bravery, a position of gratitude. We appreciate them doing that.
   Advertisement

   “But the problem with that is a lot of people who want to be allies,
   who want to be partners with us in this activism work, don’t have the
   cultural competency to actually do the work in a way that is not
   harmful. So when I saw those videos and I saw what was happening on the
   (Breakfast Club interview), it seemed like [Yoba] and the host were not
   socially equipped to handle the level of conversation that’s needed to
   push the culture forward when it comes to black trans people, black
   trans love, and particularly black trans women. They don’t have the
   experience. He’s done work with his career. He’s done work around
   himself. But in regards to our particular community, he’s not doing
   work. I don’t believe that at all.”

   The Root editor Angela Bronner Helm contributed reporting to this

Animated Video Game Porn Could Be A Lot Sexier And Less Gross

   Editor’s Note - 5:25pm: This story, part of our regular coverage of the
   intersection of sex and games, originally included screenshots from
   several porn parodies with a note that they were Not Safe For Work.
   We’ve since removed those images. While the intent of this article was
   to provide a snapshot of the kind of gaming and geek porn that’s out
   there now, it’s clear in retrospect that, in terms of the images and
   the analysis you expect from us, we made a mistake. Readers are
   understandably uncomfortable about these kinds of depictions of
   characters who are often depicted as or thought of as teenagers. I am,
   too and apologize. We can do better, and we will. - Stephen Totilo,
   Editor-in-Chief

   The other day, I called my friend and asked her if she would be down to
   watch a bunch of video game porn with me so I could write about it.

   I am blessed to have the kind of friends who would not only say yes to
   this kind of thing, but would actively plan a beer-and-porn evening
   where I could also snuggle up with her gigantic fluffy beast of a dog.
   Before you all start making creepy comments, the porn wasn’t remotely
   sexy. It was hilarious, and I wanted someone else to laugh at how bad
   it was. Plus, my friend had been in porn herself, too. I wanted her
   expertise. And also to cuddle her dog.

   NSFW Warning: Explicit scenes of computer-rendered sex.

   We began with some extremely terrible Harry Potter porn. My friend and
   I are both into Harry Potter, as much as you can be now that the author
   has turned out to be a trans-exclusionary feminist who clumsily retcons
   diversity into her work.

   There were four episodes, each centering on a different coupling, each
   using the low-poly models from, I would guess, one of the PlayStation 2
   games. Most of them—for reasons only the creator can know—involved
   Crabbe. Or Goyle. I don’t know or care about the difference, honestly.
   Let’s just say Crabbe.

   It would have been quite an entertaining watch if it wasn’t for the
   utter disregard for accuracy. Hermione and Crabbe met up in the
   Gryffindor common room (which is unlikely, as Crabbe would need the
   password) and then had sex on the sofa in front of the fire. Crabbe
   magically removed Hermione’s uniform with a wordless spell (which is
   magic far too advanced for Crabbe) and then, at the end, ejaculated a
   weird, stringy slime onto her. In another scene, Draco rimmed Cho Chang
   in the hospital while Ron and Hermione had a cheeky shag next door
   (which seems logistically unlikely, not to mention unhygienic).

   Finally, Harry got into the girls’ dormitory to get a blowjob from
   Ginny (impossible, since it’s enchanted against boys—the dormitory,
   that is, not Ginny’s vagina). All the while, Cho and Hermione lay fully
   naked on top of their bedsheets, and at the end Harry transformed into
   Draco and looked right at the camera.

   If anyone actually manages to find any of that sexy, I take my hat off
   to them. Especially as none of the female models had clitorises.

   Then, we found some Zelda porn. It’s hardly surprising that these
   videos turned Link into a flat-assed dude with the sexual prowess of a
   spoon, a dick as thick as a forearm, and a shaft that flopped around at
   the tip like a fancy vacuum cleaner attachment. That’s what porn seems
   to require from men, and it’s disappointing. Link is pretty sexy with
   his clothes on, after all. Can’t we make him a little more of a hunk in
   porn?

   The first scene we saw was Link and Mipha, which is a pretty obvious
   pairing, although I now know that Mipha has nipples and a gag reflex.
   This one, unlike a lot of others, is actually voiced, which meant
   hearing Mipha’s girlish voice going “mm, ah, oh, slorp” more often than
   I would have liked. It wasn’t a bad scene, especially after the Harry
   Potter ones, but not a particularly inventive one, either.

   Advertisement

   While Link and Mipha were making tadpoles, Zelda was having sex with
   Bokoblins. As you do. In a surprisingly accurate treatment of the
   source material, however, Zelda is pictured wearing the Bokoblin mask,
   which makes the little creeps accept you as one of their own. Hence,
   the sex. She even attempts to give head to the Moblins, the
   ten-foot-tall enemies from the game, apparently with dicks to match.

   All the while, her actual in-game voiceover plays, asking Link, “How
   did it come to this?” She pleads with him to help, wailing, “I’m
   sorry—my power is not strong enough,” as her face is plastered with
   rails of jizz. “Wake up, Link,” she says, after consuming enough
   Bokoblin sperm to feed a family. “Open your eyes.” And he does. It was
   only a nightmare! A weirdly specific nightmare!

   Finally, we found some animated Pokémon porn. The first scene was
   between Jessie, Ash, and Pikachu (who had a human penis). It was
   boring. The second was between Misty, Hypno, and Lickitung. It was
   horrifying. Hypno uses his hypnosis powers for evil, while Lickitung
   slaps his big wet tongue all over Misty’s shorts, for some reason. At
   one point, Misty... sucks off the tongue? I don’t want to have sex with
   Pokémon, but surely there are more exciting scenarios than “being in a
   threesome with a walking tongue and a magician”?

   I left my friend’s house covered in dog hair, drunk from the beers, and
   potentially put off sex forever. I know people want to have sex with
   video game characters. I wouldn’t say no to Solid Snake and his dummy
   thicc ass. But it’s just not there yet. I’d love to see a video with
   the inventiveness of the Pokémon porn done in a slightly less gross
   way, with the attention to detail of the Zelda porn, plus the
   references to the source material that the Harry Potter porn attempted
   (and failed) to do. The ingredients are all there, but the cake is
   still a lie.

   Illustration for article titled David Hayter Delivers A Rousing
   Performance Re: Solid Snake&#39;s Ass
   Screenshot: Metal Gear Solid 2 (Konami)

   It is a truth universally acknowledged that Metal Gear’s Solid Snake
   has a big fat ass. This basic underpinning of our universe has now
   reached all corners of the internet, including Solid Snake’s longtime
   voice actor.

   Solid Snake is the leading character in a game about stealth, so it
   stands to reason that he would wear something akin to a catsuit in the
   Metal Gear games. What is more curious is how he gets his catsuit to
   outline his individual ass cheeks. Snake’s ass is exactingly rendered,
   and beloved by Metal Gear fans. When fans realized that Snake’s ass
   looked flatter in the previews for Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, they
   were aghast. Such is their devotion to Snake’s ass.

   Advertisement

   In early January, Twitter user Snow_Radish made a joke about Snake’s
   rotund posterior. In case you aren’t aware of what “dummy thicc” means,
   just know that it actually accurately describes the proportions of
   Solid Snake’s buttocks. Though not all would agree, I feel like Snake’s
   butt cheeks are at the size where accidentally clapping your ass is a
   real risk for him. Snow_Radish’s tweet went mildly viral:

   That same day, Hachikosyndrome tweeted herself reading Snow_Radish’s
   joke while mimicking David Hayter’s longtime rendition of Solid Snake’s
   voice.

   Advertisement

   Hayter’s gravelly intonations and distinctive cadence are synonymous
   with Solid Snake in the West. If you check out his page on Cameo, a
   website where you can pay voice actors and other minor celebrities to
   record video messages, all of his most recent requests are Hayter
   saying “happy birthday” to various people as Solid Snake.

   Combining Solid Snake, the idea of being horny, and the phrase “dummy
   thicc” proved to be irresistible to people on the internet. Some people
   on TikTok even took to acting out the tweet.

   Advertisement

   This joke has since gained enough popularity so that Hayter has not
   only seen it, he’s recorded his own version of the phrase.

   Advertisement

   Hayter said in a tweet that he personally recorded himself saying the
   words “dummy thicc,” for his friend’s son, who is active on TikTok.
   Every time I hear it or think about it, I start laughing. He’s just so
   angry by the end. Solid Snake cannot abide his ass-clapping alerting
   the guards.

   Advertisement

   If you want to make Hayter say something equally ridiculous, go on
   ahead and check him out on Cameo. For only 50 bucks, he’ll wish you a
   happy birthday, or, I don’t know, recite the lyrics to “Twerk” by City
   Girls ft. Cardi B.

   Illustration for article titled A Modern Warfare Game Option Is PS4
   Exclusive Until October 2020

   The practice of platform holders securing console exclusives took a new
   and weird turn yesterday, when Sony and Activision announced that
   Modern Warfare’s Survival Mode—a mode within a mode, as it’s part of
   Spec Ops—is appearing exclusively on the PS4 until October 1, 2020.

   Spec Ops, first introduced in the original Modern Warfare 2, is a
   series of short scripted missions that can either be played solo or
   co-op. They’ve been missing from the last few Call of Duty games, so
   their return here has been seen as a welcome move by longtime series
   fans.

   That excitement from PC and Xbox users will be a little tempered by
   yesterday’s announcement, though. While the core Spec Ops experience
   will appear on all platforms, Survival Mode—basically a Horde mode for
   Call of Duty, available as an option within Spec Ops—won’t be turning
   up outside the PS4 until October 2020, which conveniently is right
   around the time the next Call of Duty game will be due.

   This isn’t the first time Sony has secured an exclusivity deal for Call
   of Duty content, but those have previously been for a matter of days.
   To lock something down for almost an entire year (the game is due out
   on October 25) is a little more drastic.

   You can see the exclusive announced twice in the video below, once at
   the beginning in small print, and again near the end.

Indie Game Offers Special Font For Dyslexic Players

   Illustration for article titled Indie Game Offers Special Font For
   Dyslexic Players
   Screenshot: Overland

   Overland, the road-tripping survival game that Kotaku editor Riley
   MacLeod recently described as an “indie rock XCOM,” is often
   unforgiving by design. During development, however, the developers
   realized it was also challenging in one way they hadn’t intended: the
   font was too difficult for players with dyslexia to read.

   At last year’s PAX East in Boston, according to the game’s co-designer
   Rebekah Saltsman, one player approached the developers and said that it
   was difficult for them read the on-screen text due to their dyslexia.
   This added a new accessibility goal to the Overland team’s pre-launch
   worklist.

   Advertisement

   “I think about this and other accessibility options a lot,” Saltsman
   said on Twitter. “How do we signal that games aren’t ‘for you?’ I want
   people to play. And a lot of play engages with failure, but the way our
   brains process letters shouldn’t be what we are failing at, the way our
   eyes see color shouldn’t be where we fail, the way our bodies can use
   controls shouldn’t be where we fail.”

   Dyslexia is defined by the Mayo Clinic as “a learning disorder that
   involves difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds
   and learning how they relate to letters and words.” Folks with dyslexia
   often share symptoms like non-existent movement in text and a confusion
   between similar letters like ‘b’ and ‘d’, all of which can add up to a
   very frustrating experience. As video games have become more and more
   popular, dyslexia accessibility has remained a sticking point for those
   that struggle with this disorder.

   When I first booted up Overland on my Switch last week, I was surprised
   to find it included an option to replace the basic, in-game fonts with
   one that’s more friendly to the dyslexic brain known as OpenDyslexic.
   The differences are subtle, but anecdotal accounts indicate that folks
   who are have found this option very helpful.

   Advertisement

   OpenDyslexic is an open-source, free-to-use font that aims to improve
   readability for those with dyslexia by adjusting the text in various
   ways. The wider spaces give letters more room to breathe, and the
   weighted bottoms help differentiate between the letters that dyslexia
   tends to mix up or even flip upside-down due to their similarities.
   These are very subtle adjustments that don’t impair reading for the
   average user but mean the world to at least one dyslexic gamer.

   The Last Door, an adventure game released by Blasphemous developers The
   Game Kitchen back in 2013, featured a similar font as part of its
   accessibility options. Their research indicated that just under 14% of
   The Last Door players utilized the dyslexia-friendly font, and while
   that doesn’t mean that many people who played the game were dyslexic,
   it does show that a significant portion of the userbase found the
   option either useful or at least preferable to the default text.

   Advertisement

   Accessibility continues to be an important talking point in the world
   of video game development, and thanks to organizations like AbleGamers,
   there have never been more resources for developers to utilize in
   making their games enjoyable for more players. Although the science
   behind the efficacy of dyslexic fonts is still up for debate—the
   creators of OpenDyslexic themselves are very open about the font not
   working for everyone with dyslexia—it’s clear that the work being done
   by developers such as Finji and The Game Kitchen is important to
   bringing more gamers into the fold.

Malik Yoba Storms Off Set After Being Pressed on Allegations of Soliciting
Sex From a Minor

   Actor Malik Yoba stormed off the set during an on-camera interview with
   The Root Friday after being asked about allegations that he solicited
   sex from a minor who engaged in survival sex work in the late 1990s and
   early 2000s. The walkout was also seemingly triggered by questions
   about his motives for publishing an Instagram post that declared his
   love and attraction for trans women, which has since been deleted.

   During the conversation at The Root’s studios, The Root asked Yoba to
   respond to a Facebook post by Mariah Lopez Ebony, in which she accuses
   the actor of soliciting sex from her at ages 13 and 16. Yoba said, “I
   don’t know the woman,” and “I have no idea who she is.” In a phone
   interview with The Root on Saturday, Lopez, now 34, stood by her
   claims, saying her first sex act with Yoba took place at age 13, and
   the second act occurred at age 16.

   Lopez was born April 27, 1985, so the first sexual act would have
   likely taken place in 1998 and the second act in 2001. Lopez is a
   long-time trans rights activist and executive director of STARR, the
   Strategic Trans Alliance for Radical Reform, founded by trans pioneers
   Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson. Lopez alleges Yoba, now 52, would
   drive around New York’s Greenwich Village area looking for trans women
   to pay for sex.
   Advertisement

   Here is an excerpt from Lopez’s Facebook post:

     I started seeing him personally, with my own two eyes, cruising
     around the meatpacking district and Village, large black Jeep,
     looking for Trans fem sex workers, he preferred black trans girls;
     pretty, slim girls, but would pick up a latinx if she was put
     together and/or looked mixed.

     That was close to 20 years ago, and I can still remember it like
     yesterday. i also remember the day a friend of mine said, real cool,
     like she was known to do “.......walk down that block..Just go! He
     wants You.....”. You always remember celebrity clients. It’s like
     time slows down. You remember every detail, Blood pounding. He was
     cute, and polite, don’t get me wrong. But I’m sure he knew what he
     was doing, was Wrong.....

   The first time Lopez claims she had sex with Yoba for pay took place in
   1998 in either the West Village or the Meatpacking District, when an
   adult sex worker escorted her to Yoba’s “larger black SUV or jeep” that
   may have been a Ford Explorer or Excursion. Lopez says the woman who
   took her to Yoba’s vehicle is unwilling to speak publicly for fear of
   legal reprisals for her involvement in the transaction between Yoba and
   Lopez, and that the woman has secured legal counsel. Once Lopez entered
   the car, Yoba handed her $80 for sex. She declined to go into details
   of exactly what took place.

   “I will say, that based on my personal experience in the instance
   you’re inquiring about but also my further knowledge of him personally,
   he has a proclivity for sexual intercourse that is homoerotic,” says
   Lopez.
   Advertisement

   Lopez also noted that Yoba wanted to engage in the sex act without
   protection. She further recounts that she normally charged “a bill,” or
   $100, for the act, but that Yoba only had $80 at the time of the
   encounter.

   During the second meeting, Lopez said Yoba parked in the Greenwich
   Village area where she was working, turned off his lights, and stared
   at her, which she says is a common way for clients to pick up sex
   workers. Lopez walked by his car and he told her to get in, she said.

   “When I got in the car and he recognized who I was, he was slightly
   annoyed because I am not necessarily a ‘good ho,’” one who would let
   him dictate the terms of the encounter unchallenged.

   Yoba insisted on picking the route to the location where the act would
   take place, Lopez said. “Sometimes you go in the car and you direct the
   client where to go,” she said. “Not only was he a veteran-ass trick, so
   it was not surprising that he wanted to choose the route; but also just
   being a celebrity, you let them drive always, [and] he had a very
   specific route, a circle of comfort, a zone.”

   Lopez said they ended up in a Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood park, where
   they engaged in a sexual act for pay. Yoba tried to not use protection,
   but Lopez was able to convince him otherwise, she says.

   Another black trans woman, Ja’nese Bussey, who performed sex work with
   Lopez during the late 1990s and early 2000s, told The Root in a
   separate phone interview Saturday that Lopez told her she performed sex
   acts with Yoba for pay soon after the first act took place. Bussey
   confirmed Lopez was 13-years-old at the time. On two occasions, Bussey,
   who says she went by the name “Charisse” during her time as a sex
   worker, said Yoba gave her money in exchange for sex. He also asked her
   if she could find him “teenage girls” for sex, Bussey claims.
   Advertisement

   Bussey, 40, said that there was no doubt that Lopez looked underage at
   the time the first alleged sex act with Yoba took place. “She looked
   10,” Bussey added.

   A representative for Yoba said in a statement to The Root that the
   actor “categorically denies all allegations and will not respond,
   beyond this comment, to requests for comment.”

   It is not uncommon for underage trans teens to enter survival sex work
   because their parents often kick them out because they refuse to accept
   their trans identity. Polaris Project finds that the average age of
   entry into sex work is 19-years-old, but that is a general figure that
   is not specific to trans sex workers. Diamond Collier, a board member
   of Black Transwomen Inc., says it is not uncommon for trans children to
   enter sex work at 13 years old and that she herself was faced with a
   choice of entering a group home or doing sex work after she
   transitioned as a teen.

   “In that moment, I was given that option to get into sex work or [go to
   the group home]. So there’s a lot of situations where girls have no
   other options,” said Collier, who also performed sex work, starting at
   age 23 until she was 28. “Trans girls, especially back in the day,
   couldn’t go to shelters that were for guys or girls. They didn’t have
   anywhere to go. And sometimes some of the LGBTQ shelters didn’t take
   you back in the day unless you were HIV-positive. So how the system is
   set up, it forces girls to get in that kind of work.”

   In Yoba’s on-camera interview with The Root, he gave this response to
   Mariah’s Facebook allegations:

   The Root [7:11]: Since creating these posts, you’ve received a mixture
   of support and criticisms. On a more serious note, a trans woman named
   Mariah Lopez Ebony wrote a Facebook post in which she accused you of
   soliciting sex from her as a minor when she was both 13 and 16 years
   old. What do you have to say to this allegation?
   Advertisement

   Yoba [7:34]: I say that, you know, when I heard that, and I actually
   didn’t read it until last Thursday, what she actually said, I don’t
   know the woman, number one…

   The Root [7:44]: So, you’re saying you never met her, you don’t know
   her?

   Yoba [7:47]: That’s exactly what I am saying. I don’t know her. I have
   no idea who she is. I am familiar with that pain, I’m familiar with
   that trauma. I’m familiar with people who are crying out for help. I’m
   familiar with the lack of regard for this population, which is, again,
   my point. So, when I heard it, for me, to hear something so heinous,
   right, number one, and to see someone post something with no proof of
   anything and to see the world embrace it, or a portion of the world
   embrace it, that toxicity, speaks exactly to the reason I do the work
   that I do.
   Advertisement

   So, it’s an oxymoron almost. It’s like wow, the first cis-gender man
   who stands up for the community and gets attacked by that community.
   But that’s true for anybody that’s ever stood up for oppressed people.
   It’s happened to Gandhi. It’s happened to Mandela. It’s happened to
   Marcus Garvey. It’s happened to Malcolm X. It’s happened to anyone who
   has said, ‘I am gonna stand up for these oppressed people.’ Think about
   who we are, right? There was a time we couldn’t drink from water
   fountains, we couldn’t sit on the bus. Think about how ridiculous that
   is. And so, for me, having a view of a community that I grew up with
   and seeing the suffering. The very thing that motivates me to help
   people out of it is something someone tried to accuse me of…

   When The Root tried to interject, Yoba interrupted.

   Yoba [9:11]: I wanna finish the point. So, the point is to be on the
   other side of that tells me that the work has to continue and the
   blessing will be greater because the truth will always outweigh a lie.
   Right? So the truth is people are suffering. The truth is there are
   kids in the street. Right? But the other truth is for my entire life, I
   am someone who has been working with young people since I was 16 years
   old, making sure that there are better pathways for other people, so,
   that’s a very loaded question for you to ask me that and we discussed
   that before.

   At this point in the interview, it was emphasized that Yoba and The
   Root had established an understanding during an initial Sept. 16
   conversation regarding the allegations between Yoba and senior reporter
   Terrell Jermaine Starr, as well as the negative perceptions of him in
   the trans community. A wider conversation about his activism and his
   upcoming projects were also discussed in that meeting with Yoba and his
   publicists, and it was stated that these issues would be discussed in
   the Sept. 20 interview.

   The interview took a turn when The Root asked Yoba if he worried people
   would perceive his answer to the assault allegations as centering
   himself.
   Advertisement

   Yoba [10:17]: Yeah, you know, um, this is a bullet wound. Right? We’re
   on 45th Street and Broadway. I got shot five blocks from here at the
   age of 15. Right? A quarter of an inch over I would have been paralyzed
   from the neck down. A half-inch over I’d be dead. So, since January 18,
   1983, I’ve never taken a second for granted to be alive. I can’t even
   count how many people who are no longer here I grew up with that I’ve
   known. Numbers? I don’t even know how many it is. Right? And so life is
   precious and each moment is precious. So for someone who has long
   understood the power of thought and the power of intention, the ability
   to manifest my life the way I’ve wanted to. I never had a job I didn’t
   want. I’ve never had to work just to make money. Every single thing
   I’ve done in my life, whether I was a bike messenger, you know, working
   with young people, making movies, TV, working in education, working
   with the criminal justice system, working environment, working with
   fathers. Any social issue, professional pursuit, every single thing
   I’ve done it’s because it’s an intention. And I followed the intention
   and I chased the purpose, right?

   And so, to stand up in the face of someone saying that you’re this when
   I know I am this, I also felt, Wow. That’s kinda how it feels like to
   be transgender [12:14]. Right? Can you imagine walking into the world,
   looking the way you and I do, but feeling inside that something is not
   lining up and you need to address that. The way you present in the
   world and you don’t look so good.
   Advertisement

   The Root [12:30]: I don’t think I could ever or anybody who is
   cisgender could ever place themselves in a trans person’s position.

   Yoba [12:37]: I think we can because I had to do it on New York
   Undercover. So, on New York Undercover, we did an episode where people
   were killing transgender people. So we actually had to dress and go
   into the world…
   Advertisement

   The Root [12:50]: That’s fiction, though. That’s not real life.

   Yoba [12:53]: Yeah, but you’re missing my point. You’re making your
   point. The point that I’m making is that you asked me what does it feel
   like to stand up in the face of this. And I’m telling you that if I am
   this and someone is calling me this, that is akin to a transgender
   woman being called a man.
   Advertisement

   The Root [13:14]: Do you really make that comparison?

   Yoba [13:17]: I do. You may not make it but I’m making the comparison
   because I sat in it. I know what it’s like for people to try and yell
   at me and tell me I’m gay, to tell me I’m a pedophile, to tell me what
   I’m not. And I have to stand up to that. And the only thing I can do is
   stand up with the truth. And, so, when you feel that pain, when you
   walk down the street and people are basically saying, ‘Fuck you’ and
   you still walk on your purpose, that’s empowering. As painful as it is,
   it’s also empowering. And so when I talk to my transgender friends and
   they have people tell them what they’re not and they’re telling you
   that they are, that’s painful for them too.
   Advertisement

   So if I am gonna be the person, the first one, to stand up and take the
   hits. I know what it feels like and I feel I have the right to say,
   yes, as I stand alongside you, I do understand your pain. Not on an
   intellectual level but on an experiential level. I was walking down the
   street the other and someone said ‘Happy Birthday, AIDS victim.’ They
   screamed that out of a window to me. I lost work because of this, just
   like trans people. I have people look at me sideways just like trans
   people. I have people calling me gay, just like trans people. So I have
   the right to tell you exactly how it feels if I choose to stand up with
   these folks that I love and appreciate and consider part of my
   humanity. And I can tell you what it feels like.

   The Root went on to ask Yoba about allegations from trans sex workers
   who claimed that he solicited sex from them. Yoba replied that he
   didn’t know what the reporter was talking about. When asked how he
   reacts to criticisms that he does not actually care for trans people
   and that he fetishizes trans women, Yoba became demonstrably upset.
   Advertisement

   Yoba walked away from his chair, threw his microphone to the floor,
   yelled “fuck you” to this reporter and the production team and demanded
   that he be given the SD video cards that recorded the interview, which
   The Root’s producers refused to do.

   Witnesses to Yoba’s profanity-laced meltdown were two video producers
   for The Root, two people representing Yoba, his 18-year-old daughter,
   and The Root’s senior video producer. Yoba’s publicists and The Root’s
   video producers tried to calm him down, but Yoba continued cursing
   until he finally left the studio.
   Advertisement

   Yoba is scheduled to co-host a workshop leading up to the Trans
   National Visibility March this Thursday amid criticisms that his
   presence and the allegation by Lopez will take up space that is
   supposed to be focused on trans people. Trans activists have expressed
   concerns to The Root that Yoba has not demonstrated adequate knowledge
   to speak on behalf of trans issues and that his public statements are
   designed to elevate himself at trans people’s expense.

   Collier says that she was very proud of Yoba when he published his
   Instagram post expressing his love for trans women and the need for
   more black men to follow his lead. But she is not familiar with any of
   his work in the trans community during her 20 years of national
   organizing.
   Advertisement

   “Conversations around Malik Yoba have centered around his participation
   in consenting adult sex work,” Collier said. “In the community, he is
   known to be a client. He’s known to be a nice guy. He’s known to be
   somebody that fetishizes us. I haven’t heard anything bad. Mariah was
   the first story that was weird and bad.”

   In media interviews, Yoba has mentioned Tiq Milan, a black trans
   activist in New York City, as someone who he has spoken to about trans
   issues. Milan, who is a trans man, told The Root that he could not
   speak to Yoba’s activism in the trans community and that he has only
   known him for a month after reaching out to thank him for his Instagram
   post. Despite the negative perceptions Milan has heard about Yoba, he
   said it was important for the actor to speak out.
   Advertisement

   “I think Malik’s story is important,” Milan said. “I also think that it
   is a part of a larger conversation about the culture of lovelessness
   around transgender people, the homicide rate of black transgender women
   and expanding our outlook and definitions of love, desire, and
   masculinity.”

   Many trans women have gone on social media to question Yoba’s sincerity
   and motives. Sharon L. Cooks, a transgender woman who works as a
   business consultant in Philadelphia, said in a Facebook video that
   Yoba’s recent statements of being attracted to trans women are a
   publicity stunt.
   Advertisement

   “Let’s be very clear on what’s going on here,” Cooks said in her video.
   “Where was Malik in the ’90s when it wasn’t so popular? Where was Malik
   Yoba when he was 26 and he was liking women of trans experience? Where
   was he?”

   In a statement to The Root, organizers of the Trans National Visibility
   March said that Yoba was not directly involved with the march, adding:

     “We do respect the fact that Malik Yoba stood out to support himself
     and men like him. There currently is not a visible platform for
     trans amorous men and the work that Malik Yoba is doing is
     necessary. However, we believe that our work should be
     intersectional and that includes bridging the gaps and making space
     for other identities to be visible. It is not our duty to create
     space for them at this time when we are creating a visible space for
     ourselves. As leaders, it is our duty to be intersectional in our
     work and not exclusionary. We have a duty to fight for the
     liberation of all people but we must first stand for ourselves and
     heal. This is why we march!”

   Advertisement

   Still, Collier is concerned that the national attention Yoba has
   brought to the trans community may be doing more harm than good.

   “You have a community that is ravaged with ridicule,” said Collier, who
   is the creator and host of the podcast Marsha’s Plate. “You have people
   doing comedy specials ridiculing us on the public mainstage. You have
   people burning us up in cars. It is a community that is in desperation
   for somebody. And it can be anybody, somebody stepping up and proud of
   loving us, being friends with us, being an ally with us. We kind of
   automatically prop them up in a position of admiration, in a position
   of bravery, a position of gratitude. We appreciate them doing that.
   Advertisement

   “But the problem with that is a lot of people who want to be allies,
   who want to be partners with us in this activism work, don’t have the
   cultural competency to actually do the work in a way that is not
   harmful. So when I saw those videos and I saw what was happening on the
   (Breakfast Club interview), it seemed like [Yoba] and the host were not
   socially equipped to handle the level of conversation that’s needed to
   push the culture forward when it comes to black trans people, black
   trans love, and particularly black trans women. They don’t have the
   experience. He’s done work with his career. He’s done work around
   himself. But in regards to our particular community, he’s not doing
   work. I don’t believe that at all.”

   The Root editor Angela Bronner Helm contributed reporting to this
   story.

Animated Video Game Porn Could Be A Lot Sexier And Less Gross

   Editor’s Note - 5:25pm: This story, part of our regular coverage of the
   intersection of sex and games, originally included screenshots from
   several porn parodies with a note that they were Not Safe For Work.
   We’ve since removed those images. While the intent of this article was
   to provide a snapshot of the kind of gaming and geek porn that’s out
   there now, it’s clear in retrospect that, in terms of the images and
   the analysis you expect from us, we made a mistake. Readers are
   understandably uncomfortable about these kinds of depictions of
   characters who are often depicted as or thought of as teenagers. I am,
   too and apologize. We can do better, and we will. - Stephen Totilo,
   Editor-in-Chief

   The other day, I called my friend and asked her if she would be down to
   watch a bunch of video game porn with me so I could write about it.

   I am blessed to have the kind of friends who would not only say yes to
   this kind of thing, but would actively plan a beer-and-porn evening
   where I could also snuggle up with her gigantic fluffy beast of a dog.
   Before you all start making creepy comments, the porn wasn’t remotely
   sexy. It was hilarious, and I wanted someone else to laugh at how bad
   it was. Plus, my friend had been in porn herself, too. I wanted her
   expertise. And also to cuddle her dog.

   NSFW Warning: Explicit scenes of computer-rendered sex.

   We began with some extremely terrible Harry Potter porn. My friend and
   I are both into Harry Potter, as much as you can be now that the author
   has turned out to be a trans-exclusionary feminist who clumsily retcons
   diversity into her work.

   Advertisement

   There were four episodes, each centering on a different coupling, each
   using the low-poly models from, I would guess, one of the PlayStation 2
   games. Most of them—for reasons only the creator can know—involved
   Crabbe. Or Goyle. I don’t know or care about the difference, honestly.
   Let’s just say Crabbe.

   It would have been quite an entertaining watch if it wasn’t for the
   utter disregard for accuracy. Hermione and Crabbe met up in the
   Gryffindor common room (which is unlikely, as Crabbe would need the
   password) and then had sex on the sofa in front of the fire. Crabbe
   magically removed Hermione’s uniform with a wordless spell (which is
   magic far too advanced for Crabbe) and then, at the end, ejaculated a
   weird, stringy slime onto her. In another scene, Draco rimmed Cho Chang
   in the hospital while Ron and Hermione had a cheeky shag next door
   (which seems logistically unlikely, not to mention unhygienic).

   Advertisement

   Finally, Harry got into the girls’ dormitory to get a blowjob from
   Ginny (impossible, since it’s enchanted against boys—the dormitory,
   that is, not Ginny’s vagina). All the while, Cho and Hermione lay fully
   naked on top of their bedsheets, and at the end Harry transformed into
   Draco and looked right at the camera.

   If anyone actually manages to find any of that sexy, I take my hat off
   to them. Especially as none of the female models had clitorises.

   Advertisement

   Then, we found some Zelda porn. It’s hardly surprising that these
   videos turned Link into a flat-assed dude with the sexual prowess of a
   spoon, a dick as thick as a forearm, and a shaft that flopped around at
   the tip like a fancy vacuum cleaner attachment. That’s what porn seems
   to require from men, and it’s disappointing. Link is pretty sexy with
   his clothes on, after all. Can’t we make him a little more of a hunk in
   porn?

   The first scene we saw was Link and Mipha, which is a pretty obvious
   pairing, although I now know that Mipha has nipples and a gag reflex.
   This one, unlike a lot of others, is actually voiced, which meant
   hearing Mipha’s girlish voice going “mm, ah, oh, slorp” more often than
   I would have liked. It wasn’t a bad scene, especially after the Harry
   Potter ones, but not a particularly inventive one, either.

   Advertisement

   While Link and Mipha were making tadpoles, Zelda was having sex with
   Bokoblins. As you do. In a surprisingly accurate treatment of the
   source material, however, Zelda is pictured wearing the Bokoblin mask,
   which makes the little creeps accept you as one of their own. Hence,
   the sex. She even attempts to give head to the Moblins, the
   ten-foot-tall enemies from the game, apparently with dicks to match.

   All the while, her actual in-game voiceover plays, asking Link, “How
   did it come to this?” She pleads with him to help, wailing, “I’m
   sorry—my power is not strong enough,” as her face is plastered with
   rails of jizz. “Wake up, Link,” she says, after consuming enough
   Bokoblin sperm to feed a family. “Open your eyes.” And he does. It was
   only a nightmare! A weirdly specific nightmare!

   Advertisement

   Finally, we found some animated Pokémon porn. The first scene was
   between Jessie, Ash, and Pikachu (who had a human penis). It was
   boring. The second was between Misty, Hypno, and Lickitung. It was
   horrifying. Hypno uses his hypnosis powers for evil, while Lickitung
   slaps his big wet tongue all over Misty’s shorts, for some reason. At
   one point, Misty... sucks off the tongue? I don’t want to have sex with
   Pokémon, but surely there are more exciting scenarios than “being in a
   threesome with a walking tongue and a magician”?

   I left my friend’s house covered in dog hair, drunk from the beers, and
   potentially put off sex forever. I know people want to have sex with
   video game characters. I wouldn’t say no to Solid Snake and his dummy
   thicc ass. But it’s just not there yet. I’d love to see a video with
   the inventiveness of the Pokémon porn done in a slightly less gross
   way, with the attention to detail of the Zelda porn, plus the
   references to the source material that the Harry Potter porn attempted
   (and failed) to do. The ingredients are all there, but the cake is
   still a lie.

David Hayter Delivers A Rousing Performance Re: Solid Snake's Ass

   Illustration for article titled David Hayter Delivers A Rousing
   Performance Re: Solid Snake&#39;s Ass
   Screenshot: Metal Gear Solid 2 (Konami)

   It is a truth universally acknowledged that Metal Gear’s Solid Snake
   has a big fat ass. This basic underpinning of our universe has now
   reached all corners of the internet, including Solid Snake’s longtime
   voice actor.

   Solid Snake is the leading character in a game about stealth, so it
   stands to reason that he would wear something akin to a catsuit in the
   Metal Gear games. What is more curious is how he gets his catsuit to
   outline his individual ass cheeks. Snake’s ass is exactingly rendered,
   and beloved by Metal Gear fans. When fans realized that Snake’s ass
   looked flatter in the previews for Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, they
   were aghast. Such is their devotion to Snake’s ass.

   Advertisement

   In early January, Twitter user Snow_Radish made a joke about Snake’s
   rotund posterior. In case you aren’t aware of what “dummy thicc” means,
   just know that it actually accurately describes the proportions of
   Solid Snake’s buttocks. Though not all would agree, I feel like Snake’s
   butt cheeks are at the size where accidentally clapping your ass is a
   real risk for him. Snow_Radish’s tweet went mildly viral:

   That same day, Hachikosyndrome tweeted herself reading Snow_Radish’s
   joke while mimicking David Hayter’s longtime rendition of Solid Snake’s
   voice.

   Hayter’s gravelly intonations and distinctive cadence are synonymous
   with Solid Snake in the West. If you check out his page on Cameo, a
   website where you can pay voice actors and other minor celebrities to
   record video messages, all of his most recent requests are Hayter
   saying “happy birthday” to various people as Solid Snake.

   Combining Solid Snake, the idea of being horny, and the phrase “dummy
   thicc” proved to be irresistible to people on the internet. Some people
   on TikTok even took to acting out the tweet.

   This joke has since gained enough popularity so that Hayter has not
   only seen it, he’s recorded his own version of the phrase.

   Advertisement

   Hayter said in a tweet that he personally recorded himself saying the
   words “dummy thicc,” for his friend’s son, who is active on TikTok.
   Every time I hear it or think about it, I start laughing. He’s just so
   angry by the end. Solid Snake cannot abide his ass-clapping alerting
   the guards.

   If you want to make Hayter say something equally ridiculous, go on
   ahead and check him out on Cameo. For only 50 bucks, he’ll wish you a
   happy birthday, or, I don’t know, recite the lyrics to “Twerk” by City
   Girls ft. Cardi B.

   Illustration for article titled A Modern Warfare Game Option Is PS4
   Exclusive Until October 2020

   The practice of platform holders securing console exclusives took a new
   and weird turn yesterday, when Sony and Activision announced that
   Modern Warfare’s Survival Mode—a mode within a mode, as it’s part of
   Spec Ops—is appearing exclusively on the PS4 until October 1, 2020.

   Spec Ops, first introduced in the original Modern Warfare 2, is a
   series of short scripted missions that can either be played solo or
   co-op. They’ve been missing from the last few Call of Duty games, so
   their return here has been seen as a welcome move by longtime series
   fans.

   That excitement from PC and Xbox users will be a little tempered by
   yesterday’s announcement, though. While the core Spec Ops experience
   will appear on all platforms, Survival Mode—basically a Horde mode for
   Call of Duty, available as an option within Spec Ops—won’t be turning
   up outside the PS4 until October 2020, which conveniently is right
   around the time the next Call of Duty game will be due.

   This isn’t the first time Sony has secured an exclusivity deal for Call
   of Duty content, but those have previously been for a matter of days.
   To lock something down for almost an entire year (the game is due out
   on October 25) is a little more drastic.

   You can see the exclusive announced twice in the video below, once at
   the beginning in small print, and again near the end.

Indie Game Offers Special Font For Dyslexic Players

   Illustration for article titled Indie Game Offers Special Font For
   Dyslexic Players
   Screenshot: Overland

   Overland, the road-tripping survival game that Kotaku editor Riley
   MacLeod recently described as an “indie rock XCOM,” is often
   unforgiving by design. During development, however, the developers
   realized it was also challenging in one way they hadn’t intended: the
   font was too difficult for players with dyslexia to read.

   At last year’s PAX East in Boston, according to the game’s co-designer
   Rebekah Saltsman, one player approached the developers and said that it
   was difficult for them read the on-screen text due to their dyslexia.
   This added a new accessibility goal to the Overland team’s pre-launch
   worklist.

   Advertisement

   “I think about this and other accessibility options a lot,” Saltsman
   said on Twitter. “How do we signal that games aren’t ‘for you?’ I want
   people to play. And a lot of play engages with failure, but the way our
   brains process letters shouldn’t be what we are failing at, the way our
   eyes see color shouldn’t be where we fail, the way our bodies can use
   controls shouldn’t be where we fail.”

   Dyslexia is defined by the Mayo Clinic as “a learning disorder that
   involves difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds
   and learning how they relate to letters and words.” Folks with dyslexia
   often share symptoms like non-existent movement in text and a confusion
   between similar letters like ‘b’ and ‘d’, all of which can add up to a
   very frustrating experience. As video games have become more and more
   popular, dyslexia accessibility has remained a sticking point for those
   that struggle with this disorder.

   Overland’s default font

   (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   1 / 2

   When I first booted up Overland on my Switch last week, I was surprised
   to find it included an option to replace the basic, in-game fonts with
   one that’s more friendly to the dyslexic brain known as OpenDyslexic.
   The differences are subtle, but anecdotal accounts indicate that folks
   who are have found this option very helpful.

   Advertisement

   OpenDyslexic is an open-source, free-to-use font that aims to improve
   readability for those with dyslexia by adjusting the text in various
   ways. The wider spaces give letters more room to breathe, and the
   weighted bottoms help differentiate between the letters that dyslexia
   tends to mix up or even flip upside-down due to their similarities.
   These are very subtle adjustments that don’t impair reading for the
   average user but mean the world to at least one dyslexic gamer.

   The Last Door, an adventure game released by Blasphemous developers The
   Game Kitchen back in 2013, featured a similar font as part of its
   accessibility options. Their research indicated that just under 14% of
   The Last Door players utilized the dyslexia-friendly font, and while
   that doesn’t mean that many people who played the game were dyslexic,
   it does show that a significant portion of the userbase found the
   option either useful or at least preferable to the default text.

   Advertisement

   Accessibility continues to be an important talking point in the world
   of video game development, and thanks to organizations like AbleGamers,
   there have never been more resources for developers to utilize in
   making their games enjoyable for more players. Although the science
   behind the efficacy of dyslexic fonts is still up for debate—the
   creators of OpenDyslexic themselves are very open about the font not
   working for everyone with dyslexia—it’s clear that the work being done
   by developers such as Finji and The Game Kitchen is important to
   bringing more gamers into the fold.

   Illustration for article titled Turn-Based Survival Game Overland Is
   Like An Indie Rock XCOM

   In my couple of hours with turn-based survival game Overland, I’ve
   lived multiple short, doomed lives in the post-apocalypse. These lives
   unfolded in in gas stations and on street corners, and they were filled
   with the pursuit of gas cans and pieces of garbage, like potted plants
   and lighters. Overland’s art is minimalist, but the game feels stuffed
   with mournful personality.

   Overland is a game by Finji, out today for PC, Switch, and Apple Arcade
   (Correction 2:03pm—Overland is also available for Xbox and PS4.). It
   takes place in a ravaged America beset by spiky monsters. They’re
   attracted to sound, and they call up reinforcements from underground
   when they’re injured or killed. At the start of the game, you’re
   assigned a random survivor and a car that’s running low on gas. Each
   level is a diorama-esque grid that you move across, gathering supplies,
   fighting or avoiding monsters, and saving other survivors to add to
   your road trip across America.

   In between turns, you choose a new location to go to from a sparse map.
   There might be survivors at one stop, who you can add to your party, or
   gas, or supplies like weapons or first aid kits. It costs different
   amounts of gas to get to these locations. Gas is hard to come by and
   was my most sought-after resource. I stayed too long in places in
   pursuit of it, or made risky treks across levels to drop items in favor
   of gas cans, go back to my car to fill it up, and then return for my
   other loot. Once, when I didn’t have enough gas to get to a new
   location, I found myself dumped into a dark level full of monsters. I
   did not survive long.

   The need for gas places a unique emphasis on your car. It’s the way you
   get from place to place, but it has more uses and presence than that.
   It can run over monsters, or be moved along the road to get closer to
   supplies or give your characters less far to walk. It also takes damage
   easily. In one playthrough, a large monster battered my car too many
   times, and I had to hurry to get my survivors out of the vehicle as
   flames flickered from the hood. Between the enemy and scenery
   placement, I couldn’t get them all far enough away from the car. My car
   exploded, killing two of them and forcing the remaining two to try,
   unsuccessfully, to escape the level on foot. I haven’t yet discovered
   how far you can get on foot, though some levels have cars you can
   requisition. The car’s necessity and fragility makes it feel like
   another one of your companions rather than just a means to an end.
   Illustration for article titled Turn-Based Survival Game Overland Is
   Like An Indie Rock XCOM
   Screenshot: Steam

   Overland is tough, but it’s also slow. Enemies aren’t as aggressive as
   they are in similar turn-based games like XCOM. You have time to avoid
   attacks, and enemies can often be killed in one strike. Also, the
   reinforcement monsters they call up take time to surface. Looting is
   also time-consuming, requiring you to move to a container, search it,
   and then fiddle with your inventory if need be. The car must be
   entered, then turned on, then driven. Levels are broken up by brief
   cutscenes set to moody indie music where characters briefly talk and
   then you choose your next location. The game doesn’t need these
   scenes—it’d be more expedient just to take you back to your map—but the
   methodical pace of them adds to the mood. This slowness makes the game
   feel post-apocalyptic more than the monsters and lack of resources
   does. Crawling from place to place feels effortful and sad, a contrast
   to the bustle of daily life that no longer exists for the characters.
   It makes the new world you find yourself in feel difficult, but also
   empty. There’s nothing to do anymore but survive, so you might as well
   take your time.

   This emptiness is emphasized by your companions, who lack faces or much
   personality. They’re described in small blurbs with descriptors like
   “kind of into this” or “doesn’t understand what the big deal is.” I
   felt attached to them the way you’d feel about a stranger waiting in a
   long post office line with you; I didn’t care about them in a specific
   sense, but I cared that they were there. Sometimes they’ll have
   backpacks, which let them carry more items, vital given your deeply
   limited inventory space. Other times they’ll have a positive or
   negative trait, like being able to throw things farther or making more
   noise when scavenging. Characters can be revived, but they’ll be
   injured, which results in limited actions per turn. Characters who were
   revived in their lives and described in a run’s final roundup as
   “ghosts,” lending a supernatural air to things.

   In one playthrough, my companions were two dogs. In a final standoff,
   my human character fell, followed by one of the dogs. Though the last
   dog stood no chance, he bravely killed several monsters before
   succumbing to the horde that surrounded him. It was, like many survival
   games, a small, doomed story that nevertheless felt grand in the
   moment, a whole life lived a world that just carried on through a new
   run.

   Advertisement

   The shoebox levels add to this sense of drama played out against a
   bigger, uncaring world. They’re chunks of landscape floating in space,
   similar to the visual layout of Into the Breach. This design makes
   areas feel isolated while also suggesting a whole world just beyond
   their borders. Levels can sometimes be hard to parse, especially if
   they’re dark, though you can zoom in and move the camera a bit. I
   surprised myself by taking advantage of the game’s photo mode (I tend
   to hate photo modes) to zoom in and capture dramatic tableaux, as well
   as to explore a level a little more fully. Sometimes you can push and
   pull objects that you come across, or dump gasoline and then set things
   on fire, but by and large you can’t alter the layout you’ve been given.
   Objects like dumpsters and traffic barriers are familiar to everyday
   life, but their placement and limited interactivity in this game makes
   them feel imposing.

   I’ve only played a couple of hours of Overland, but I’m excited to
   explore the game more. Judging from the menu, there are seven areas to
   pass through; you can start from new ones if you unlock them by
   clearing the road of debris at the end of each section. I’m currently
   making my way through the Woodlands, the second level, which has an
   autumnal color palate and bigger monsters than the starting East Coast
   area. I don’t know what else awaits me on the road, though my map has
   hinted at traders who might want the potted plants and books I’ve clung
   to. I’m curious to see what they’ll give me in exchange.

Gothic Platformer Offers Brutal Combat With A Side Of Religious Trauma

   Illustration for article titled Gothic Platformer Offers Brutal Combat
   With A Side Of Religious Trauma
   Screenshot: The Game Kitchen

   Blasphemous, the indie platformer that Spanish studio The Game Kitchen
   crowd-funded two years ago, is now available on every major gaming
   platform. While I wasn’t one of the Kickstarter backers, I have been
   looking forward to this release for some time, both as a fan of
   difficult Souls-like games and someone who has long had a complicated
   relationship with religion. Blasphemous delivers on both, providing a
   substantial challenge and bringing out some unexpectedly powerful
   feelings in me about my own religious upbringing.

   I was raised as a Seventh-day Adventist, which most people don’t know
   much about other than possibly having heard of the Waco siege.
   Essentially, Seventh-day Adventism is Christianity with a couple of key
   differences, the most prominent of which is observing the sabbath on
   Saturday rather than Sunday. My family joined the church when I was in
   fifth grade, and I was moved from a traditional Christian school to one
   run by the Adventist church around that time.

   Advertisement

   Like some Christian sects, Seventh-day Adventists have an almost
   paranoid obsession with the end times, or the period of time near the
   end of the world when the Antichrist will usher in the second coming of
   Jesus Christ. Where Adventists differ from most other sects, however,
   is that they believe there will be no Rapture, which is the phenomenon
   whereby the Christian god calls believers to heaven and leaves the rest
   of the world to deal with cataclysmic disasters and plagues. Adventists
   also believe that the Pope will reveal himself to be the Antichrist. As
   such, Catholicism is regarded by Adventists not as the Christian
   theology that it is but a wolf in sheep’s clothing, biding its time to
   seize control of the world.

   To get back to the first point in this explanation: no, the folks in
   Waco didn’t belong to the larger Seventh-day Adventist church, but
   rather, an offshoot. Still, it’s easy for me to see how a more extreme
   and cult-like version of Adventism could have emerged after I spent my
   formative years being indoctrinated into its core beliefs.

   Blasphemous is set in Cvstodia, an imagined empire of ritualistic
   adherence to fanatical religious tenets that draws very clear
   inspiration from the Catholic church. (Correction: 9/10/2019, 8:00 pm
   ET:.This story originally referred to the world as Orthodoxia, which
   was changed before release). The player character, known as the
   Penitent One, wears a large, pointed helmet reminiscent of the hoods
   worn by Catholic inquisitors in Spain and Portugal. Basic enemies
   consist of self-flagellating believers and bell-wielding nuns, and the
   architecture resembles the sharp steeples of places of worship from old
   Europe. Everywhere the player turns, statues honor unnamed saints, with
   frozen faces looking to the skies in supplication and stone arms
   reaching for heavenly salvation.

   But something is very wrong in Cvstodia. Religion has twisted and
   distorted the world, leaving behind a wasteland, albeit one that’s more
   Bloodborne than Mad Max. It’s clear that this apocalypse has had a
   devastating effect on the populace, many of whom now huddle for shelter
   in the ruins of temples that offer more tangible protection than
   religious teachings ever could. Every item the player collects in
   Blasphemous—from ability-enhancing rosary beads to bones of notable
   dead—is a testament to this lost era of history, detailing an
   excruciating past that saw the world collapse under the weight of its
   dogmatic hubris. Cvstodia is some of my worst childhood nightmares come
   to life, and my mind was flooded with these memories as soon as I
   stepped into the well-worn boots of the Penitent One.

   As a kid, I had a morbid fascination with the Catholic church. I would
   spend weekends anxiously poring through the histories of the
   inquisitions it inflicted on non-believers, starting in Europe and then
   carrying over to the Western hemisphere, with some of the most
   disgusting atrocities perpetrated against the native populations of
   North and South America. Having been told that the Catholic church
   would hand out similar punishment to Adventists once they took power
   behind the Antichrist, I became an emotional wreck over this as a
   child. Adventists do not believe in the rapture, and thus there would
   be no escape for me. How would I deal with being tortured on the rack?
   Would I feel anything before my head was guillotined from my neck?
   These aren’t the kinds of questions a pre-teen should have to deal
   with, but these images kept rattling around in my young mind.

   In my few hours with Blasphemous, the same sick feeling of fearful
   fascination has risen in my stomach, kept a bay only by the “must win”
   mentality with which I’ve been self-indoctrinated over decades of
   playing video games. Fortunately, the game-y aspects of Blasphemous are
   very good, providing a rewarding counterpoint to the unnerving memories
   that the setting happens to bring out in me. Traversing the crumbling
   landscape gives way to satisfying dodge- and parry-based combat and
   imaginative shortcuts that impart the same feeling of accomplishment as
   similar moments in games like Dark Souls. I’m constantly teetering
   somewhere between wanting to see the next area’s horrifying enemies and
   atmosphere and worried I’ll be struck down before finding the next
   health-restoring save point. The lore, which is told mostly through
   item descriptions, can be too on-the-nose and dark for the sake of
   being dark at times, but the way it folds together real religious
   iconography and the fantastic elements of Cvstodia has largely been
   just as clever as the combat.

   It’s hard for me to evaluate Blasphemous as a whole, and not just
   because I haven’t beaten it yet. Do I truly enjoy this experience, or
   does it just ping the same compulsive receptors in my mind that made me
   obsessively stare at a computer screen and scare myself with possible
   futures of torture and execution in my youth? Cvstodia’s devastated
   landscape resembles my current relationship with more extreme Christian
   religions, its few, fearful adherents still giving thanks through
   prayer yet eyeing the skies in fear of the next bloody horror to come
   screeching down upon them. Blasphemous has reminded me that I am still
   dealing with the sticky residue of indoctrination all these years
   later, but there’s something about it that feels familiar and perhaps
   even comforting in some strange way.

Borderlands 3 Players Are Disappointed In Zane's Late-Game Weakness

   Joshua Rivera
   Today 1:00pm
   Filed to:Borderlands 3

   Some Borderlands 3 players believe that one member of the game’s roster
   of four playable characters is a bit of a lemon. It turns out that
   Zane, the Operative, is kind of a lousy performer when it comes to
   surviving Borderlands 3’s toughest post-game challenges. These problems
   don’t become clear until you reach the endgame, and by then, it’s
   already too late.

   Nearly two weeks after Borderlands 3 was released, many players are
   deep into the endgame, and some of them have been a bit frustrated by
   Zane’s high-level play. While he’s far from unuseable, his shortcomings
   have already become a bit of a meme, with players posting at length
   about how he seems to stack up poorly compared to the other three Vault
   Hunters. Granted, the game is two weeks old, and not everything is
   going to be perfectly balanced to everyone’s satisfaction. Still, Zane
   is an interesting case.

   Advertisement

   A lot of what players say makes Zane a subpar choice in the endgame
   are, unfortunately, the same things that make him so interesting in an
   initial playthrough. He’s the only character who can equip two action
   skills at once, and each of the three skills he can choose from seem
   pretty useful, at least in the first go-round. There’s a barrier he can
   deploy for cover (that can be upgraded to become a dome and buff
   allies), a drone, and a Digi-Clone decoy that fires at enemies and can
   also switch places with Zane at the press of a button.

   This assortment of skills makes Zane a good choice for a
   tactically-minded player. The problem is that Borderlands 3 isn’t much
   of tactically-minded game, and the other three characters have an
   assortment of skills more inclined to dealing a lot of damage in very
   little time. This means Zane is both an oddball better suited for an
   entirely different game and, long-term, a liability with no real
   power-play to deal heavy damage to a boss or save their teammates from
   a mob of enemies.

   Intrepid Borderlands 3 players are finding ways to make Zane work
   despite his skillset. YouTuber RyanCentral has a great build that
   emphasizes speed and kills, one that Forbes’ Paul Tassi has also
   replicated with success. There are also build guides on
   RockPaperShotgun that take advantage of the character’s versatility.
   Zane isn’t a lost cause.

   The problem is that other characters have builds that are so good it
   feels like cheating, which is the platonic ideal of a Borderlands
   character. Right now, one of the most popular builds in the game
   centers on FL4K, the robot beastmaster, and exploiting their skill
   trees’ various ways to multiply the amount of critical damage dealt.
   Seeing it in action is truly insane.

   Borderlands 3 does not make it that easy to change characters. You’re
   pretty much locked into your choice for the additional modes following
   the main campaign, which are new game plus (dubbed True Vault Hunter
   Mode) or Mayhem mode, the latter of which offers three tiers of
   increased difficulty for running bosses and sidequests post-game. You
   could start up another character in True Vault Hunter Mode and level
   them faster with the increased rewards doled out, but you’re still
   starting from level 1. Also, starting a True Vault Hunter run with
   whatever character you beat the campaign with lets you skip the slow
   tutorial mission while letting you keep your skills, gear, and current
   level. So why can’t I just roll a new level 30 character for my second
   playthrough? (This is the same thing previous Borderlands games did;
   it’s just too bad that the latest installment hasn’t improved on this.)

   As someone who chose Zane as my main, I’m feeling a little burned. I’m
   pretty interested in the the game’s wealth of endgame content and
   extensive post-release plans. Tonal issues aside, it’s nice to play a
   loot shooter that feels like it’s completely busted in your favor.
   Playing as Zane doesn’t seem like it’s going to give me that
   experience, though. I’m not leveled high enough to have anything close
   to a good endgame build for him yet, but I’m already starting to feel
   the pinch. Zane just isn’t good at surviving, or dealing enough
   high-impact damage to make boss fights feel like less of a grueling
   experience. I want to feel like a superhero, but mostly I feel like a
   chump.

   Here’s hoping Borderlands 3 gets something akin to Diablo 3’s Adventure
   Mode, where you can just roll a character and run whatever challenges
   you want. In the meantime, I guess I’ll try my hand at playing as
   Amara, all the way back at level 1.
