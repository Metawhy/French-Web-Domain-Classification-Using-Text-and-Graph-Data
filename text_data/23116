When Secrecy is Better than Official Disclosure of Extraterrestrial Life

   Written by Dr Michael Salla on February 6, 2019. Posted in exopolitics
   activism, Featured

   Dr. Steven Greer, a leading figure in the UFO disclosure movement, has
   just proposed an audacious idea concerning official disclosure of
   extraterrestrial life. In his expert opinion, acquired over more than
   25 years of disclosure advocacy, continued secrecy is better than
   disclosing the truth about visiting aliens if they are depicted in any
   other way than peaceful nonviolent beings attempting to advance the
   evolution of human life on Earth.

   In the February 5 installment of Gaia TV’s Disclosure series, Greer was
   interviewed on the topic of the “Architecture of Secrecy” and explained
   his view about how official disclosure should be handled. He asserted
   his controversial idea that continued secrecy is better than any
   disclosure scenario that depicts extraterrestrials as in any way
   constituting a threat:

   My biggest concern is that there’s a hijacking of disclosure around a
   narrative of a threat, of an us versus them scenario. That is the sort
   of thing that can lead to the worst possible outcome.  I wrote a paper
   called “When Disclosure Serves Secrecy”. Disclosure that would serve
   the secret agenda is not something that we need. I’d rather have the
   secrecy continue, frankly. But a disclosure that would be truthful and
   would be forward looking, and that would have an interplanetary peace
   initiative, and communication and contact initiative, and that would
   have the release of these technologies for peaceful energy generation,
   transportation and what have you, that would transform the planet very
   quickly  (Video: 9:45)

   Greer explicitly referred to Luiz Elizondo and Dr. Hal Puthoff, who are
   senior figures in Tom DeLonge’s To The Stars Academy, as a major part
   of the threat scenario that is being currently put out into the public
   arena through the major news media. On that score, I would agree with
   Greer that the “Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program”
   (AATIP) which was created within the Defense Intelligence Agency in
   2007, and headed by Elizondo up to 2017, was unnecessarily framing the
   UFO issue in terms of it being a threat to national security.

   If Greer only limited himself to critiquing depictions of UFOs and all
   extraterrestrial visitors as a threat, which AATIP appeared to be
   doing, he would be on solid ground. However, Greer in the Disclosure
   interview, as well as in past public statements, made it clear that he
   is against researcher that depict any extraterrestrials, even if only a
   small percentage, as a threat in any way.

   On May 2, 2006, Greer launched an extraordinary public attack on my
   exopolitics research for having committed the egregious sin of
   proposing that extraterrestrials could in any way behave similarly to
   humans in terms of a wide range of motivations. My research dividing
   extraterrestrials into different motivational categories, e.g., the
   good, the bad and the indifferent, was lambasted by Greer as fueled by
   disinformation.

   Greer is no doubt correct that elements of the Military Industrial
   Complex are exaggerating the threat narrative when it comes to UFOs and
   extraterrestrial visitation, which AATIP appeared to be currently doing
   and which I acknowledged back in my 2006 response to Greer. In it,
   however, I also pointed out that Greer’s bold assertion that there is
   no evidence of hostile extraterrestrial behavior, can be easily shown
   to be wrong by examining multiple sources revealing the egregious
   behavior of some extraterrestrial visitors.

   On July 26, 2010, Greer was confronted by Project Camelot founders,
   Kerry Cassidy and Bill Ryan, over the same issue, and they presented
   their own evidentiary sources that some extraterrestrial visitors were
   behaving unethically and maliciously.

   IFRAME:
   https://www.youtube.com/embed/hzqDVOjtNhg?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide
   =2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent

   In 2018, Greer attacked two of the insider sources I have cited
   extensively in my secret space program book series, Corey Goode and
   William Tompkins, as putting out disinformation about aggressive
   extraterrestrials, Draconian Reptilians, who are described as a
   prominent part of the planetary control system. In this case, he
   speculated that both Goode and Tompkins were implanted with false
   memories and were unwittingly spreading disinformation.

   Again, I responded to Greer by pointing out the abundant evidence
   refuting his audacious assertion that no extraterrestrials behave in
   ways that are unethical or malicious. Indeed, I showed how his
   dismissal of Tompkins claims, in particular, ignored the impressive
   documentation substantiating his information.

   With that brief background on Greer’s past public statements on the
   issue of some, not all, extraterrestrials being unethical and
   malicious, the context has been set for better understanding the
   implications of what Greer had to say next in the February 5 interview.

   Greer repeated his assertion that continued secrecy is preferable to
   any official disclosure announcement describing aliens as a threat,
   even if only partially or a subset of the entire alien visitation
   scenario:

   The disclosure of this subject is the most important announcement in
   the history of the human race. How it’s handled, it has to be handled
   with great wisdom and great care. If it is handled with the kind of
   buffoonery and clumsiness that is evolving, or with partial truths,
   mixed in with disinformation, with frightening scenarios that scare the
   hell out of the public, I actually prefer the secrecy. (17:34)

   What makes Greer’s views significant is that he claims to be in touch
   with members of the oversight group of up to 200 members commonly
   referred to as the MAJIC committee. Greer asserts that he is providing
   them with an expert civilian perspective on disclosure, where,
   incredibly, he appears to be advocating continued secrecy if an
   official disclosure statement is not framed in the way he prescribes.

   In short, what is widely regarded as “full disclosure”, where all the
   facts and evidence of visiting extraterrestrials – good and bad – along
   with the truth about secret space programs is publicly revealed in an
   official announcement, is not supported by Greer. On the contrary, he
   only supports a “limited disclosure” statement where all references to
   unethical or malicious aliens is sanitized.

   It’s hard to envisage that a leading figure in the disclosure advocacy
   movement could support continued secrecy on any grounds, let alone the
   dubious grounds Greer asserts, which I and others have shown ignores a
   large body of evidence. As to why Greer is taking such an extreme
   position, there are a number of explanations that come to mind. One is
   that he is personally invested in a secret Vatican initiative to
   establish a “New Cosmic Esoteric World Religion” through a “false flag
   alien savior event” as described elsewhere. Another is that Greer has
   been co-opted or compromised by the MAJIC Committee in charge of
   extraterrestrial related projects and is sabotaging the disclosure
   movement by imposing unreasonable demands for a future official
   disclosure announcement.

   Greer’s position that continued secrecy is better than an official
   disclosure announcement which contains reference to any
   extraterrestrial visitors as a threat, is a position that he will find
   increasingly difficult to defend given the public’s growing awareness
   of all the available evidence of visiting aliens, and the diverse
   motivations behind their activities. Full disclosure is already well
   underway through multiple public initiatives  disclosing all aspects of
   visiting extraterrestrial life and secret space programs, and any
   effort to filter or curtail such information in ways favored by Greer,

Alien Disclosure – Amnesty – Book Review

   Written by Dr Michael Salla on October 9, 2018. Posted in Featured,
   galactic diplomacy, US Politics

   Alien Disclosure is a science fiction book based on a real-life event
   involving President Dwight Eisenhower meeting with an extraterrestrial
   delegation in February 1954. The author, Allan Kules, weaves a
   fascinating story of how a UFO researcher gets his hands on a copy of
   the film taken of the meeting, evades a secret government effort to
   capture him, and eventually takes it to the United Nations where it is
   played thereby disclosing the truth to the world.

   Available at Amazon.com

   The book’s plot provides an intriguing example of how full disclosure
   can be triggered by a positive faction of the secret government
   providing UFO/exopolitics researchers with leaked documents of real
   events. This first time this happened occurred in the 1980’s and 1990’s
   with the leaked Majestic Documents, and could easily happen again with
   a Wikileaks type release of UFO/extraterrestrial related documents.

   In Alien Disclosure, a positive secret government faction arranges for
   the Eisenhower film to be given to the hero, James Broadhurst, and this
   group helps him to evade a negative faction. He was chosen because of
   his firm belief that amnesty would need to be given to all those
   involved in maintaining the secrecy system.

   While on the run, Broadhurst gets to meet with human looking
   extraterrestrials that have infiltrated Earth society, who are also
   behind the full disclosure initiative. He also gets to witness some of
   the advanced technologies used by the secret government such as
   teleportation, and is taken for a ride on an extraterrestrial
   spacecraft.

   What I found especially helpful was the way the negative secret
   government faction was depicted. The villains were not dehumanized as
   psychopaths on a rampage of destruction as they carried out illegal
   orders, but as typical government agents with a highly skewed national
   security belief system that made them view extraterrestrial disclosure
   as a genuine threat for human society.

   This made it easier to understand why amnesty, based on the Truth and
   Reconciliation model used by countries such as South Africa, could be
   used in a full disclosure scenario. Amnesty is going to be a
   controversial topic as the full enormity of what has been kept secret,
   and how the secrecy system has been ruthlessly enforced for over seven
   decades is eventually disclosed.

   Kules’ book presents the pros and cons of an amnesty policy when it
   comes to full disclosure, and why amnesty is critical in getting the
   negative secret government faction to stand down. In our world today,
   there is little doubt that the advanced technologies possessed by the
   secret government could cause enormous destruction if unleashed by
   those backed into a corner with no other option.

   Yet, as we are seeing with the QAnon movement, there are over 50,000
   sealed indictments that have been issued against Deep State officials.
   The threat of being subjected to a military trial makes for a big
   motivator in getting cooperation from them. If QAnon is to be believed,
   the Deep State is on the verge of collapse, so why would blanket
   amnesty be necessary for the perpetrators of crimes stretching back
   decades?

   Would a “restorative justice” model based on Truth and Reconciliation
   be better than a “punitive justice” model in dealing with the complex
   legal and political issues raised by full disclosure? There are pros
   and cons with both models.

   In the case of the Truth and Reconciliation model used in South Africa,
   many felt that the truths revealed in the process helped bring closure
   to the victims and/or their families, while others believed that the
   perpetrators of atrocious crimes were treated far too leniently, and
   literally got away with murder.

   In the case of the Nuremburg War Crimes, while a few senior Nazi
   officials were punished, the vast majority escaped punishment since
   evidence was systematically destroyed, and/or such officials went
   underground to escape justice.

   I believe the answer lies in finding some balance between these two
   justice models since those responsible for the most egregious crimes
   should be exposed and punished as occurred at Nuremberg. Yet, it’s
   clear that in the vast majority of cases, where evidence is lacking, a
   Truth and Reconciliation process has clear advantages. Furthermore, we
   the victims of such crimes need to move on into a post-disclosure world
   and forgiveness appears to be an important rite of passage into what
   lies ahead.

   Kules’ book offers many insights into how the full disclosure process
   might play out, and how the world will react to the truth about
   extraterrestrial visitors, release of advanced technologies, and the
   exposure of those who brutally enforced the secrecy system.

   Alien Agenda is a very entertaining read, with lots of fascinating plot
   turns, and inspires the imagination to think about how full disclosure
   will happen – something that is vital to how it all eventually unfolds.

   On a personal level, I was gratified to see how my own research on the
   1954 Eisenhower extraterrestrial meeting inspired Kules to write his
   book. The meeting was a formative event in world history that has been
   largely ignored by UFO researchers. The multiple diplomatic meetings
   Eisenhower had with alien ambassadors throughout his administration has
   shaped the nature of U.S. and world politics ever since.

   One area that Kules’ book didn’t cover, is the existence of a German
   Secret Space Program operating out of Antarctica, which has morphed
   over the decades with corporate assistance into something quite
   sinister that operates in parallel with alien contact. Perhaps this is
   something he will cover later in his Alien Disclosure Trilogy.

   I highly recommend Alien Disclosure: Amnesty as a book well worth
   reading. It is available on Amazon as a paperback and would make an
   ideal gift for those interested in science fiction, and have an open
   mind to the truth about extraterrestrial visitation.
