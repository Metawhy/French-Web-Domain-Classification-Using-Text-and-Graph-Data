   ALICE project-team
   General objectives

   ALICE is one of the six teams of the  Algorithms, Computation, Geometry
   and Image Department in INRIA Nancy Grand-Est / Loria.

   ALICE is an INRIA project-team that aims at studying some fundamental
   aspects of Computer Graphics. More specifically, we study the
   interaction of light with the geometry of the objects. The lighting
   problem consists in designing accurate and efficient numerical
   simulation methods for the light transport equation. The geometrical
   problem consists in developing new solutions to transform and optimize
   geometric representations. Our original approach to both issues is to
   restate the problems in terms of numerical optimization. We try to
   develop solutions that are provably correct, scalable and numerically
   stable.
     * By provably correct, we mean that some properties/invariants of the
       initial object need to be preserved by our solutions.
     * By scalable, we mean that our solutions need to be applicable to
       data sets of industrial size.
     * By numerically stable, we mean that our solutions need to be
       resistant to the degeneracies often encountered in industrial data
       sets.

   To reach these goals, our approach consists in transforming the
   physical or geometric problem into a numerical optimization problem,
   studying the properties of the objective function and designing
   efficient minimization algorithms.

   Besides Computer Graphics, we have cooperations with researchers and
   people from the industry, who experiment applications of our general
   solutions to various domains, comprising CAD, industrial design, oil
   exploration, plasma physics... We collaborate with the Gocad consortium
   on 3D modeling for oil exploration.
