   To join, or not to joinâ€¦.THAT is the questions! No seriously, I get
   this question at least 5 times a day. So, today I wanted to share with
   you the THREE ways to enjoy Chalk Couture. But first, you might have
   ended up on this site and have no idea what Chalk Couture is. So, we
   have a little video to explain who we are and what we do:
   Hey everyone! Ken here with Ken's Kreations.
   In August of 2017, I was fortunate to attend the "Make Something You
   Love" event in Utah. At this event, Cricut announced some new products
   coming to the DIY movement. The BIG announcement was the introduction
   of the NEW Cricut Maker. At the time they announced the Cricut Maker,
   they shared the adaptive tool system which makes the Cricut
   Maker revolutionary!

   Hey everyone! Ken here with Ken's Kreations.
   In August of 2017, I was fortunate to attend the "Make Something You
   Love" event in Utah. At this event, Cricut announced some new products
   coming to the DIY movement. The BIG announcement was the introduction
   of the NEW Cricut Maker. At the time they announced the Cricut Maker,
   they shared the adaptive tool system which makes the Cricut
   Maker revolutionary! The first tool for the adaptive tool system was
   the Rotary Tool which gave the Cricut Maker the ability to cut through
   hundreds of different fabric material with amazing intricacy. But the
   tool that I had my eye on since the Cricut Maker launch was the Knife
   Blade. Well, today is the day that I finally get to test this amazing
   addition to the adaptive tool system. In today's post, we will cover
   what makes the knife blade different, give you 10 tips for beginners
   and also show you how to change the blade! All of this after the
   jump....

   Hey Everyone! Ken here with Ken's Kreations. I am so excited to share a
   great company, project and EXCLUSIVE COUPON CODE to one of my new
   favorite sties!
   SHOP HERE: https://visibleimage.co.uk/
   COUPON CODE: KKV15
   As I prepared to go to the 2018 Creativation, I started to inquire into
   new vendors that would be featuring product at the show. One vendor, in
   particular, caught my eye with their unique style. Visible
   Images featured a fresh new look for masculine stamps that I had been
   looking forward to for a while. I was very excited to make their booth
   one of my first stops. In this post, we will take a peek at their
   Creativation booth and I will walk you through one of my first projects
   featuring this amazing product line.

   Hey everyone! Ken here with Ken's Kreations!
   Many of you are aware that I like to change it up and use many
   different products in my craft room, so when Scrapbook.com reached out
   to me to review the Letter It-Line,  I jumped at the chance. A few
   weeks later I was delighted to see my USPS man delivered me some happy
   mail! Now even though these supplies were given to me by Scrapbook.com,
   they do not impact my overall review and comments! In today's post, I
   will show you both of the YouTube Video. One shows the entire line
   during an unboxing video and the other walks you through step-by-step
   on creating this anniversary card!
   [Anniversary%2BCard.jpg]

   Hey Everyone! Ken here with Ken's Kreations!
   Sometimes I actually make a card without
   going LIVE on Facebook or YouTube, which is kind of weird. However,
   some days I just need a retreat from the world, so I escape to my craft
   room and start crafting! When the new Fun Stampers Journey Catalog
   debuted I was drawn to two collections, in particular, one of those
   being Project Me. So as soon as I received this product I just knew I
   needed to make something of it. Here is what I came up with:
   [PROJECT%2BME.jpg]

   Hey Everyone! Ken here with Ken's Kreations.
   Many of you know that the reason I joined Fun Stampers Journey was
   based on their inks! I feel in love with not only their True Color
   Fusion Ink but also the amazing Color Splashes and Color Silks. As
   individuals join my Fun Stampers Journey Team I like to welcome them
   with a card. So in today's post, I wanted to share some of these cards
   and how I made them using Color Splashes and Color Silks!

   WIN A CRICUT EASY PRESS - SCROLL TO THE END OF THE REVIEW TO ENTER
   In August of 2017, I was fortunate to attend the "Make Something You
   Love" event in Utah. At this event, Cricut announced some new products
   coming to the DIY movement. The BIG announcement was the introduction
   of the NEW Cricut Maker. However, in the shadows was another product
   that would challenge everything we ever knew about household irons,
   bulky heat press and pressure. You see in the shadows of the Cricut
   Maker was a product that I knew would have the power to finally
   attract Silhouette Fans over to Cricut. Say hello to the Cricut
   EasyPress. In today's post, we will help you answer some of the
   questions I know you are already thinking of. Find out the answers
   after the jump.....
   [EASYPRESS%2B.jpg]

   Hey everyone! Ken here with Ken's Kreations!
   Sometimes not ALL occasions are celebrations. I have found at times the
   hardest cards to make are the ones where we are at a loss for words. I
   often hear this with Sympathy cards, as many people struggle with
   making this cards. One of these occasions that I see often is the
   struggle for many women to conceive a child.  How do you make a card
   for that? Well, recently I have discovered the amazing stamps over
   at Lawn Fawn and they had the PERFECT set for this type of card. Let's
   take a look at how to make this card in today's post!

   Hey everyone! Ken here with Ken's Kreations.
   So as many of you are, I am a huge fan of Tim Holtz. When Tim
   Holtz released the Crazy Series (dog, Bird, Cat, etc) I fell in love.
   Well, this year he shared with us the Hipster Animal Set, which at
   first I was not a fan of. However, this quickly changed when I saw the
   amazing things being created online. Today I am proud to show you my
   FIRST creation with these stamps.

   Hey everyone! Ken here with Ken's Kreations.
   Well, many of you know that I went to the 2017 Creativation. Here I was
   introduced to the company Nuvo by tonic studios. One of the products I
   instantly fell in love with was the Nuvo Mousse. So naturally, I wanted
   to use this amazing product in a project and show how to use it during
   one of my LIVE YouTube Videos. So let's take a look at the card, the
   supplies I needed to make the card and of course the video showing you
   how to put it all together!

   Hey, Everyone! Ken here with Ken's Kreations!
   In August of 2017, Cricut invited creators, bloggers, and fans to their
   Cricut Make-A-Thon. At this event, CEO, Ashish Arora announced new
   products that Cricut had been working on over the past three years. The
   big products they announced were the BrightPad, Easy Press and the
   revolutionary Cricut Maker Machine. In today's blog post we are going
   to focus on the Cricut Maker Machine. What is this machine? Why is
   every blogger talking about it, and should you upgrade your current
   machine? In today's post, we help you answer ALL of these questions!

   Hey, everyone! Ken here with Ken's Kreations and I am so excited to
   share today's project with all of you!
   Sometimes inspiration comes from just about anywhere. When planning
   my LIVE Make-It-Monday project, I knew I wanted to feature some
   Halloween items, but not sure what I wanted to do. That was until I was
   looking at Pinterest and came across an old school grocery shopping bag
   featuring Halloween images. And just like that, I knew EXACTLY what I
   wanted to create.
