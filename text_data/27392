   Written by Lead Bartender & Bar Manager (Former Employee) from
   Doylestown, PA on 7 August 2018
   The restaurant and bar were great. The kitchen was great. All employees
   worked well together. But the management was poor. Uninterested in
   approving and taking an interest at the end. Gave up!

   Average custodian bank with low pay
   Written by Customer Service (Current Employee) from Sydney NSW on 21
   November 2018
   Overall not an unpleasant place to work but they have a pretty rigid
   pay structure that means they fail to hire of retain the best
   performers. Decision making all done through Paris, poor on technology
   and support of global systems.
   Pros
   Steady employer, unlikely to be fired
   Cons
   Low pay, slow moving on projects

   Impressive corporate for first intern
   Internship (Former Employee) –  Sydney CBD – 24 March 2015
   BNP offers me task to process and update data on a daily basis along
   with adhoc tasks from my supervisor.
   During the internship, I learned the ability to work until pressure and
   finish on time the assignment.
   Many friendly colleagues at similar age to mine therefore support me
   with all their heart
   There is no tough part as it is my first internship, I find myself very
   lucky.
   Sometimes our team had afternoon tea or we hanged out together at
   weekend.
