Pecan Maple Cookies with Maple Glaze

   October 2, 2019 | 1 Comment »

   These Maple Cookies are studded with pecans and topped with an
   irresistible maple glaze! The cookies are unique because they are more
   like a scone than a traditional cookie, plus they have raw sugar in
   them for even more texture. It’s the perfect cookie to satisfy all your
   fall baking needs!

   You know what is the cruelest thing in the world? When you put books 2
   and 3 from the series you’re reading on hold at the library, and they
   loan you number 3 before number 2. How unfair is that??

   It’s the sequel to the book that is now a movie on Netflix, To All the
   Boys I Loved Before. Have you seen it? It’s a cute teenage romance
   movie, and the books are very similar.

   I needed some light reading for our plane ride to Japan, Eric and I
   just got home! It was so fun. My best friend Sarah and her husband (who
   is in the Air Force) have been living there for two years, and we’ve
   been wanting to visit them. We figured if we’re ever going to go to
   Japan, now is the time to do it, when we have built in tour guides!

   It was so much fun seeing Tokyo and Kyoto. My favorite was seeing all
   the moss covered shrines. Who am I kidding, my favorite was actually
   seeing all the street fashion. How do Japanese girls look so cool
   wearing socks and sandals? I’m not even kidding, it is totally a thing
   there and it looked awesome on them. Probably because they all have
   tiny feet. If I tried that people would be completely disgusted my size
   nines.

   Here’s one of my favorite authentic Japanese meals we had. I’m not
   really into Japanese food (I mean, besides the million flavors of Kit
   Kats and Hi Chews) and sushi is definitely not my favorite. But I had
   tempura (which is Deep Fried Things) and we got along just fine.
