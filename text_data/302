NASDAQ, INC., AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES PRIVACY POLICY

   Effective Date: May 25, 2018

   As a global financial services and technology provider and
   self-regulatory organization, Nasdaq is committed to protecting
   Personal Information and complying with applicable privacy requirements
   in a trustworthy, transparent and responsible manner.

   This Privacy Policy describes how Nasdaq, Inc. and its subsidiaries and
   affiliates (collectively, “Nasdaq,” “we,” “our” or “us”) collects, uses
   and discloses Personal Information about individuals (collectively,
   “users” or “you”) receiving our products and services, exploring or
   maintaining a business relationship with us (either directly or through
   an intermediary such as your financial services provider, your
   appointed legal or other representative or your employer) and/or using
   our websites or online features (each a “Site” or collectively, our
   “Sites”). As used in this Privacy Policy, Personal Information means
   any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural
   person; Personal Information is intended to cover all information
   subject to personal data processing and privacy laws applicable to our
   business.

   Without limiting the generality of the preceding paragraph, this
   Privacy Policy applies to all Personal Information provided to Nasdaq’s
   European exchanges (namely, Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S, Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd,
   Nasdaq Iceland hf., Nasdaq Oslo A/S, Nasdaq Riga AS, Nasdaq Stockholm
   AB, Nasdaq Tallinn AS and AB Nasdaq Vilnius), the clearinghouse Nasdaq
   Clearing AB, central shares depositories (namely, Nasdaq CSD SE and
   Nasdaq CSD Iceland hf.), AB Pensionkeskus, and the
   broker-dealer/investment firm Nasdaq Broker Services AB (collectively,
   our “EEA Regulated Entities”) subject only to the exclusions from this
   policy set forth below.

   The Privacy Policy also describes your rights, where applicable, and
   how to exercise them. You may contact us at any time with questions
   related to our Personal Information processing and privacy via email
   at privacy@nasdaq.com.

   In some instances, we may post or provide materials that provide
   further description of Personal Information processing related to
   certain products and services. We may also post information about how
   we comply with specific Personal Information laws or regulations like
   European Union or United States privacy laws. Such materials are for
   informational purposes only and are not intended as an exhaustive
   listing of Personal Information processing related to the product and
   service. The materials should not be construed as modifying this
   Privacy Policy.

BRIEF OVERVIEW


INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THIS POLICY APPLIES TO OUR GLOBAL COMPANY

   As a global organization, different Nasdaq entities, products/services
   and Sites may be subject to different privacy laws based on where our
   entity operates, where the products/services are delivered and/or where
   you are located. For example, the European Union General Data
   Protection Regulation imposes certain requirements on some Nasdaq
   entities or services that are not applicable to all of our entities or
   services. Where this Privacy Policy states that a provision applies “to
   the extent required by applicable law,” such provision will be
   applicable only to the extent that Nasdaq is subject to legal
   requirements imposing it.

   For purposes of data protection laws, except where this Privacy Policy
   does not apply, as described below, the Nasdaq entity that will be the
   “controller” of your Personal Information will be the entity that
   delivers the products or services you (or the company for whom you are
   working or have a business relationship) are receiving or maintains the
   Site that you are using. You can identify the Nasdaq company that hosts
   a particular Site through the Site’s footer or “About” link. A list of
   Nasdaq’s different business locations is available here.

   Although your data controller may be a specific Nasdaq entity, contact
   and other customer relationship information that we collect may be held
   in a customer relationship management or contact database which can be
   accessed by other Nasdaq entities which may be located globally;
   further information about international transfers of information is
   provided below. To the extent required or permitted by applicable law,
   by visiting or using our Sites, you are consenting to us collecting and
   processing information about you in accordance with this Privacy
   Policy.


SITUATIONS WHERE THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES NOT APPLY


   This Privacy Policy also does not apply to Personal Information
   processed in connection with delivery of services to Nasdaq by
   suppliers or contractors; such relationships are governed solely by the
   Personal Information processing terms and conditions between Nasdaq and
   the supplier/contractor. It also does not apply to job applicants or
   employees, which are subject to relevant privacy notices.

   This Privacy Policy does not apply to the extent that:
     * Nasdaq’s contract for delivery of products or service prescribes
       different Personal Information terms and conditions for the
       processing of your information;
     * Nasdaq is delivering products or services as a data processor in
       which the contractual terms and conditions between Nasdaq and the
       controller/contracting party shall govern;
     * The Site for the products or services sets forth an additional or
       alternative Privacy Policy; or
     * Applicable law imposes different processing or privacy requirements
       on your information.

   With respect to situations where we process Personal Information based
   on our legitimate business interest, reflecting that we are generally a
   business-to-business product and service provider, we typically collect
   and process limited Personal Information about corporate customer
   points of contact and individuals acting in their professional
   capacities as part of our overall effect to reduce the privacy impact
   on individuals. To the extent required by applicable law, you have the
   right to object to the processing of your personal data based on a
   legitimate interest as legal basis. Please see the section below
   regarding your rights to find out more. Where processing is based on
   your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.

AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING

   Nasdaq does not engage decision-making based solely on automated
   processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects
   concerning an individual or similarly significantly affects an
   individual.

   As part of Nasdaq’s surveillance programs for its exchanges, we utilize
   certain software that uses machine intelligence and learning to
   identify situations that potentially constitute market abuse, insider
   trading, fraud or violations of our published rules. Such software
   relies on identifying patterns indicating misconduct based on past
   activity. The conduct involved may include conduct by a corporate
   member, trading algorithm or individual action. Alerts are referred for
   investigation by our Surveillance team which determines which actions
   to take based on our published rules and applicable law.

HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION

   From time to time, to the extent permitted by applicable law and
   subject to any contractual limitations on sharing Personal Information
   set forth in a relevant contract for products and services, we may
   share your information with our affiliates, subsidiaries, business
   partners, customers/members (such as where we process your Personal
   Information in connection with your role with your employer or
   financial services provider), third party service providers and
   authorities in the following circumstances:
     * Nasdaq Business Units, Affiliates, Subsidiaries, Business Partners
       and Customers. We may share your information with our business
       units, affiliates, subsidiaries, business partners, and customers
       in the US and worldwide for purposes identified above. A list of
       Nasdaq’s offices by country is posted here. To the extent required
       or permitted by applicable law, by visiting or using our Sites or
       otherwise providing us with your information, you consent to this
       sharing of your information. Where such consent exists, to opt-out
       of such sharing, please contact us via email
       at privacy@nasdaq.com or at the location in the Contact Us section
       below.
     * Service Providers. We may share your information with third parties
       who perform functions on our behalf (e.g., hosting or operating our
       services or Sites, processing credit card payments, sending email
       marketing communications, or data analysis). We do not authorize
       these third parties to use your information for purposes other than
       for which it has been provided, and do not authorize these third
       parties to disclose that information to unauthorized parties. We
       require these third parties to maintain appropriate security to
       protect your information from unauthorized access or processing.
     * As Required or Appropriate by Law. We may disclose your information
       to regulatory authorities, courts, and government agencies where we
       believe that doing so would be in accordance with or permitted or
       required by any applicable law, regulation or legal process, to
       defend the interests, rights, and/or property of Nasdaq or others,
       or to respond to emergencies.
     * Business Transfers. We may transfer your information to a third
       party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint
       venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any
       portion of our business, brands, affiliates, subsidiaries or other
       assets. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may share
       information with a prospective buyer or transferee of the business
       as part of the diligence process provided that we require any such
       third party to maintain the confidentiality of your information and
       protect it with appropriate technical and organizational security
       measures.

   We may share your information with other parties as directed by you or
   subject to your consent. We may also share and otherwise process
   aggregated information or de-identified information that does not
   identify you individually with other parties. For example, from time to
   time, we may utilize survey information collected from you on an
   aggregate, not individually identifiable, basis. We also use this
   aggregated or de-identified information for our various business
   purposes, including the creation and sale of other products and
   services to our clients and potential clients. This aggregate or
   de-identified information is not traceable to any particular client or
   user and will not be used by a third party to contact you.

   We do not share, sell, rent or trade your information to our service
   providers or business partners for their own direct marketing purposes,
   unless we have explicitly given you the option to opt-in or opt-out of
   such disclosures.

MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS

   We process Personal Information within the scope of our marketing and
   market segmentation. With market segmentation, we mean that we
   categorize our customer base based on professional affiliations and
   functions, alignment with our services and products and information
   gathered from public sources of information. For customers or users of
   our Sites, we may also use information gathered from your use of our
   products, services and/or Sites for marketing purposes. You always have
   right to request that we stop using your personal data for direct
   marketing purposes.

   To the extent required by applicable law, you have the right to object
   to the processing of your personal data based on a legitimate interest
   as legal basis. You also always have the right to withdraw your consent
   at any time when we need your consent in order to process your personal
   data. If you withdraw your consent, you will no longer receive
   information and offers that are tailored for you. Please see the
   section below for more information about your rights.

   If you no longer wish to receive marketing communications from us, you
   may opt-out of receiving marketing-related emails by: (1) using the
   unsubscribe method provided in our communications; (2) if you created
   an online account when you registered to receive our emails, you may
   log-in to your account on the applicable Site and make changes to your
   communication preferences; or (3) you can opt out by updating your
   preferences in the Email Alert section of our Sites. In particular, you
   have the right to object our use of your personal information for
   direct marketing and in certain other situations (in accordance with
   applicable law) by contacting us at privacy@nasdaq.com. If you are
   having difficulty unsubscribing from our email marketing communications
   using the above methods, please contact us as at privacy@nasdaq.com.

   We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably
   practicable as required by applicable law. Please note that we may need
   to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes, to complete
   any transactions that you began prior to your request, or for other
   purposes as required or permitted by applicable law. In addition,
   please note that even if you opt-out of receiving marketing
   communications from one or all of our Sites, we may need to send you
   service-related communications.

YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

   To the extent required by applicable law, in our capacity as the
   controller of your Personal Information, we will also provide you with
   the opportunity to be informed of whether we are processing your
   Personal Information and at any time to access, correct, update,
   oppose, delete, block, limit or object to our use of your Personal
   Information. The foregoing rights will be afforded to you free of
   charge (except to the extent that your requests are manifestly
   unfounded or excessive, in which case, we may charge an administrative
   fee or refuse to meet your request). Please note that legal obligations
   that apply to our business – for example, financial regulations that
   apply to our EEA Regulated Business - may prevent us from immediately
   deleting parts of your information. To exercise your rights, please
   contact us as detailed under the Contact Us heading below.

   To prevent fraudulent activity, we may require you to authenticate your
   identity when you contact us. We will try to comply with your request
   as soon as reasonably practicable and within timeframes required by
   applicable law. Please note that in some instances, due to the nature
   of the information that we receive, we may require you to provide
   additional information that will help us identify which information is
   yours. For requests subject to the European General Data Protection
   Regulation, we will respond to your request within one month of our
   receipt of it. We may extend this period by two further months taking
   into account the complexity of your request or the number of requests
   that we have received; we will inform you of any such extension within
   one month of receiving your request along with the reasons for the
   delay and information about your right to file a complaint with the
   supervisory authority.

   The following sets out a summary of your rights to the extent that your
   Personal Information is processed subject to the European General Data
   Protection Regulation:
     * Right to access, rectification, erasure and restriction of
       processing. You have the right to request:
          + Access to your personal data. This means that you have the
            right to request information on our use of your Personal
            Information. You also have the right to request a copy of the
            Personal Information being processed at no cost. However, we
            may charge you a reasonable administrative fee to provide you
            with additional copies of the Personal Information. If you
            make your access request by electronic means such as email, we
            will provide you with the information in a commonly used
            electronic format.
          + Rectification of your personal data. We will at your request,
            or at our own initiative, rectify, anonymise, erase or
            complement Personal Information that you or we discover is
            inaccurate, incomplete or misleading. You also have the right
            to complete the Personal Information with additional data if
            relevant information is missing.
          + Erasure of your personal data. You have the right to request
            that we erase your Personal Information if we do no longer
            have an acceptable reason for processing the data. Given this,
            erasure shall be made by us if:
          + the Personal Information is no longer necessary for the
            purposes for which it was collected,
          + we use your Personal Information with your consent and you
            withdraw your consent,
          + you object to the processing of your Personal Information
            based on our legitimate interest and there is no overriding
            legitimate ground for the processing,
          + the Personal Information has not been lawfully processed,
          + we are required to erase the Personal Information due to a
            legal obligation, or
          + you are a child and we have collected the personal data in
            relation to the offer of information society services.

   However, there might be requirements under applicable law, or other
   compelling reasons, that prevents us from immediately erasing your
   Personal Information. In such case, we will stop using your Personal
   Information for any other reasons than to comply with the applicable
   law, or the relevant compelling reason.
     * Right to restrict processing: This means that we temporarily
       restrict the processing of your Personal Information. You have the
       right to request restriction of the processing when:
          + you have requested rectification of your personal data in
            accordance with this Privacy Policy, during the period of time
            we are verifying the accuracy of the data,
          + the processing is unlawful and you do not want the Personal
            Information to be erased,
          + as data controller, we no longer need the Personal Information
            for the purposes for which it was collected, but you require
            us to retain the information for the establishment, exercise
            or defence of legal claims, or
          + you have objected to our legitimate interest for the
            processing in accordance with this Privacy Policy, during the
            period of time we determine whether the legitimate interest
            overrides your privacy rights.

   We will take all reasonable and possible actions to notify any
   recipients of your Personal Information regarding any rectification,
   erasure or restrictions carried out by us. At your request, we will
   also inform you with which third parties we have shared your Personal
   Information.
     * Right to object to processing. You have the right to object to the
       processing of your Personal Information based on our legitimate
       interest. If you object to such processing, we will only continue
       with the processing if we have a compelling legitimate reason for
       the processing that outweighs your interest, rights or freedoms, or
       if continued processing is necessary for the establishment,
       exercise or defence of a legal claim.
     * Right to portability. You have the right to receive certain of your
       Personal Information in a structured, commonly used and
       machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data
       to another controller. You only have this right when your personal
       data is processed by automated means and our legal basis for the
       processing is performance of a contract between you and us.
     * Right to lodge a complaint. You have the right to lodge any
       complaints regarding our processing of your personal data with the
       supervisory authority.

SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION

   We take reasonable technical, administrative and physical security
   measures to protect your information, including applying generally
   accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us
   during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of
   transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100%
   secure, so we unfortunately cannot guarantee absolute security. If you
   have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer
   secure (e.g., if you feel that the security of any account you might
   have with us has been compromised), please contact us immediately as
   detailed under the “Contact Us” heading below.

INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS

   Some of the parties with which we may share your information, as
   detailed in “How We Share Your Information”, may be located in
   countries that do not provide an equivalent level of protection as your
   home country. Where required, Nasdaq has implemented appropriate
   cross-border transfer solutions to provide adequate protection for
   transfers of certain personal information, including, but not limited
   to, the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (available
   at https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfe
   rs-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en
   ). To the extent permitted by applicable law, by using our Sites, and
   providing us information about you, you consent to the international
   transfer of information about you to the above parties.

RETENTION OF YOUR INFORMATION

   We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the
   purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and as otherwise needed to
   comply with applicable law and recordkeeping requirements or to address
   any complaints, challenges, legal or compliance matters related to the
   information.

COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES

   When you use our Sites, we along with our affiliates, subsidiaries and
   third party service providers may use “cookies” and similar
   technologies (e.g., log files, clear gifs, pixel tags and Flash LSOs)
   (collectively, “technology”). This technology may involve placing small
   files/code on your device or browser that serve a number of purposes,
   such as remembering your preferences (e.g., language) and generally
   improving your experience on our Sites. Specifically, we may use such
   technology for purposes such as to:
     * Provide us with general analytics about our Sites, including
       demographic information in a non-identifiable form, in order to
       improve our Sites’ performance and customize users’ experience;
     * Enable us to help you make better use of our services or Sites such
       as by suggesting how you can improve your use of different features
       or functionality or help address technical issues that you
       encounter in using our services or Sites;
     * Support security measures, such as requiring re-login into your
       account or additional authentication when using a new device to
       access our Sites;
     * Measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile
       statistics about the Site’s usage and email response rates;
     * Allow you to engage in our social media offerings on our Sites
       (e.g., Facebook “Like” button and LinkedIn integration); and
     * More effectively market our Sites and advertise other Sites that
       may be of interest to you.

   To learn more about the technology used on our Sites and how to disable
   some of the technology, visit our more comprehensive Cookie Statement.

REFERRALS

   If you choose to use our referral service to tell someone about our
   products or services or Sites, we will ask you for your friend’s name
   and email address. We will send your referral a one-time email to
   invite him/her to access the Site or with information about the product
   or service, and store his/her email address for the sole purpose of
   sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral
   program. Your referral may contact us as detailed under the “Contact
   Us” heading below to request we remove this information from our
   database.

LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES

   Our Sites may contain links to other websites or services that are not
   owned or controlled by Nasdaq, including links to websites of our
   advertisers, sponsors and partners. This Privacy Policy only applies to
   information collected by our Sites. We have no control over these third
   party websites, and your use of third party websites and features are
   subject to privacy policies posted on those websites. We are not
   responsible or liable for the privacy or business practices of any
   third party websites linked to our Sites. Your use of third parties’
   websites linked to our Sites is at your own risk, so we encourage you
   to read the privacy policies of any linked third party websites when
   you leave one of our Sites.

   We may use third party payment services to process purchases made
   through the Sites. If such service is made available and you wish to
   make a purchase through the Site, your Personal Information may be
   collected by the third party (and not by us). In that case, the
   information you provide to the third party will be subject to that
   third party’s privacy policy and not this Privacy Policy.

USE OF SITES BY CHILDREN

   None of our Sites are targeted for use by children under the age of
   sixteen. We do not target any of our products or services or Site
   content/features for use by children of such age.

CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

   Except to the extent limited by applicable law, we reserve the right to
   update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information
   practices by prominently posting notice of the update on our Sites.
   Unless otherwise noted, any updates will become effective 30 days after
   posting the updates to the Privacy Policy, and apply to all information
   collected about you. If we make any changes to this Privacy Policy that
   materially impact previously collected information about you, we will,
   to the extent that we have your email address, notify you by email.

NASDAQ, INC., AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES PRIVACY POLICY

   Effective Date: May 25, 2018

   As a global financial services and technology provider and
   self-regulatory organization, Nasdaq is committed to protecting
   Personal Information and complying with applicable privacy requirements
   in a trustworthy, transparent and responsible manner.

   This Privacy Policy describes how Nasdaq, Inc. and its subsidiaries and
   affiliates (collectively, “Nasdaq,” “we,” “our” or “us”) collects, uses
   and discloses Personal Information about individuals (collectively,
   “users” or “you”) receiving our products and services, exploring or
   maintaining a business relationship with us (either directly or through
   an intermediary such as your financial services provider, your
   appointed legal or other representative or your employer) and/or using
   our websites or online features (each a “Site” or collectively, our
   “Sites”). As used in this Privacy Policy, Personal Information means
   any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural
   person; Personal Information is intended to cover all information
   subject to personal data processing and privacy laws applicable to our
   business.

   Without limiting the generality of the preceding paragraph, this
   Privacy Policy applies to all Personal Information provided to Nasdaq’s
   European exchanges (namely, Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S, Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd,
   Nasdaq Iceland hf., Nasdaq Oslo A/S, Nasdaq Riga AS, Nasdaq Stockholm
   AB, Nasdaq Tallinn AS and AB Nasdaq Vilnius), the clearinghouse Nasdaq
   Clearing AB, central shares depositories (namely, Nasdaq CSD SE and
   Nasdaq CSD Iceland hf.), AB Pensionkeskus, and the
   broker-dealer/investment firm Nasdaq Broker Services AB (collectively,
   our “EEA Regulated Entities”) subject only to the exclusions from this
   policy set forth below.

   The Privacy Policy also describes your rights, where applicable, and
   how to exercise them. You may contact us at any time with questions
   related to our Personal Information processing and privacy via email
   at privacy@nasdaq.com.

   In some instances, we may post or provide materials that provide
   further description of Personal Information processing related to
   certain products and services. We may also post information about how
   we comply with specific Personal Information laws or regulations like
   European Union or United States privacy laws. Such materials are for
   informational purposes only and are not intended as an exhaustive
   listing of Personal Information processing related to the product and
   service. The materials should not be construed as modifying this
   Privacy Policy.

BRIEF OVERVIEW


INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THIS POLICY APPLIES TO OUR GLOBAL COMPANY

   As a global organization, different Nasdaq entities, products/services
   and Sites may be subject to different privacy laws based on where our
   entity operates, where the products/services are delivered and/or where
   you are located. For example, the European Union General Data
   Protection Regulation imposes certain requirements on some Nasdaq
   entities or services that are not applicable to all of our entities or
   services. Where this Privacy Policy states that a provision applies “to
   the extent required by applicable law,” such provision will be
   applicable only to the extent that Nasdaq is subject to legal
   requirements imposing it.

   For purposes of data protection laws, except where this Privacy Policy
   does not apply, as described below, the Nasdaq entity that will be the
   “controller” of your Personal Information will be the entity that
   delivers the products or services you (or the company for whom you are
   working or have a business relationship) are receiving or maintains the
   Site that you are using. You can identify the Nasdaq company that hosts
   a particular Site through the Site’s footer or “About” link. A list of
   Nasdaq’s different business locations is available here.

   Although your data controller may be a specific Nasdaq entity, contact
   and other customer relationship information that we collect may be held
   in a customer relationship management or contact database which can be
   accessed by other Nasdaq entities which may be located globally;
   further information about international transfers of information is
   provided below. To the extent required or permitted by applicable law,
   by visiting or using our Sites, you are consenting to us collecting and
   processing information about you in accordance with this Privacy
   Policy.


SITUATIONS WHERE THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES NOT APPLY


   This Privacy Policy also does not apply to Personal Information
   processed in connection with delivery of services to Nasdaq by
   suppliers or contractors; such relationships are governed solely by the
   Personal Information processing terms and conditions between Nasdaq and
   the supplier/contractor. It also does not apply to job applicants or
   employees, which are subject to relevant privacy notices.

   This Privacy Policy does not apply to the extent that:
     * Nasdaq’s contract for delivery of products or service prescribes
       different Personal Information terms and conditions for the
       processing of your information;
     * Nasdaq is delivering products or services as a data processor in
       which the contractual terms and conditions between Nasdaq and the
       controller/contracting party shall govern;
     * The Site for the products or services sets forth an additional or
       alternative Privacy Policy; or
     * Applicable law imposes different processing or privacy requirements
       on your information.

   With respect to situations where we process Personal Information based
   on our legitimate business interest, reflecting that we are generally a
   business-to-business product and service provider, we typically collect
   and process limited Personal Information about corporate customer
   points of contact and individuals acting in their professional
   capacities as part of our overall effect to reduce the privacy impact
   on individuals. To the extent required by applicable law, you have the
   right to object to the processing of your personal data based on a
   legitimate interest as legal basis. Please see the section below
   regarding your rights to find out more. Where processing is based on
   your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.

AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING

   Nasdaq does not engage decision-making based solely on automated
   processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects
   concerning an individual or similarly significantly affects an
   individual.

   As part of Nasdaq’s surveillance programs for its exchanges, we utilize
   certain software that uses machine intelligence and learning to
   identify situations that potentially constitute market abuse, insider
   trading, fraud or violations of our published rules. Such software
   relies on identifying patterns indicating misconduct based on past
   activity. The conduct involved may include conduct by a corporate
   member, trading algorithm or individual action. Alerts are referred for
   investigation by our Surveillance team which determines which actions
   to take based on our published rules and applicable law.

HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION

   From time to time, to the extent permitted by applicable law and
   subject to any contractual limitations on sharing Personal Information
   set forth in a relevant contract for products and services, we may
   share your information with our affiliates, subsidiaries, business
   partners, customers/members (such as where we process your Personal
   Information in connection with your role with your employer or
   financial services provider), third party service providers and
   authorities in the following circumstances:
     * Nasdaq Business Units, Affiliates, Subsidiaries, Business Partners
       and Customers. We may share your information with our business
       units, affiliates, subsidiaries, business partners, and customers
       in the US and worldwide for purposes identified above. A list of
       Nasdaq’s offices by country is posted here. To the extent required
       or permitted by applicable law, by visiting or using our Sites or
       otherwise providing us with your information, you consent to this
       sharing of your information. Where such consent exists, to opt-out
       of such sharing, please contact us via email
       at privacy@nasdaq.com or at the location in the Contact Us section
       below.
     * Service Providers. We may share your information with third parties
       who perform functions on our behalf (e.g., hosting or operating our
       services or Sites, processing credit card payments, sending email
       marketing communications, or data analysis). We do not authorize
       these third parties to use your information for purposes other than
       for which it has been provided, and do not authorize these third
       parties to disclose that information to unauthorized parties. We
       require these third parties to maintain appropriate security to
       protect your information from unauthorized access or processing.
     * As Required or Appropriate by Law. We may disclose your information
       to regulatory authorities, courts, and government agencies where we
       believe that doing so would be in accordance with or permitted or
       required by any applicable law, regulation or legal process, to
       defend the interests, rights, and/or property of Nasdaq or others,
       or to respond to emergencies.
     * Business Transfers. We may transfer your information to a third
       party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint
       venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any
       portion of our business, brands, affiliates, subsidiaries or other
       assets. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may share
       information with a prospective buyer or transferee of the business
       as part of the diligence process provided that we require any such
       third party to maintain the confidentiality of your information and
       protect it with appropriate technical and organizational security
       measures.

   We may share your information with other parties as directed by you or
   subject to your consent. We may also share and otherwise process
   aggregated information or de-identified information that does not
   identify you individually with other parties. For example, from time to
   time, we may utilize survey information collected from you on an
   aggregate, not individually identifiable, basis. We also use this
   aggregated or de-identified information for our various business
   purposes, including the creation and sale of other products and
   services to our clients and potential clients. This aggregate or
   de-identified information is not traceable to any particular client or
   user and will not be used by a third party to contact you.

   We do not share, sell, rent or trade your information to our service
   providers or business partners for their own direct marketing purposes,
   unless we have explicitly given you the option to opt-in or opt-out of
   such disclosures.

MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS

   We process Personal Information within the scope of our marketing and
   market segmentation. With market segmentation, we mean that we
   categorize our customer base based on professional affiliations and
   functions, alignment with our services and products and information
   gathered from public sources of information. For customers or users of
   our Sites, we may also use information gathered from your use of our
   products, services and/or Sites for marketing purposes. You always have
   right to request that we stop using your personal data for direct
   marketing purposes.

   To the extent required by applicable law, you have the right to object
   to the processing of your personal data based on a legitimate interest
   as legal basis. You also always have the right to withdraw your consent
   at any time when we need your consent in order to process your personal
   data. If you withdraw your consent, you will no longer receive
   information and offers that are tailored for you. Please see the
   section below for more information about your rights.

   If you no longer wish to receive marketing communications from us, you
   may opt-out of receiving marketing-related emails by: (1) using the
   unsubscribe method provided in our communications; (2) if you created
   an online account when you registered to receive our emails, you may
   log-in to your account on the applicable Site and make changes to your
   communication preferences; or (3) you can opt out by updating your
   preferences in the Email Alert section of our Sites. In particular, you
   have the right to object our use of your personal information for
   direct marketing and in certain other situations (in accordance with
   applicable law) by contacting us at privacy@nasdaq.com. If you are
   having difficulty unsubscribing from our email marketing communications
   using the above methods, please contact us as at privacy@nasdaq.com.

   We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably
   practicable as required by applicable law. Please note that we may need
   to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes, to complete
   any transactions that you began prior to your request, or for other
   purposes as required or permitted by applicable law. In addition,
   please note that even if you opt-out of receiving marketing
   communications from one or all of our Sites, we may need to send you
   service-related communications.

YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

   To the extent required by applicable law, in our capacity as the
   controller of your Personal Information, we will also provide you with
   the opportunity to be informed of whether we are processing your
   Personal Information and at any time to access, correct, update,
   oppose, delete, block, limit or object to our use of your Personal
   Information. The foregoing rights will be afforded to you free of
   charge (except to the extent that your requests are manifestly
   unfounded or excessive, in which case, we may charge an administrative
   fee or refuse to meet your request). Please note that legal obligations
   that apply to our business – for example, financial regulations that
   apply to our EEA Regulated Business - may prevent us from immediately
   deleting parts of your information. To exercise your rights, please
   contact us as detailed under the Contact Us heading below.

   To prevent fraudulent activity, we may require you to authenticate your
   identity when you contact us. We will try to comply with your request
   as soon as reasonably practicable and within timeframes required by
   applicable law. Please note that in some instances, due to the nature
   of the information that we receive, we may require you to provide
   additional information that will help us identify which information is
   yours. For requests subject to the European General Data Protection
   Regulation, we will respond to your request within one month of our
   receipt of it. We may extend this period by two further months taking
   into account the complexity of your request or the number of requests
   that we have received; we will inform you of any such extension within
   one month of receiving your request along with the reasons for the
   delay and information about your right to file a complaint with the
   supervisory authority.

   The following sets out a summary of your rights to the extent that your
   Personal Information is processed subject to the European General Data
   Protection Regulation:
     * Right to access, rectification, erasure and restriction of
       processing. You have the right to request:
          + Access to your personal data. This means that you have the
            right to request information on our use of your Personal
            Information. You also have the right to request a copy of the
            Personal Information being processed at no cost. However, we
            may charge you a reasonable administrative fee to provide you
            with additional copies of the Personal Information. If you
            make your access request by electronic means such as email, we
            will provide you with the information in a commonly used
            electronic format.
          + Rectification of your personal data. We will at your request,
            or at our own initiative, rectify, anonymise, erase or
            complement Personal Information that you or we discover is
            inaccurate, incomplete or misleading. You also have the right
            to complete the Personal Information with additional data if
            relevant information is missing.
          + Erasure of your personal data. You have the right to request
            that we erase your Personal Information if we do no longer
            have an acceptable reason for processing the data. Given this,
            erasure shall be made by us if:
          + the Personal Information is no longer necessary for the
            purposes for which it was collected,
          + we use your Personal Information with your consent and you
            withdraw your consent,
          + you object to the processing of your Personal Information
            based on our legitimate interest and there is no overriding
            legitimate ground for the processing,
          + the Personal Information has not been lawfully processed,
          + we are required to erase the Personal Information due to a
            legal obligation, or
          + you are a child and we have collected the personal data in
            relation to the offer of information society services.

   However, there might be requirements under applicable law, or other
   compelling reasons, that prevents us from immediately erasing your
   Personal Information. In such case, we will stop using your Personal
   Information for any other reasons than to comply with the applicable
   law, or the relevant compelling reason.
     * Right to restrict processing: This means that we temporarily
       restrict the processing of your Personal Information. You have the
       right to request restriction of the processing when:
          + you have requested rectification of your personal data in
            accordance with this Privacy Policy, during the period of time
            we are verifying the accuracy of the data,
          + the processing is unlawful and you do not want the Personal
            Information to be erased,
          + as data controller, we no longer need the Personal Information
            for the purposes for which it was collected, but you require
            us to retain the information for the establishment, exercise
            or defence of legal claims, or
          + you have objected to our legitimate interest for the
            processing in accordance with this Privacy Policy, during the
            period of time we determine whether the legitimate interest
            overrides your privacy rights.

   We will take all reasonable and possible actions to notify any
   recipients of your Personal Information regarding any rectification,
   erasure or restrictions carried out by us. At your request, we will
   also inform you with which third parties we have shared your Personal
   Information.
     * Right to object to processing. You have the right to object to the
       processing of your Personal Information based on our legitimate
       interest. If you object to such processing, we will only continue
       with the processing if we have a compelling legitimate reason for
       the processing that outweighs your interest, rights or freedoms, or
       if continued processing is necessary for the establishment,
       exercise or defence of a legal claim.
     * Right to portability. You have the right to receive certain of your
       Personal Information in a structured, commonly used and
       machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data
       to another controller. You only have this right when your personal
       data is processed by automated means and our legal basis for the
       processing is performance of a contract between you and us.
     * Right to lodge a complaint. You have the right to lodge any
       complaints regarding our processing of your personal data with the
       supervisory authority.

SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION

   We take reasonable technical, administrative and physical security
   measures to protect your information, including applying generally
   accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us
   during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of
   transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100%
   secure, so we unfortunately cannot guarantee absolute security. If you
   have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer
   secure (e.g., if you feel that the security of any account you might
   have with us has been compromised), please contact us immediately as
   detailed under the “Contact Us” heading below.

INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS

   Some of the parties with which we may share your information, as
   detailed in “How We Share Your Information”, may be located in
   countries that do not provide an equivalent level of protection as your
   home country. Where required, Nasdaq has implemented appropriate
   cross-border transfer solutions to provide adequate protection for
   transfers of certain personal information, including, but not limited
   to, the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (available
   at https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfe
   rs-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en
   ). To the extent permitted by applicable law, by using our Sites, and
   providing us information about you, you consent to the international
   transfer of information about you to the above parties.

RETENTION OF YOUR INFORMATION

   We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the
   purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and as otherwise needed to
   comply with applicable law and recordkeeping requirements or to address
   any complaints, challenges, legal or compliance matters related to the
   information.

COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES

   When you use our Sites, we along with our affiliates, subsidiaries and
   third party service providers may use “cookies” and similar
   technologies (e.g., log files, clear gifs, pixel tags and Flash LSOs)
   (collectively, “technology”). This technology may involve placing small
   files/code on your device or browser that serve a number of purposes,
   such as remembering your preferences (e.g., language) and generally
   improving your experience on our Sites. Specifically, we may use such
   technology for purposes such as to:
     * Provide us with general analytics about our Sites, including
       demographic information in a non-identifiable form, in order to
       improve our Sites’ performance and customize users’ experience;
     * Enable us to help you make better use of our services or Sites such
       as by suggesting how you can improve your use of different features
       or functionality or help address technical issues that you
       encounter in using our services or Sites;
     * Support security measures, such as requiring re-login into your
       account or additional authentication when using a new device to
       access our Sites;
     * Measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile
       statistics about the Site’s usage and email response rates;
     * Allow you to engage in our social media offerings on our Sites
       (e.g., Facebook “Like” button and LinkedIn integration); and
     * More effectively market our Sites and advertise other Sites that
       may be of interest to you.

   To learn more about the technology used on our Sites and how to disable
   some of the technology, visit our more comprehensive Cookie Statement.

REFERRALS

   If you choose to use our referral service to tell someone about our
   products or services or Sites, we will ask you for your friend’s name
   and email address. We will send your referral a one-time email to
   invite him/her to access the Site or with information about the product
   or service, and store his/her email address for the sole purpose of
   sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral
   program. Your referral may contact us as detailed under the “Contact
   Us” heading below to request we remove this information from our
   database.

LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES

   Our Sites may contain links to other websites or services that are not
   owned or controlled by Nasdaq, including links to websites of our
   advertisers, sponsors and partners. This Privacy Policy only applies to
   information collected by our Sites. We have no control over these third
   party websites, and your use of third party websites and features are
   subject to privacy policies posted on those websites. We are not
   responsible or liable for the privacy or business practices of any
   third party websites linked to our Sites. Your use of third parties’
   websites linked to our Sites is at your own risk, so we encourage you
   to read the privacy policies of any linked third party websites when
   you leave one of our Sites.

   We may use third party payment services to process purchases made
   through the Sites. If such service is made available and you wish to
   make a purchase through the Site, your Personal Information may be
   collected by the third party (and not by us). In that case, the
   information you provide to the third party will be subject to that
   third party’s privacy policy and not this Privacy Policy.

USE OF SITES BY CHILDREN

   None of our Sites are targeted for use by children under the age of
   sixteen. We do not target any of our products or services or Site
   content/features for use by children of such age.

CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

   Except to the extent limited by applicable law, we reserve the right to
   update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information
   practices by prominently posting notice of the update on our Sites.
   Unless otherwise noted, any updates will become effective 30 days after
   posting the updates to the Privacy Policy, and apply to all information
   collected about you. If we make any changes to this Privacy Policy that
   materially impact previously collected information about you, we will,
   to the extent that we have your email address, notify you by email.

       We transformed the financial markets with the introduction of the
       world’s first electronic stock market. Today, there are 4,000+
       company listings on our exchange.
     * Apple_Nasdaq Listed 1980 1980

       We empowered investors with the launch of the Nasdaq-100, an
       important growth index that includes 100 of the largest
       non-financial companies listed with us.
     * Steve Jobs_Bill Gates 1986
       With innovation in our DNA, we fueled the growth of the New
       Economy, attracting some of the biggest technology companies such
       as Microsoft, Amazon and Cisco.
     * MS Debut 2 2000
       Wall Street got a little brighter with the debut of MarketSite, our
       global headquarters and home to our daily opening and closing
       bells.
     * [yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7] 2001
       As part of our commitment to global expansion, we opened an office
       in Bangalore, India. Today, we have almost 40 offices around the
       world.
     * Google IPO 2004
       One of the most anticipated initial public offerings, Google — now
       part of Alphabet — rang the opening bell at MarketSite to kick off
       trading of its shares on our exchange.

       acquisition of OMX, a leading exchange operator in the Nordics.
