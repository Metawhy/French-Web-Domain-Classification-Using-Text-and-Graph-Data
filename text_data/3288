Monolithic Power Systems (MPS) MP2330x Synchronous Buck Converters

   Monolithic Power Systems (MPS) MP2330x Synchronous Buck Converters are
   fully integrated, high-frequency, step-down, and switch-mode converters
   with internal power MOSFETs. These converters use synchronous mode
   operation for higher efficiency over the output current load range. The
   MP2330x converters offer a compact solution that achieves 3A of
   continuous output current with excellent load and line regulation over
   a wide input range. These converters are available in a space-saving
   SOT583 package. The MP2330x converters operate at -40°C to 125°C
   temperature range and 4.2V to 24V supply voltage range.
