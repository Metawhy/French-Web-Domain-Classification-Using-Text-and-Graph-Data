Premier Gallery for Contemporary Western Art

   For more than 20 years, the Ann Korologos Gallery has specialized in
   Western art and artists influenced by the West.  We understand that the
   West is as varied as its breathtaking landscapes, and so is its
   art. That’s why we seek out artists working in all media and from all
   parts of the US.
