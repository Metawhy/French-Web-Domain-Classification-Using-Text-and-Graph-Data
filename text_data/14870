   If opal and galaxy hair weren't bold enough for you, here is the
   perfect fix for those boring ol' dye trends. The Internet is erupting
   with people experimenting with the latest and greatest in hair trends,
   glitter roots. The self-explanatory trend involves adding glitter —
   whether that be an explosion of sparkles or just a light dusting — to
   the roots for an unmissable look.

   Shockingly, there's actually a practical component to glitter roots.
   Women with dyed hair are using the glitter to put off going to the
   salon as their natural roots grow in. The glitter is a useful way to
   hide the roots while adding a twinkle to your hairdo.

   "The glitter hair roots trend is something I've seen emerging for a
   couple years now and I think it's super cute and edgy when done right,"
   New Jersey-based hairstylist Karen Wiggins tells Today. To get the
   trend right, Wiggins advises using a concoction of glitter and clear
   styling gel then spreading the mixture, at most, one inch from the part
   using your fingers or, if you're fancy, a foundation brush you don't
   mind ruining.

   Most importantly, the trend is described as "a fun and fresh way to hit
   the town or upgrade your selfie" by Fox & Jane salons co-founder Lorean
   Cairns.

   You can take a look at some of these upgraded selfies below.
