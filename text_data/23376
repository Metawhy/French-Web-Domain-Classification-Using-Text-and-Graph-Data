     Abstract: We report on the neutrino mass measurement result from the
     first four-week science run of the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino
     experiment KATRIN in spring 2019. Beta-decay electrons from a
     high-purity gaseous molecular tritium source are energy analyzed by
     a high-resolution MAC-E filter. A fit of the integrated electron
     spectrum over a narrow interval around the kinematic endpoint at
     18.57 keV gives an effective neutrino mass square value of
     $(-1.0^{+0.9}_{-1.1})$ eV$^2$. From this we derive an upper limit of
     1.1 eV (90$\%$ confidence level) on the absolute mass scale of
     neutrinos. This value coincides with the KATRIN sensitivity. It
     improves upon previous mass limits from kinematic measurements by
     almost a factor of two and provides model-independent input to
     cosmological studies of structure formation.

Title:Upper Bound of Neutrino Masses from Combined Cosmological Observations
and Particle Physics Experiments

   Authors:Arthur Loureiro, Andrei Cuceu, Filipe B. Abdalla, Bruno Moraes,
   Lorne Whiteway, Michael McLeod, Sreekumar T. Balan, Ofer Lahav,
   Aurélien Benoit-Lévy, Marc Manera, Richard P. Rollins, Henrique S.
   Xavier
   (Submitted on 6 Nov 2018 (v1), last revised 27 Aug 2019 (this version,
   v2))

     Abstract: We investigate the impact of prior models on the upper
     bound of the sum of neutrino masses, $\sum m_{\nu}$. We use data
     from Large Scale Structure of galaxies, Cosmic Microwave Background,
     Type Ia SuperNovae, and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We probe
     physically motivated neutrino mass models (respecting oscillation
     experiment constraints) and compare them to constraints using
     standard cosmological approximations. The former give a consistent
     upper bound of $\sum m_{\nu} \lesssim 0.26$ eV ($95\%$ CI) and
     yields a strong competitive upper bound for the lightest neutrino
     mass species, $m_0^{\nu} < 0.086$ eV ($95\%$ CI). By contrast one of
     the approximations, which is somewhat inconsistent with oscillation
     experiments, yields an upper bound of $\sum m_{\nu} \lesssim 0.15$
     eV ($95\%$ CI), which differs substantially from the former upper
     bound. We, therefore, argue that cosmological neutrino mass and
     hierarchy determination should be pursued using physically motivated
     models since approximations might lead to incorrect and nonphysical
     upper bounds.

Title:On the Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture

   Authors:Dimitris Koukoulopoulos, James Maynard
   (Submitted on 10 Jul 2019)

     Abstract: Let $\psi:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{R}_{\ge0}$ be an arbitrary
     function from the positive integers to the non-negative reals.
     Consider the set $\mathcal{A}$ of real numbers $\alpha$ for which
     there are infinitely many reduced fractions $a/q$ such that
     $|\alpha-a/q|\le \psi(q)/q$. If $\sum_{q=1}^\infty
     \psi(q)\phi(q)/q=\infty$, we show that $\mathcal{A}$ has full
     Lebesgue measure. This answers a question of Duffin and Schaeffer.
     As a corollary, we also establish a conjecture due to Catlin
     regarding non-reduced solutions to the inequality $|\alpha - a/q|\le
     \psi(q)/q$, giving a refinement of Khinchin's Theorem.

General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology

Title:Quantum Transfiguration of Kruskal Black Holes

   Authors:Abhay Ashtekar, Javier Olmedo, Parampreet Singh
   (Submitted on 2 Jun 2018 (v1), last revised 9 Nov 2018 (this version,
   v2))

     Abstract: We present a new effective description of macroscopic
     Kruskal black holes that incorporates corrections due to quantum
     geometry effects of loop quantum gravity. It encompasses both the
     `interior' region that contains classical singularities and the
     `exterior' asymptotic region. Singularities are naturally resolved
     by the quantum geometry effects of loop quantum gravity, and the
     resulting quantum extension of the full Kruskal space-time is free
     of all the known limitations of previous investigations [1-11] of
     the Schwarzschild interior. We compare and contrast our results with
     these investigations and also with the expectations based on the
     AdS/CFT duality [12].

General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology

Title:Small black/white hole stability and dark matter

   Authors:Carlo Rovelli, Francesca Vidotto
   (Submitted on 10 May 2018 (v1), last revised 9 Nov 2018 (this version,
   v2))

     Abstract: We show that the expected lifetime of white holes formed
     as remnants of evaporated black holes is consistent with their
     production at reheating. We give a simple quantum description of
     these objects and argue that a quantum superposition of black and
     white holes with large interiors is stable, because it is protected
     by the existence of a minimal eigenvalue of the area, predicted by
     Loop Quantum Gravity. These two results support the hypothesis that
     a component of dark matter could be formed by small black hole
     remnants.

     Abstract: We report on the neutrino mass measurement result from the
     first four-week science run of the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino
     experiment KATRIN in spring 2019. Beta-decay electrons from a
     high-purity gaseous molecular tritium source are energy analyzed by
     a high-resolution MAC-E filter. A fit of the integrated electron
     spectrum over a narrow interval around the kinematic endpoint at
     18.57 keV gives an effective neutrino mass square value of
     $(-1.0^{+0.9}_{-1.1})$ eV$^2$. From this we derive an upper limit of
     1.1 eV (90$\%$ confidence level) on the absolute mass scale of
     neutrinos. This value coincides with the KATRIN sensitivity. It
     improves upon previous mass limits from kinematic measurements by
     almost a factor of two and provides model-independent input to
     cosmological studies of structure formation.

Title:Upper Bound of Neutrino Masses from Combined Cosmological Observations
and Particle Physics Experiments

   (Submitted on 6 Nov 2018 (v1), last revised 27 Aug 2019 (this version,
   v2))

     Abstract: We investigate the impact of prior models on the upper
     bound of the sum of neutrino masses, $\sum m_{\nu}$. We use data
     from Large Scale Structure of galaxies, Cosmic Microwave Background,
     Type Ia SuperNovae, and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We probe
     physically motivated neutrino mass models (respecting oscillation
     experiment constraints) and compare them to constraints using
     standard cosmological approximations. The former give a consistent
     upper bound of $\sum m_{\nu} \lesssim 0.26$ eV ($95\%$ CI) and
     yields a strong competitive upper bound for the lightest neutrino
     mass species, $m_0^{\nu} < 0.086$ eV ($95\%$ CI). By contrast one of
     the approximations, which is somewhat inconsistent with oscillation
     experiments, yields an upper bound of $\sum m_{\nu} \lesssim 0.15$
     eV ($95\%$ CI), which differs substantially from the former upper
     bound. We, therefore, argue that cosmological neutrino mass and
     hierarchy determination should be pursued using physically motivated
     models since approximations might lead to incorrect and nonphysical
     upper bounds.

Title:On the Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture

   Authors:Dimitris Koukoulopoulos, James Maynard
   (Submitted on 10 Jul 2019)

     Abstract: Let $\psi:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{R}_{\ge0}$ be an arbitrary
     function from the positive integers to the non-negative reals.
     Consider the set $\mathcal{A}$ of real numbers $\alpha$ for which
     there are infinitely many reduced fractions $a/q$ such that
     $|\alpha-a/q|\le \psi(q)/q$. If $\sum_{q=1}^\infty
     \psi(q)\phi(q)/q=\infty$, we show that $\mathcal{A}$ has full
     Lebesgue measure. This answers a question of Duffin and Schaeffer.
     As a corollary, we also establish a conjecture due to Catlin
     regarding non-reduced solutions to the inequality $|\alpha - a/q|\le
     \psi(q)/q$, giving a refinement of Khinchin's Theorem.

General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology

Title:Quantum Transfiguration of Kruskal Black Holes

   Authors:Abhay Ashtekar, Javier Olmedo, Parampreet Singh
   (Submitted on 2 Jun 2018 (v1), last revised 9 Nov 2018 (this version,
   v2))

     Abstract: We present a new effective description of macroscopic
     Kruskal black holes that incorporates corrections due to quantum
     geometry effects of loop quantum gravity. It encompasses both the
     `interior' region that contains classical singularities and the
     `exterior' asymptotic region. Singularities are naturally resolved
     by the quantum geometry effects of loop quantum gravity, and the
     resulting quantum extension of the full Kruskal space-time is free
     of all the known limitations of previous investigations [1-11] of
     the Schwarzschild interior. We compare and contrast our results with
     these investigations and also with the expectations based on the
     AdS/CFT duality [12].

General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology

Title:Small black/white hole stability and dark matter

   Authors:Carlo Rovelli, Francesca Vidotto
   (Submitted on 10 May 2018 (v1), last revised 9 Nov 2018 (this version,
   v2))

     Abstract: We show that the expected lifetime of white holes formed
     as remnants of evaporated black holes is consistent with their
     production at reheating. We give a simple quantum description of
     these objects and argue that a quantum superposition of black and
     white holes with large interiors is stable, because it is protected
     by the existence of a minimal eigenvalue of the area, predicted by
     Loop Quantum Gravity. These two results support the hypothesis that
     a component of dark matter could be formed by small black hole
     remnants.

General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology

Title:Planck stars

   Authors:Carlo Rovelli, Francesca Vidotto
   (Submitted on 25 Jan 2014 (v1), last revised 8 Feb 2014 (this version,
   v4))

     Abstract: A star that collapses gravitationally can reach a further
     stage of its life, where quantum-gravitational pressure counteracts
     weight. The duration of this stage is very short in the star proper
     time, yielding a bounce, but extremely long seen from the outside,
     because of the huge gravitational time dilation. Since the onset of
     quantum-gravitational effects is governed by energy density ---not
     by size--- the star can be much larger than planckian in this phase.
     The object emerging at the end of the Hawking evaporation of a black
     hole can then be larger than planckian by a factor
     $(m/m_{\scriptscriptstyle P})^n$, where $m$ is the mass fallen into
     the hole, $m_{\scriptscriptstyle P}$ is the Planck mass, and $n$ is
     positive. We consider arguments for $n=1/3$ and for $n=1$. There is
     no causality violation or faster-than-light propagation. The
     existence of these objects alleviates the black-hole information
     paradox. More interestingly, these objects could have astrophysical
     and cosmological interest: they produce a detectable signal, of
     quantum gravitational origin, around the $10^{-14} cm$ wavelength.

Title:Nontrivial Turmites are Turing-universal

   Authors:Diego Maldonado, Anahí Gajardo, Benjamin Hellouin de Menibus,
   Andrés Moreira
   (Submitted on 18 Feb 2017)

     Abstract: A Turmit is a Turing machine that works over a
     two-dimensional grid, that is, an agent that moves, reads and writes
     symbols over the cells of the grid. Its state is an arrow and,
     depending on the symbol that it reads, it turns to the left or to
     the right, switching the symbol at the same time. Several symbols
     are admitted, and the rule is specified by the turning sense that
     the machine has over each symbol. Turmites are a generalization of
     Langtons ant, and they present very complex and diverse behaviors.
     We prove that any Turmite, except for those whose rule does not
     depend on the symbol, can simulate any Turing Machine. We also prove
     the P-completeness of prediction their future behavior by explicitly
     giving a log-space reduction from the Topological Circuit Value
     Problem. A similar result was already established for Langtons ant;
     here we use a similar technique but prove a stronger notion of
     simulation, and for a more general family.

Title:Further travels with my ant

   Authors:David Gale, James Propp, Scott Sutherland, Serge Troubetzkoy
   (Submitted on 19 Jan 1995)

     Abstract: We discuss some properties of a class of cellular automata
     sometimes called a "generalized ant". This system is perhaps most
     easily understood by thinking of an ant which moves about a lattice
     in the plane. At each vertex (or "cell"), the ant turns right or
     left, depending on the the state of the cell, and then changes the
     state of the cell according to certain prescribed rule strings.
     (This system has been the subject of several Mathematical
     Entertainments columns in the Mathematical Intelligencer; this
     article will be a future such column). At various times, the
     distributions of the states of the cells for certain ants is
     bilaterally symmetric; we categorize a class of ants for which this
     is the case and give a proof using Truchet tiles.

Title:Two-Dimensional Kolmogorov Complexity and Validation of the Coding
Theorem Method by Compressibility

   Authors:Hector Zenil, Fernando Soler-Toscano, Jean-Paul Delahaye,
   Nicolas Gauvrit
   (Submitted on 30 Dec 2012 (v1), last revised 26 Aug 2015 (this version,
   v4))

     Abstract: We propose a measure based upon the fundamental
     theoretical concept in algorithmic information theory that provides
     a natural approach to the problem of evaluating $n$-dimensional
     complexity by using an $n$-dimensional deterministic Turing machine.
     The technique is interesting because it provides a natural
     algorithmic process for symmetry breaking generating complex
     $n$-dimensional structures from perfectly symmetric and fully
     deterministic computational rules producing a distribution of
     patterns as described by algorithmic probability. Algorithmic
     probability also elegantly connects the frequency of occurrence of a
     pattern with its algorithmic complexity, hence effectively providing
     estimations to the complexity of the generated patterns. Experiments
     to validate estimations of algorithmic complexity based on these
     concepts are presented, showing that the measure is stable in the
     face of some changes in computational formalism and that results are
     in agreement with the results obtained using lossless compression
     algorithms when both methods overlap in their range of
     applicability. We then use the output frequency of the set of
     2-dimensional Turing machines to classify the algorithmic complexity
     of the space-time evolutions of Elementary Cellular Automata.

Title:Algorithmic Complexity for Short Binary Strings Applied to Psychology:
A Primer

   Authors:Nicolas Gauvrit, Hector Zenil, Jean-Paul Delahaye, Fernando
   Soler-Toscano
   (Submitted on 15 Jun 2011 (v1), last revised 9 Dec 2013 (this version,
   v3))

     Abstract: Since human randomness production has been studied and
     widely used to assess executive functions (especially inhibition),
     many measures have been suggested to assess the degree to which a
     sequence is random-like. However, each of them focuses on one
     feature of randomness, leading authors to have to use multiple
     measures. Here we describe and advocate for the use of the accepted
     universal measure for randomness based on algorithmic complexity, by
     means of a novel previously presented technique using the the
     definition of algorithmic probability. A re-analysis of the
     classical Radio Zenith data in the light of the proposed measure and
     methodology is provided as a study case of an application.
