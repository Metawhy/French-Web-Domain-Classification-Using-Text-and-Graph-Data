   I wanted to do something that would focus on the hyper-sexualization of
   women in video games. I proposed my idea to Sophie and she wanted to do
   something with me to address social justice. She made a joke saying,
   ‘Why not have a game where you throw tampons at people?’ At first, we
   laughed, but after talking about menstruation and how embarrassed we
   were about it, we realized that it could be worth exploring. Read More

   I’m not a shy person, but I’ve always been a bit doubtful in my
   abilities. During the Summer Immersion Program, we had to code an mp3
   player. When I realized that I could use code to make something I use
   every day, it made me braver. Read More

   Before Girls Who Code, I never saw myself as a coder or an engineer.
   Girls Who Code gave me not just valuable coding skills but a valuable
   opportunity: to see myself in a whole new way. Now, I see myself as
   someone who can take on a big industry regardless of the gender gap. I
   am a more able, confident, and ambitious girl with big dreams and I
   want to share that with everyone around the world. Read More

   Girls Who Code gave me the kind of education you can’t find in a
   classroom. Not only was I taught how to program using multiple
   languages, but I was given the opportunity to talk to women who have
   successful careers in the field. Girls Who Code made me understand that
   computer science isn’t just about 1’s and 0’s, it’s about combining
   your interests with technology to better the future. Read More

   Lots of people assume that I’m one-dimensional and don’t have many
   other interests aside from coding. Or they think I’m “not as girly” as
   other girls my age. Excuse you, but I am perfectly capable of typing an
   HTML tag while my brows are on point. Read More

   I am a member of my school’s business club – in fact, i’m the only girl
   – and we had an assignment to pitch different ideas for business. I
   thought of an anonymous communications app where people can talk about
   similar interests with no locations, names, likes, etc. My business
   club couldn’t make it so I decided to make it myself. I worked with a
   developer and also joined a Girls Who Code club because I want to be
   able to make something like this by myself. I also believe coding is
   the language of the future. Read More

Become a Corporate Partner

   With the support of our sponsors, Girls Who Code is building the
   largest pipeline of future female engineers.

Let's Work Together

   Our organization relies on support from partners to drive our work.
   Based on thoughtful conversation with your organization, we’ll develop
   a customized partnership to direct your donation to initiatives and
   programs within Girls Who Code. If you make a commitment to generally
   support Girls Who Code, your funding will go toward our overall
   operation and management of our programs across the country, reaching
   thousands of girls each year.

   As a company committed to building a diverse workforce and as an early
   supporter of Girls Who Code, AT&T has seen first-hand the power of
   nurturing young women’s careers in high tech fields. By supporting the
   Girls Who Code Alumnae Network, we are giving these girls – the first
   of whom are just beginning their collegiate journey – a way to stay
   connected to the program and to each other.

   Silicon Valley companies are clamoring for technical women. But not
   enough women are pursuing these careers. Girls Who Code has found the
   magic in building 1:1 relationships for girls with strong mentors, and
   their results have been impressive. We’re excited to invest in
   mentoring and eventually hiring Girls Who Code graduates as part of our
   workforce.

   The Prudential Foundation’s support for Girls Who Code is aimed at not
   only helping solve the gender and skills gaps in STEM, but also solving
   a real business challenge for our industry. Most people don’t think of
   a company like Prudential when they consider the impact of the tech
   skills shortage on the private sector, but the financial services
   industry is increasingly reliant on technology to deliver the
   convenient and customized services our customers demand.

   START A CLUB

Why start a Club?

   Tech jobs are among the fastest growing in the country, yet girls are
   being left behind. While girls’ interest in computer science ebbs over
   time, the biggest drop off happens between the ages of 13-17. Enter
   Girls Who Code Clubs: a FREE after-school program for girls in 3rd-5th
   and 6th-12th grade. Our Clubs are fun, accessible — and they work! Our
   Clubs alumni go on to major in Computer Science at 15 times the
   national average rate.

Who can start a Club?

   Short answer: an adult associated with a non-profit organization, such
   as:

Educator

   at a school or library

Administrator

   or staff at a non-profit

College Student

   18+, who can pair with a faculty member

   LEARN MORE

What you'll need to start a Club

   Classroom- Space to host the Club, such as a classroom, library, or
   computer lab
   Technology- Computers & Internet connection for each Club member

What you'll get from Girls Who Code

     * Curriculum: Our curriculum includes Women in Tech Spotlights,
       self-guided tutorials, and interactive activities to create a Girls
       Who Code Project. We also provide sample agendas and Facilitator
       Training materials to guide you through the Club.

     * HQ, our Custom Learning Platform: A beautiful and intuitive website
       with all our curricular and Facilitator resources

     * Training & Support: Most Facilitators don’t have a Computer Science
       degree; instead, they learn alongside their Club members. We
       provide virtual training and support, including webinars, coding
       tutorials, and a community of thousands of other volunteers.

     * Recruitment & Media Resources: Posters, info session toolkits,
       suggested emails and social media copy, and much more to help you
       promote your Club and recruit girls!

Leading a Club

   Girls Who Code Clubs are led by Facilitators, who are 18+ and can be
   teachers, computer scientists, librarians, parents, college students or
   volunteers from any background or field. Many Facilitators have NO
   technical experience and learn to code alongside their Club members.
   That’s why we use the term “Facilitator” instead of “teacher.” Our Club
   Facilitators guide Club girls through the curriculum, helping them to
   build sisterhood within the Club and learn to use computer science to
   impact their community.

   multiple Clubs across your network.
