   Improved greenhouse gas (GHG) emission efficiency of production has
   been proposed as one of the biggest potential advantages of cultured
   meat over conventional livestock production systems. Comparisons with
   beef are typically highlighted, as it is a highly emissions intensive
   food product. In this study, we present a more rigorous comparison of
   the potential climate impacts of cultured meat and cattle production
   than has previously been made. Warming impacts are evaluated using a
   simple climate model that simulates the different behaviors of carbon
   dioxide (CO[2]), methane (CH[4]), and nitrous oxide (N[2]O), rather
   than relying on carbon dioxide equivalent (CO[2]e) metrics. We compare
   the temperature impact of beef cattle and cultured meat production at
   all times to 1,000 years in the future, using four synthetic meat GHG
   footprints currently available in the literature and three different
   beef production systems studied in an earlier climate modeling paper.
   Cattle systems are associated with the production of all three GHGs
   above, including significant emissions of CH[4], while cultured meat
   emissions are almost entirely CO[2] from energy generation. Under
   continuous high global consumption, cultured meat results in less
   warming than cattle initially, but this gap narrows in the long term
   and in some cases cattle production causes far less warming, as CH[4]
   emissions do not accumulate, unlike CO[2]. We then model a decline in
   meat consumption to more sustainable levels following high consumption,
   and show that although cattle systems generally result in greater peak
   warming than cultured meat, the warming effect declines and stabilizes
   under the new emission rates of cattle systems, while the CO[2] based
   warming from cultured meat persists and accumulates even under reduced
   consumption, again overtaking cattle production in some scenarios. We
   conclude that cultured meat is not prima facie climatically superior to
   cattle; its relative impact instead depends on the availability of
   decarbonized energy generation and the specific production systems that
   are realized.

Introduction

   Cultured meat is an emerging technology in which animal muscle cells
   are produced through tissue culture in a controlled factory or
   laboratory environment, in contrast to traditional whole-animal
   livestock systems (Stephens et al., 2018). Other commonly used terms
   include clean, in vitro, lab-grown, or synthetic meat. Reducing the
   environmental impacts of meat production, and particularly greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions, is generally highlighted as a significant
   potential advantage of cultured meat (Tuomisto and Teixeira de Mattos,
   2011; Post, 2012). Despite recent research and popular interest in
   cultured meat, and the frequency with which its supposed climate
   benefits are reported, the potential temperature impacts of cultured
   meat production have not yet been investigated.

   Livestock production systems are associated with a number of GHG
   emissions, and have made a significant contribution to anthropogenic
   climate change (Reisinger and Clark, 2018). Broadly, the livestock
   themselves result in emissions of methane (CH[4]) and nitrous oxide
   (N[2]O) from their manures, and further methane from enteric
   fermentation in ruminants. Further GHGs associated with, but not
   directly emitted by, animal production include the loss of nitrous
   oxide from fertilizer application to grow their feed, carbon dioxide
   (CO[2]) emissions from the conversion of land for pasture or feed
   production, and CO[2] emissions resulting from fossil fuel based energy
   generation, for example in tractor fuels or the manufacture of
   fertilizers (in addition to by-product CO[2] also formed in fertilizer
   production, Dawson and Hilton, 2011). While there is a very large range
   in emissions associated with different animal production systems, they
   are generally shown to emit significantly more per unit of food output
   (for example emissions per kg final product or per kg protein) than
   plant-based systems, and beef is typically highlighted as among the
   most emission intensive food products (Clune et al., 2017; Poore and
   Nemecek, 2018).

   Proponents of cultured meat have suggested that bypassing the wider
   biological processes of the whole animal can result in lower emissions
   per unit of meat produced, as the direct animal emissions are avoided,
   and cultured systems could be designed to more efficiently convert
   inputs into the desired output (meat), thus minimizing the emissions
   associated with the production of these inputs. A trade-off may exist
   in significant energy demand to maintain the controlled manufacturing
   environment that essentially replaces some of the animal's biological
   functions (Mattick et al., 2015b); and large uncertainties remain in
   what viable, animal-free, growth media may look like (Stephens et al.,
   2018) and hence their potential resource demand.

   Despite the remaining unknowns in large-scale cultured meat production,
   a small number of studies have undertaken speculative life cycle
   assessments (LCA) to predict the environmental footprint of cultured
   meat (Tuomisto and Teixeira de Mattos, 2011; Tuomisto et al., 2014;
   Mattick et al., 2015b; Smetana et al., 2015). The suggested GHG
   emissions per unit of cultured meat produced (“carbon footprints”) vary
   significantly, as they are based on different production systems and
   assumed inputs, and take alternative approaches in anticipating future
   developments. Nonetheless, the GHG emissions per unit of cultured meat
   are uniformly shown as superior to that of beef where this comparison
   is made (trends are less clear for other animal products).

   To date, these comparisons (and most others evaluating the relative
   emissions intensity of different products or activities) are based on
   carbon dioxide equivalent (CO[2]e) metrics that relate the emissions of
   different GHGs to carbon dioxide. However, such metrics may be
   misleading, and provide a poor indication of actual temperature
   response (Pierrehumbert, 2014). Individual gases differ both in the
   amount they change the atmospheric energy balance (radiative forcing),
   and hence lead to warming, and how long they persist in the atmosphere.
   Per molecule, methane results in significantly greater radiative
   forcing than carbon dioxide, but has an atmospheric lifespan of only
   around 12 years (Myhre et al., 2013) in contrast to the millennial
   persistence of carbon dioxide (Archer and Brovkin, 2008). Nitrous oxide
   has a much greater radiative forcing per molecule than both methane and
   carbon dioxide, and an atmospheric lifetime of just over 100 years
   (Myhre et al., 2013). The most commonly used carbon dioxide equivalence
   metric, the 100-years Global Warming Potential (GWP[100]), equates each
   gas by integrating the amount of radiative forcing that a one-off
   emissions pulse would exert over a 100-years period (Myhre et al.,
   2013). If we are to consider the climate effects of ongoing production,
   however, we need to consider the impact of continued emissions rates of
   each gas. GWP[100] based comparisons, among other limitations, do not
   sufficiently capture the temporal behavior of different gases, and in
   particular fail to express the cumulative nature of continued carbon
   dioxide emissions, and hence can relatively overstate the warming
   impact of methane (Pierrehumbert, 2014). Additionally, due to the short
   lifetime of methane, any warming it causes is largely undone shortly
   after emissions are removed, in contrast to carbon dioxide. Inferring
   relative temperature impacts from GWP[100] footprints can therefore be
   especially problematic where short-lived gases such as methane
   constitute a significant proportion of emissions, as is the case for
   beef production.

   This paper presents the first attempt to compare the potential climate
   impacts of cultured meat and beef cattle production using an
   atmospheric modeling approach, rather than relying on carbon dioxide
   equivalent comparisons. We test a number of cultured meat and beef
   system emissions footprints under three alternative consumption
   pathways, comparing the temperature impacts under different production
   and consumption scenarios at all timescales to 1,000 years.

Methods

   In order to ensure standardization, the atmospheric models, consumption
   pathways, and representative cattle production emissions all follow
   Pierrehumbert and Eshel (2015).

   A literature review was undertaken in April 2018 to screen for cultured
   meat emissions footprints. As considerable uncertainty remains over
   what real, large-scale cultured meat production may look like, four
   different footprints found in this literature review were used to
   illustrate some of the possibilities.

   The first cultured meat LCA study, presented in Tuomisto and Teixeira
   de Mattos (2011), hypothesized a system in which animal embryonic stem
   cells are grown in a cylindrical stirred tank bioreactor in a medium of
   cyanobacteria hydrolysate (as the main “feed” input), vitamins and
   animal growth factors. Animal growth factors are produced from
   genetically engineered Escherichia coli, and both growth factors and
   vitamins are considered to be required in negligible volumes, and hence
   incur negligible environmental impacts (including GHG emissions). The
   cyanobacteria production is assumed to take place in an open pond, with
   some synthetic nitrogen use considered in the default case, but either
   nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria or “nutrient-rich wastewater” used to
   eliminate the need for fertilizer inputs in the most optimistic
   scenarios. Greenhouse gas emissions result primarily from energy use
   and transport in growing and moving the cyanobacteria to the site of
   cultured meat production, followed by energy use in cyanobacteria
   processing and stirring the cell culture tank for 60 days. Residual
   heat following cyanobacteria hydrolysate sterilization initially warms
   the culture medium, and following this it is assumed heat generated by
   the metabolism of cells growing in the culture negates the need for
   external heating. Greenhouse gas footprints were then estimated based
   on the conditions and emissions per unit of energy use for three
   representative regions (Thailand, California, and Spain), with
   emissions from electricity generation lowest in Thailand and highest in
   California. The cultured meat output assumed as the functional unit was
   a “minced-beef type” product with equivalent protein content to low fat
   meat. For further details see Tuomisto and Teixeira de Mattos (2011).
   Following through the assumed yields and allocation conventions used in
   this study (see discussion below), the average emissions footprint was
   approximately 2.01 kg CO[2]e per kg cultured meat. As this study
   represents the most optimistic scenario, we use the lowest value
   presented in the sensitivity analysis of 1.69 kg CO[2]e per kg cultured
   meat, assuming no fertilizer use was necessary for cyanobacteria
   production and electricity generation uses the lowest Thai emissions
   footprint. It was not possible to separate out individual greenhouse
   gases, and so it is assumed that the entire footprint is carbon dioxide
   emissions. As there was no fertilizer use in the footprint used, and in
   alternative footprints below other emissions represent relatively small
   proportions of the total footprint, this assumption is unlikely to
   significantly affect the results.

   The second cultured meat footprint used in this study was obtained from
   Tuomisto et al. (2014). The hypothesized systems are largely as
   described above from Tuomisto and Teixeira de Mattos (2011), but with
   some refinements made to the assumed operation of the bioreactor, and a
   number of plant-based alternative feedstocks considered in addition to
   cyanobacteria. Wheat or maize feedstocks were assumed to have been
   grown with the GHG footprints of typical UK production from Williams et
   al. (2006) and sterilized and hydrolyzed as described above for
   cyanobacteria. A hollow capillary bioreactor was selected to represent
   a superior option to the stirred cylinder design above, but in this
   case also included an energy input in maintaining growth temperature
   (37°C) for cultured cells. As this study still represents an optimistic
   but potentially more realistic footprint than suggested by Tuomisto and
   Teixeira de Mattos (2011), an intermediate value of 3.67 kg CO[2]e per
   kg cultured meat was selected from the range of results presented,
   assuming maize feedstock (with a greater production footprint than
   cyanobacteria but less than wheat), and an average of the best- and
   worst-case bioreactor yield scenarios. This footprint is also assumed
   to be composed entirely of carbon dioxide emissions. In practice,
   nitrous oxide emissions would also be expected from a proportion of the
   nitrogen inputs in growing maize, but it was not possible to separate
   out this component of emissions. The omission is again considered
   unlikely to significantly influence conclusions, as discussed below in
   the context of results for other cultured meat systems.

   The remaining two cultured meat footprints were both taken from Mattick
   et al. (2015b). In this study, a two-step culturing process is assumed:
   after 5 days of proliferation of muscle stem cells, the bioreactor is
   drained and filled with a different medium for 72 h of cell
   differentiation and mass gain. It is assumed that the main constituents
   of the culture media are peptides and amino acids from soy hydrolysis,
   glucose from corn starch, and again a negligible volume of growth
   factors. In contrast to the more speculative approach of the two papers
   above, this study bases its assumptions on the metabolic requirements
   and yields of cultured meat on data from Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO)
   cell proliferation (Sung et al., 2004), as a previously tested analog
   for cell culture conditions. Corn starch microcarrier beads provide a
   scaffold around which cells proliferate, and the process is assumed to
   take place within stirred-tank bioreactors. Energy is required for
   aeration, mixing and temperature regulation during the culture phase.
   Finally, the bioreactors are cleaned between each culture batch by
   rinsing with sodium hydroxide and heating to 77.5°C. See Mattick et al.
   (2015b) for further details. As more optimistic estimates were already
   demonstrated in the two papers above, the average cultured meat
   footprint was used rather than the low end of the sensitivity analysis.
   This GHG footprint was 6.64 kg CO[2], 0.019 CH[4], and 0.0013 kg N[2]O,
   giving a total GWP[100] footprint of 7.5 kg CO[2]e per kg cultured meat
   (disaggregated emissions from Carolyn Mattick, pers. comm.).

   To represent the upper end of proposed emissions footprints for
   cultured meat production, the result from the high end of the
   sensitivity analysis in Mattick et al. (2015b) was also used. Here,
   lower cell densities are achieved at the end of the proliferation
   phase, no further biomass growth is achieved in the differentiation
   phase, and the biomanufacturing facility building size and energy
   footprint are treated as comparable to a pharmaceutical plant, rather
   than a brewery as in the default scenario. This resulted in a footprint
   of 25 kg CO[2]e per kg cultured meat. It was not possible to extract
   the individual gas composition from the sensitivity analysis, but for
   this study we assume that the gases constitute the same proportions as
   in the baseline case, resulting in 22.1 kg CO[2], 0.062 CH[4], and
   0.0043 kg N[2]O per kg cultured meat.

   A further emissions footprint for cultured meat is also provided by
   Smetana et al. (2015), but as some details regarding the functional
   unit, system boundaries and production methods assumed in this study
   were unclear, and the carbon dioxide equivalent footprint presented was
   similar to the result at the high end of the sensitivity analysis in
   Mattick et al. (2015b), it was not used in this study.

   Three representative beef footprints were used following Pierrehumbert
   and Eshel (2015) to illustrate some of the variation in quantity and
   composition of emissions associated with contemporary beef production
   systems (Table 1). The lowest footprint for all gases is demonstrated
   by production at an organic Swedish ranch from Cederberg and Nillson
   (2004). This is an extensive, low-input (no pesticides or synthetic
   fertilizers, but organic pig manure imported) system that achieves
   birth rates of approximately one animal a year and fast weight gain,
   hence low methane emissions per output. An alternative footprint
   composition is shown in the Brazilian pasture system from Cederberg et
   al. (2009), which is also an extensive, low-input system, but methane
   emissions per unit beef produced are significantly greater due to
   slower animal weight gain. CO[2] emissions from production are likely
   actually lower than in the Swedish case (rather than equal, as shown in
   the table) as this footprint includes emissions resulting transport
   from Brazil to Europe; however, these are more than offset by likely
   emissions resulting from deforestation, which are not included here but
   returned to in the discussion. Finally, the highest beef footprint
   included is a pasture system in the Midwestern USA from Pelletier et
   al. (2010). This system also achieves relatively fast animal weight
   gain, and so methane emissions are equivalent to the Swedish system,
   but this is achieved through an energy and input intensive management
   that results in high carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions. For
   further details see Pierrehumbert and Eshel (2015) and the original
   studies referenced. Two further footprints demonstrating emissions from
   a Midwestern USA feedlot and the average for Swedish beef production
   included in Pierrehumbert and Eshel (2015) were omitted from this study
   for clarity, as they provided intermediate emission profiles that were
   similar to those described above.
   TABLE 1
   www.frontiersin.org

   Table 1. Emissions profiles of cultured meat and beef cattle
   production, expressed as individual gases and total IPCC 5th Assessment
   Report 100-Years Global Warming Potential carbon dioxide equivalent
   (GWP[100] CO[2]e) per kg of meat output (either cultured meat or bone
   free beef).

   As these beef footprints are not completely harmonized (e.g., the
   emissions incurred in the transport of Brazilian beef to Europe noted
   above), the emissions described for each system may represent
   methodological differences between studies, such as different system
   boundaries, co-product allocations and LCA databases, rather than
   differences between the beef production systems themselves. Comparing
   individual LCA studies can be problematic, even for the same product
   (de Vries et al., 2015), and there are significant challenges in
   standardizing agricultural LCAs (Adewale et al., 2018). For the
   purposes of this study, these footprints provide contrasting
   case-studies with a different balance of GHG emissions to illustrate
   the distinct climate impacts of each gas, but should not necessarily be
   taken as globally representative or definitive, standardized beef LCAs.

   Emissions footprints for every system are shown in Table 1. It should
   be noted that all cultured meat carbon dioxide equivalent footprint
   estimates, including the high end of the sensitivity analysis, are
   lower than those of every cattle system in this study.

Consumption Pathways

   Three alternative consumption pathways were used to illustrate the
   dynamics resulting from the alternative GHG footprints, with impacts
   from all systems shown for 1,000 years.

   The first scenario is based on constant, very high levels of meat
   consumption: 25 kg per capita per annum (roughly the contemporary beef
   consumption rate in the USA) for a population of 10 billion. This
   pathway is intended to explore the temperature impacts of unrestrained
   consumption and illustrate the distinct climate impacts of different
   greenhouse gases under sustained emissions. (Note that here and for all
   other scenarios, we only model aggregated global totals, and the
   consumption described is assumed to lead directly to the associated
   production (and hence emissions). We do not address issues surrounding,
   for example, food waste, access, and distribution, despite their
   importance in designing a sustainable food system (Garnett, 2013), as
   our focus is on demonstrating the relevant climatic principles).

   The second scenario assumes the same very high consumption rates for
   the first 100 years, followed by an exponential decline, i.e.,
   consumption is a function of time C(t) such that:

   where C[m] is the peak (and in this scenario, also initial) consumption
   rate, which declines after time t[m] (= 100 years) with time constant,
   τ = 50 years. This scenario illustrates the difference between
   long-term warming impacts of each gas when their emissions decline
   toward 0.

   The third scenario presents a more realistic demonstration and attempts
   to illustrate a potentially sustainable space for meat consumption.
   Meat consumption starts at a rate approximately equal to current global
   consumption (5.55 kg per capita per annum for a population of 7.3
   billion, following Pierrehumbert and Eshel, 2015), then increases
   exponentially to reach a peak consumption rate of 25 kg per capita per
   annum for a population of 10 billion after 100 years. Following this
   peak, consumption declines exponentially to a long-term annual
   consumption rate (C[∞]) equivalent to 75% of current global
   consumption. Beef consumption is therefore defined as:

Climate Modeling Approach

   Temperature responses were derived using an energy-balance climate
   modeling approach following Pierrehumbert and Eshel (2015). Annual
   emissions of each gas, as determined by the system type and consumption
   trajectories described above, are used to determine the change in
   radiative forcing and consequently warming over time.

   Carbon dioxide forcing was calculated using a function that models
   change in atmospheric concentration of CO[2], incorporating ocean
   uptake, and a logarithmic relationship between changes in CO[2]
   concentration and resultant forcing (following Pierrehumbert, 2014).
   For CH[4] and N[2]O, atmospheric concentrations were calculated
   assuming the gases persist in the atmosphere for 12 and 114 years,
   respectively, with forcing derived from these concentrations using
   linearized radiative efficiency coefficients from Forster et al.
   (2007). For CH[4] this forcing was increased by a factor of 1.45 to
   incorporate stratospheric water vapor amplification and positive ozone
   feedbacks.

   The transient energy balance climate model presented in Pierrehumbert
   (2014) was used to calculate warming resulting from these changes in
   forcing. A two-box ocean system is used whereby a shallow, mixed ocean
   layer warms rapidly (within years) in response to changes in forcing,
   but the deep ocean is warmed (through this mixed layer) on a much
   longer timescale. This two-box ocean system has the important effect of
   adding a delayed warming response, which can also result in some
   continued warming even when forcing is stable or declining (Held et
   al., 2010). An equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3 K per doubling in
   the atmospheric concentration of CO[2] and a short-term transient
   climate sensitivity 2/3 of the equilibrium sensitivity were assumed.
   All climate model outputs are provided in a Supplementary Table in
   addition to being illustrated in the results section below.

Results

   The first consumption pathway, continuous consumption at very high
   rates (Figure 1) illustrates the scale of warming that would result
   from large-scale meat production from current beef cattle or
   hypothesized cultured meat systems. This scenario also demonstrates the
   distinct climate impacts of each gas. As illustrated for the warming
   resulting from each gas in the Brazilian pasture system (Figure 1A),
   there is immediate, significant warming from CH[4], but under sustained
   emission rates this largely stops increasing after a few decades (by
   this point the atmospheric concentration of CH[4] has reached an
   equilibrium, and hence the forcing it results in remains the same, but
   there is still a slight long-term increase in warming due to the
   significant time lag for the temperature response of the deep ocean).
   This equilibrating dynamic is also observed for N[2]O, but on a scale
   of a few centuries rather than a few decades. In contrast, as a
   significant proportion of CO[2] emissions persist indefinitely, no
   equilibrium forcing is reached for this gas, and hence warming
   continues to increase for as long as emissions are sustained. These
   dynamics are illustrated very strongly by comparing cattle to a
   cultured meat production system (Figure 1B). Cultured meat emissions of
   CH[4] and N[2]O are relatively small and so do not significantly
   contribute to overall warming dynamics; instead we see a long-term
   perpetual increase in warming driven largely by the rate of on-going
   CO[2] emissions.
   FIGURE 1
   www.frontiersin.org

   Figure 1. Warming impact for perpetual consumption at very high rates
   (250 Mt per year) for beef cattle and cultured meat production systems
   for 1,000 years. (A,B) illustrate the individual and combined warming
   impact of separate greenhouse gases for representative beef cattle (A)
   and cultured (B) systems. (C–E) show total warming impacts for all
   systems.

   The wider system comparisons provide further demonstrations of these
   dynamics. Among the beef cattle production systems (Figure 1C), the
   Mid-Western USA pasture system shows a much greater degree of long-term
   warming than the Brazilian system, despite only a marginally higher
   carbon dioxide equivalent footprint, due to the greater proportion of
   CO[2]. The Swedish ranch system compares favorably to both, as the
   CO[2]component is low and hence we see limited long-term increase in
   warming, but due to greater production efficiency than the Brazilian
   system, CH[4] (and N[2]O) emissions are also lower, and hence the
   forcing that results once atmospheric concentrations reach equilibrium
   is less. Among the cultured meat production systems (Figure 1D), the
   warming is driven largely (or entirely for “cultured-a” and “-b”) by
   CO[2] emissions, and so there is perpetually increasing warming, the
   slope of which depends on the rate of annual CO[2] emissions. Despite
   concerns over the potential omission of some CH[4] and N[2]O emissions
   in the cultured-a and -b footprints as noted above, the marginal impact
   of these gases for cultured-c, where these data were available,
   suggests that overall trends would be similar.

   Bringing all system types together (Figure 1E) we see that the two most
   optimistic cultured meat footprints, cultured-a and cultured-b, are
   sufficiently small that these systems do indeed have a lesser climate
   impact than cattle systems. These two cultured meat systems remain
   superior to even the best beef cattle production system into the very
   long term (1,000 years), although their relative advantage declines
   over time and by the end of the period modeled is significantly less
   than might be implied by comparing carbon dioxide equivalent footprints
   (cultured-a footprint = 1.69 kg CO[2]e kg^−1 meat, Swedish = 28.6; but
   by t = 1,000 the temperature impacts are +0.18 and +0.62 K,
   respectively). The most striking example of these dynamics is provided
   by cultured-d, the production scenario at the high-end of the
   sensitivity analysis in Mattick et al. (2015b). Despite having a lower
   carbon dioxide equivalent footprint that all cattle systems here,
   within 200 years of continued production the Swedish system is
   superior, and by 450 years is outperformed by even the worst cattle
   system here (despite having only 57% of its carbon dioxide equivalent
   footprint). This system is then increasingly outperformed by all of the
   cattle systems the longer that production is maintained.

   An alternative aspect of the different temporal dynamics of each gas is
   revealed by the scenarios in which production declines toward zero
   after 100 years, as shown in Figure 2. Once emissions of CH[4] and
   N[2]O cease the warming these emissions resulted in is reversed over
   timescales largely dependent on the atmospheric lifespan of each gas
   (Figure 2A). In contrast, the warming due to CO[2] is not reversible
   within the timescales modeled here, and so warming caused by CO[2]
   persists (shown more clearly in Figure 2B). As a result, while the
   warming from cattle (Figure 2C) systems declines, the warming from
   cultured meat production persists indefinitely at a fixed level based
   on the cumulative CO[2] emissions accrued up to the point at which
   production ceases (Figure 2D).

   year) followed by a decline to zero for beef cattle and cultured meat
   production systems for 1,000 years. (A,B) illustrate the individual and
   combined warming impact of separate greenhouse gases for representative
   beef cattle (A) and cultured (B) systems. (C–E) show total warming
   impacts for all systems.

   The potentially more realistic scenario of an increase in consumption
   followed by a decline to more sustainable levels is shown in Figure 3.
   For the Brazilian beef cattle systems (Figure 3A), the warming
   resulting from CH[4] and N[2]O grows rapidly in line-with increasing
   production, but then stabilizes at a new, lower level responding to the
   new emissions rates. For CO[2], however (again shown more clearly in
   the cultured meat example, Figure 3B), the reduction in emissions rate
   slows the rate of further warming, but this is added to the warming
   caused by historical emissions, which persists. The overall
   consequences of these dynamics depend on our climate objectives. The
   cattle production systems show greater peak warming within this
   time-frame (except for the comparison between the Swedish system and
   the highest footprint cultured meat system), but as a result of the
   persistence of the large-scale CO[2] emissions in the early periods of
   production for cultured meat, any long-term benefits of this production
   are further reduced compared to cattle systems.

Discussion

   As originally stated in Pierrehumbert and Eshel (2015), the temperature
   impacts of very large levels of beef consumption, under any of the
   systems explored here, are significant and likely incompatible with our
   climate goals. Despite the bold claims and superior carbon dioxide
   equivalent footprints, however, cultured meat is not necessarily a more
   sustainable alternative. In the most optimistic cultured meat
   production footprints, emissions are competitive with cattle systems
   for CO[2] while avoiding the other gases: this is unambiguously
   superior from a climate perspective. However, the long-term advantage
   over cattle is not as dramatic as may be suggested by simple GWP[100]
   comparisons. For the most conservative cultured meat footprint used
   here, which still had a lower carbon dioxide equivalent footprint than
   any cattle system in the study, the long-term temperature impact of
   production is dramatically worse than any cattle system. Furthermore,
   as emissions from cultured meat are predominantly composed of CO[2],
   their warming legacy persists even if production declines or ceases (in
   the absence of active removal of this CO[2] from the atmosphere).
   Replacing cattle systems with cultured meat production before energy
   generation is sufficiently decarbonized and/or the more optimistic
   production footprints presented here are realized (assuming they can
   be), could risk a long-term, negative climate impact.

   In this study, beef was selected as the livestock meat to compare with
   cultured systems due to its especially high carbon dioxide equivalent
   footprint. It is striking how poorly these footprints correspond to
   long-term temperature impact, indicating the significant influence of
   the different atmospheric lifespan of each gas not adequately captured
   by the GWP[100] metric. The 100-years time-frame demonstrates the
   increasing divergence between GWP[100] footprints and warming impact,
   but the relative exaggeration of the impacts of sustained methane
   emissions is apparent well before this (any period beyond 100 years).
   GWP[100] CO[2] equivalents also fail to highlight some of the
   significant shorter-term differences between methane and CO[2], neither
   reflecting the immediate (within ~20 years) large-scale impacts of
   initially increasing methane emissions nor capturing the reversal of
   warming resulting from decreasing (or halting) emissions (which is also
   the case for nitrous oxide in the longer-term).

   As on-going emissions of short-lived gases such as methane behave so
   differently to CO[2], even over immediate, policy-relevant timescales,
   we need to consider alternative appraisals for activities where
   emissions are largely composed of methane: here, cattle production, but
   other biogenic sources such as rice production, or fossil fuel sources
   such as natural gas leakage would need to consider similar dynamics. It
   is not sufficient to make broad climate claims based on GWP[100] carbon
   dioxide equivalent footprints alone. In order to investigate these
   issues, emissions associated with an activity must be provided in a
   disaggregated form allowing the assessment of each gas, yet these data
   are not generally available at present, and we urge researchers to
   provide them in the future (Lynch, 2019).

   It has been argued that as the emissions from cultured meat are
   primarily from energy use, they may be significantly reduced in the
   future if energy generation is decoupled from emissions (Tuomisto and
   Teixeira de Mattos, 2011)—and given the long timeframe used here, large
   scale energy decarbonization will be essential well within this period
   to prevent very significant climate impacts irrespective of any
   emissions associated with food production. In the least optimistic
   cultured meat scenario here, however, the magnitude of energy required
   is such that sufficient decarbonized energy generation appears unlikely
   in the near to medium term. Assuming an energy footprint of
   approximately 360 MJ per kg cultured meat (high-end of the sensitivity
   analysis in Mattick et al., 2015b), the production of 25 kg per capita
   per annum for a global population of 10 billion would require around 90
   EJ energy per annum, 22.9% of the 393 EJ total global energy
   consumption in 2015 (International Energy Agency, 2017); hence
   unrestrained consumption would result in a significant proportion of
   global energy supply going toward growing lab-grown meat in the absence
   of low-energy production systems.

   Decarbonized energy generation would also eliminate a proportion of the
   CO[2] emissions from cattle systems, and so for this analysis we used
   footprints as presented under contemporary energy emissions
   assumptions. Additionally, the timing of a large-scale decarbonization
   of energy generation would have significant impacts on wider climate
   targets, including determining the extent of on-going methane emissions
   that are compatible with a given temperature ceiling. As cultured meat
   is an emerging technology, wider improvements in efficiency of
   production may reduce its emissions footprint in the future, in
   addition to the decarbonization of energy generation. This, too, could
   also apply to cattle systems though, employing mitigations or
   technologies or moving to more efficient systems (Rivera-Ferre et al.,
   2016).

   Indeed, it could be argued that comparing extant cattle production with
   hypothesized cultured meat systems presents a biased parallel. The
   speculative nature of all four cultured meat footprints tested here is
   borne of necessity, as to date there are no LCA of actual cultured meat
   production (at least in the public domain), despite manufacturer claims
   that a commercial launch is imminent (Stephens et al., 2018). Given the
   unknowns in this new form of production, we must be aware that impact
   assessments may change, and continue to take a systematic approach
   (Mattick et al., 2015a). There is a need for much greater transparency
   from cultured meat manufacturers, with relevant data available to
   interrogate any environmental claims.

   In addition to the broad nature of each footprint, some specific
   elements of the cultured meat LCA remain unclear due to their
   speculative nature. In the default approaches from Tuomisto and
   Teixeira de Mattos (2011), for example, a proportion of emissions
   incurred in the production of cyanobacteria are not allocated to
   cultured meat, instead presumed assigned to food supplements. The
   potential for any co-products from cultured meat production will depend
   on the systems that might be realized. They should also be handled
   similarly to any co-products from cattle production, such as leather;
   but the treatment of livestock co-products in LCAs can be complex, and
   is not well-standardized at present (Mackenzie et al., 2017).

   The nature of the functional unit—the unit of output to which emissions
   are assigned—also remains speculative in the case of cultured meat. If
   protein rather than “meat” was taken as our functional output the
   footprints would show even greater differences between studies, with
   Mattick et al. (2015b) assuming 7% protein by weight, compared to 19%
   in Tuomisto and Teixeira de Mattos (2011) and Tuomisto et al. (2014).
   Comparing impacts on a per protein (or wider nutritional) basis will be
   important as more detailed and/or real production footprints become
   available. Even with a generic meat functional unit, as used in this
   study, there may still be further differences not captured here. In
   Mattick et al. (2015b) the functional unit is 1 kg of cell biomass: any
   further processing or additional ingredients required to convert this
   biomass into an edible form or a conventional meat product analog would
   also need to be included for a full life cycle assessment comparing
   final meat products. Tuomisto and Teixeira de Mattos (2011) assumed
   their cultured meat system output is a “minced-beef type of product,”
   but may still differ from cattle beef in nutritional or sensory
   attributes, with further processing (and hence steps to consider in a
   life cycle assessment) potentially required if a complete beef analog
   is sought. The impacts of any processes to produce different meat
   products, such as steaks, may be even greater, and more complex tissue
   engineering of this type is not anticipated in the near-future
   (Stephens et al., 2018). Processing of livestock products can also be
   associated with considerable emissions (Poore and Nemecek, 2018), and
   so system boundaries must consistently include these in future work
   comparing environmental impacts of final products ready for
   consumption.

   Spared land-use has been presented as another significant advantage of
   cultured meat production (Tuomisto and Teixeira de Mattos, 2011), and
   this land could entail a further climate benefit by being used for
   carbon sequestration. This may also be a factor in improved cattle
   production however, including simply more efficient use of current
   grasslands (Godde et al., 2018). Land-use associated carbon fluxes are
   often poorly standardized in agricultural footprinting approaches
   (Adewale et al., 2018), and were excluded here. These land-use carbon
   fluxes may have significant impacts. For example, significant
   deforestation has resulted from pasture expansion, and including the
   CO[2] emissions resulting from this would greatly increase typical
   Brazilian beef footprints (Cederberg et al., 2011). At the same time,
   grassland soils contain significant quantities of organic carbon, and
   could potentially sequester even greater amounts under appropriate
   management (Conant et al., 2017). Further detail and standardization in
   land-use emissions and sequestrations is required in the future,
   including an appraisal of likely alternative land-uses following
   sparing of current agricultural land.

   Although this study is concerned with the climate impacts of meat
   production, a wider context must also be considered. A number of other
   environmental impacts are associated with beef production, such as
   water pollution and acidification (Poore and Nemecek, 2018), and
   cultured meat may provide benefits in these wider impacts; but again,
   caution should be advised until reliable LCAs are available for actual
   production systems. Conversely, we must also consider the wider
   benefits that might be provided from meat production systems, including
   associated co-products, the provision of ecosystem services, their
   socioeconomic role in rural communities, and their landscape or
   cultural value (Rodríguez-Ortega et al., 2014). It has been argued that
   cultured meat production is a potentially transformative technology,
   and so social assessments must also be made to anticipate the
   disruption (positive or negative) that may be caused (Mattick et al.,
   2015c), alongside environmental impacts such as climate change. As a
   concept, it has been suggested that cultured meat overcomes some of the
   ethical problems of livestock production (Schaefer and Savulescu,
   2014), but has also been criticized as a problematically
   techno-centric, profit-motivated approach (Metcalf, 2013). Hocquette
   (2016) questions the broad need for cultured meat, suggesting that
   there are already alternative solutions that we could employ to
   overcome problems with our food system. Finally, any climatic or wider
   benefits that may be possible through replacing livestock systems with
   cultured meat depends on how people perceive and ultimately consume
   cultured meat products (i.e., as a direct replacement or in addition to
   conventional livestock products). Early research suggests consumer
   reluctance to replace conventional with cultured meat, with public
   willingness to eat cultured meat dependent on a number of personal
   concerns and anticipated benefits (Bryant and Barnett, 2018).

Conclusions

   The scale of cattle production required for the very high levels of
   beef consumption modeled here would result in significant global
   warming, but it is not yet clear whether cultured meat production would
   provide a more climatically sustainable alternative. The climate
   impacts of cultured meat production will depend on what level of
   decarbonized energy generation can be achieved, and the specific
   environmental footprints of production. There is a need for detailed
   and transparent LCA of real cultured meat production systems. Based on
   currently available data, cultured production does not necessarily give
   license for unrestrained meat consumption.

   Coral reefs are found in a wide range of environments, where they
   provide food and habitat to a large range of organisms as well as
   providing many other ecological goods and services. Warm-water coral
   reefs, for example, occupy shallow sunlit, warm, and alkaline waters in
   order to grow and calcify at the high rates necessary to build and
   maintain their calcium carbonate structures. At deeper locations
   (40–150 m), “mesophotic” (low light) coral reefs accumulate calcium
   carbonate at much lower rates (if at all in some cases) yet remain
   important as habitat for a wide range of organisms, including those
   important for fisheries. Finally, even deeper, down to 2,000 m or more,
   the so-called “cold-water” coral reefs are found in the dark depths.
   Despite their importance, coral reefs are facing significant challenges
   from human activities including pollution, over-harvesting, physical
   destruction, and climate change. In the latter case, even lower
   greenhouse gas emission scenarios (such as Representative Concentration
   Pathway RCP 4.5) are likely drive the elimination of most warm-water
   coral reefs by 2040–2050. Cold-water corals are also threatened by
   warming temperatures and ocean acidification although evidence of the
   direct effect of climate change is less clear. Evidence that coral
   reefs can adapt at rates which are sufficient for them to keep up with
   rapid ocean warming and acidification is minimal, especially given that
   corals are long-lived and hence have slow rates of evolution.
   Conclusions that coral reefs will migrate to higher latitudes as they
   warm are equally unfounded, with the observations of tropical species
   appearing at high latitudes “necessary but not sufficient” evidence
   that entire coral reef ecosystems are shifting. On the contrary, coral
   reefs are likely to degrade rapidly over the next 20 years, presenting
   fundamental challenges for the 500 million people who derive food,
   income, coastal protection, and a range of other services from coral
   reefs. Unless rapid advances to the goals of the Paris Climate Change
   Agreement occur over the next decade, hundreds of millions of people
   are likely to face increasing amounts of poverty and social disruption,
   and, in some cases, regional insecurity.

Introduction

   Both warm- and cold-water corals secrete calcium carbonate skeletons
   that build up over time to create a three-dimensional reef matrix that
   provides habitat for thousands of fish and other species. The
   production of limestone-like calcium carbonate is high enough in many
   warm-water coral reefs to establish carbonate structures. High rates of
   calcification are sufficient to overcome significant rates of
   bioerosion and wave driven physical erosion. These structures underpin
   the framework of barrier reefs and islands, which are critically
   important to tropical coastlines. Although they occupy less than 0.1%
   of the ocean floor, tropical coral reef ecosystems provide habitat for
   at least 25% of known marine species, with many reef species still to
   be discovered (Fisher et al., 2015). The biological diversity of
   warm-water coral reefs has been estimated to include ~1–9 million
   species that live in and around coral reefs (Reaka-Kudla, 1997, Census
   of Marine Life,
   http://www.coml.org/census-coral-reef-ecosystems-creefs). In deeper
   parts of these warm-water reef systems, the tendency toward carbonate
   dominated reef structures diminishes as light levels decrease
   (Bongaerts et al., 2010a). At low light levels, erosion and dissolution
   exceed calcium carbonate production, leading to coral communities that
   may be abundant yet with little or no three-dimensional calcium
   carbonate reef framework. Extending from 40 to 150 m, these
   “mesophotic” (low light) coral reefs also provide extensive habitat,
   with the rates of discovery of species remaining very high due to these
   reefs being difficult to visit (Bongaerts et al., 2010a, 2011).
   Mesophotic reef systems probably cover a comparable area to shallow
   warm-water coral reefs (Bongaerts et al., 2010a; Slattery et al.,
   2011).

   Both shallow or deeper mesophotic coral reefs are dominated by
   scleractinian corals that form symbiosis with dinoflagellate protists
   from the genus, Symbiodinium. On the basis of this symbiosis, their
   intracellular symbionts (i.e., living within the gastrodermal or
   digestive tissues of their coral hosts) are able to photosynthesize and
   provide the host coral with a rich source of sugars, glycerol, lipids,
   and other organic compounds (Muscatine, 1990). This relationship
   enables corals to grow and calcify at high rates in the clear, warm,
   and shallow water conditions along tropical coastlines (Muscatine and
   Porter, 1977). The abundance of Scleractinian corals hosting
   Symbiodinium decreases with depth beyond 20–40 m, depending on the
   clarity of the water column. The deepest Scleractinian corals that are
   symbiotic with Symbiodinium, are found 100 m or more below the surface
   of tropical waters (Englebert et al., 2014). The productivity of this
   symbiosis is complemented by the ability of corals to capture and feed
   on waterborne particles and plankton (i.e., polytrophy). The combined
   ability to photosynthesise, as well as feed, underpins the success of
   the highly productive coral reef ecosystems that line many tropical
   coastlines. Evidence from isotope signatures within fossils reveal that
   Scleractinian corals have been symbiotic with Symbiodinium for over 230
   million years (Stanley and Fautin, 2001; Muscatine et al., 2005), most
   probably driving productive and diverse ecosystems that were not too
   different from those of today.

   Cold-water coral reefs extend to depths of 3,000 m although some
   cold-water corals can be found growing in waters as shallow as 50 m
   (e.g., Norwegian shelf). Below 200 m depth there is so little light
   that photosynthesis is no longer possible. As a result, cold-water
   corals do not form a symbiosis with Symbiodinium and depend instead on
   particle feeding. Discoveries of the locations and extent of cold-water
   reefs has primarily been driven by advances in underwater technologies
   for surveying and mapping (Turley et al., 2007; Ramirez-Llodra et al.,
   2010). For example, vast extents (~2,000 km^2) of cold-water coral
   reefs, some shown to be thousands of years old (>8,000 years), have
   been found in Norwegian waters in past decades (Fosså et al., 2005).
   Cold-water coral reefs have now been discovered in every ocean, forming
   important assemblages within the deep ocean that provide critical
   habitat to thousands of other species, including many commercially
   important species.

   Human communities derive many benefits from coral reefs including food,
   income, recreation, coastal protection, cultural settings, and many
   other ecological goods and services (Cinner et al., 2009; Costanza et
   al., 2014). Despite their biological diversity, productivity and
   importance to humans, both warm and cold-water coral reefs are being
   heavily impacted by human activities due to both local and global
   influences (Hall-Spencer et al., 2002; Burke et al., 2011). As a
   result, many coral reefs are rapidly declining across the world. While
   local factors can have significant impact on coral reefs (e.g.,
   pollution, overfishing, and the physical destruction of reefs), changes
   in ocean temperature and chemistry due to anthropogenic activities are
   dramatically reducing the distribution, abundance, and survival of
   entire coral reef ecosystems (Gattuso et al., 2014b; Hoegh-Guldberg et
   al., 2014). Given these risks and the importance of coral reefs to
   humans and marine biodiversity, the present paper focuses on the
   challenges that warm and cold-water coral reef ecosystems and their
   human communities are facing, particularly those posed by rapidly
   warming and acidifying oceans.

Distribution, Abundance, and Importance of Coral Reef Ecosystems

   Warm-water coral reefs are prominent ecosystems within coastal areas of
   the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic oceans (Figures 1A,B), where they are
   typically found in a broad band (30°S to 30°N) of warm, sunlit,
   alkaline, clear, and relatively nutrient deficient ocean waters
   (Kleypas et al., 1999b). Here, Scleractinian or reef-building corals
   proliferate, depositing copious amounts of calcium carbonate. As corals
   die, their dead skeletons build up over time and are “glued” together
   by the activities of other organisms such as encrusting red coralline
   algae (Glynn and Manzello, 2015). Other organisms such as calcifying
   green algae, invertebrates, and phytoplankton also contribute to the
   overall carbonate budget of warm water coral reefs (Hutchings and
   Hoegh-Guldberg, 2009), leading to three-dimensional calcium carbonate
   structures that build up over hundreds and thousands of years. In turn,
   the three-dimensional structures (Figure 1C) within warm-water reef
   systems creates habitat for hundreds of thousands of species, many of
   which support coastal human populations with food, income, and other
   ecological goods and services such as coastal protection. Coral reefs
   are also important sources for bio-prospecting and the development of
   novel pharmaceuticals. The asset value of coral reefs has been
   estimated as close to $1 trillion (Hoegh-Guldberg, 2015) with the
   economic value of goods and services from coral reefs exceeding $375
   billion annually, with benefits flowing to over 500 million people in
   at least 90 countries worldwide (Burke et al., 2011; Gattuso et al.,
   2014b).

   As light levels decrease with depth, decalcification dominates and the
   overall carbonate balance of reef ecosystems shifts to negative (Barnes
   and Chalker, 1990; Bongaerts et al., 2010a). Under these conditions,
   Scleractinian corals and their symbionts persist with reefs being
   referred to as “mesophotic” (Bongaerts et al., 2010a, 2011; Robinson C.
   et al., 2010). In these habitats, colonies of Scleractinian corals are
   often platelike in shape, orientating themselves to maximize light
   harvesting under these dim light conditions (Figure 1D). Mesophotic
   reef systems are also primarily restricted to areas where water
   clarity, carbonate ion concentrations, and temperatures are relatively
   high. Like their counterparts in shallower regions, mesophotic reef
   systems play an important role in supporting fisheries and hence human
   livelihoods. Given the difficulty of working at depths of more than 30
   m (beyond SCUBA-diving depth) many species remain to be discovered
   (Bongaerts et al., 2010a). Mesophotic reefs therefore have an unknown
   potential to be sources of novel pharmaceuticals and other potentially
   beneficial compounds (Leal et al., 2012). As a result, their true value
   has probably been underestimated.

   Cold-water corals generally form reefs at much greater depths from 200
   to 2,000 m however in some regions they are found at shallower depths
   (Fosså et al., 2002; Freiwald et al., 2004). Deep-water corals are not
   dependent on light levels as they are not symbiotic with Symbiodinium.
   Due to the colder and more CO[2] rich (and hence less alkaline) waters,
   deep-water corals grow slower than warm-water corals, forming
   aggregations that are variously termed patches, banks, thickets,
   bioherms, mounds, gardens, and massifs. In the absence of significant
   wave action, these fragile and slow growing reefs form aggregations
   that can cover vast tracks of the seabed (e.g., 2,000 km^2 in Norwegian
   waters http://www.lophelia.org/) (Hall-Spencer et al., 2002) and
   involve near mono-specific stands of Scleractinian corals such as
   Lophelia pertusa and Oculina varicosa (Figure 1E). In addition to
   Scleractinian corals, they often exhibit a wide variety of abundant
   coral-like organisms, including soft corals, gorgonians, and
   Alcyonaceans.

Recent Changes in the Extent of Anthropogenic Stresses on Coral Reef
Ecosystems

   Coral reefs are facing growing challenges from the local to global
   effects of human activities. Over the past 200 years, human activities
   have fundamentally changed coastlines, overexploited resources such as
   fish stocks, and polluted coastal waters, to a point where many coral
   reef ecosystems are degrading rapidly (Jackson et al., 2001; Pandolfi
   et al., 2003; Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014b). Warm-water coral reefs, for
   example, have declined by at least 50% over the past 30–50 years in
   large parts of the world's tropical regions (Hughes, 1994; Gardner et
   al., 2003; Bruno and Selig, 2007; De'ath et al., 2012). Similar
   conclusions have been reached for cold-water reefs where human
   activities have put these systems under escalating pressure from the
   mid-1980s onwards. Key drivers of the destruction of cold-water reefs
   include commercial bottom trawling, hydrocarbon exploration and
   production, deep sea mining, cable and pipeline placement, pollution,
   waste disposal, coral exploitation, and trade, and destructive
   scientific sampling (Hall-Spencer et al., 2002; Turley et al., 2007;
   Roberts and Cairns, 2014). The increase in impacts from human
   activities is a result of rapid advances in technologies for
   visualizing and exploiting the biological and mineral resources of deep
   water habitats (Freiwald et al., 2004; Ramirez-Llodra et al., 2010).
   Many populations of deep-sea corals (Scleractinians, gorgonians) have
   very slow turn-over rates and may live for centuries, with some species
   such as black corals (Antipatharians) living for thousands of years.
   The longevity and slow growth rates of these taxa means that recovery
   from anthropogenic stressors will be very slow. The areas inhabited by
   the deep-sea reefs are also a “resource frontier” for hydrocarbon
   extraction and mining of high value and “high-tech” metals (Roberts and
   Cairns, 2014). Hence, it is likely that anthropogenic impacts on these
   reefs will expand. These impacts are also likely to interact with ocean
   warming and acidification (Figure 2A), which pose growing and serious
   risks to coral reef ecosystems on their own. The direct impact of these
   changes to coral reefs have been growing since the early 1980s
   (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007, 2014; Eakin C. M. et al., 2010; Gattuso
   et al., 2014b). The latter are the direct result of the burning of
   fossil fuels and have been driving growing impacts on warm water coral
   reefs since the early 1980s. Understanding and solving both local and
   global threats to coral reefs will be critically important if they are
   to survive some of the greatest rates of environmental change in the
   recent history of the Earth (Hönisch et al., 2012; Pörtner et al.,
   2014).
   FIGURE 2

   Figure 2. (A) Linkages between the build-up of atmospheric CO[2] and
   the slowing of coral calcification due to ocean acidification.
   Approximately 30% of the atmospheric CO[2] emitted by humans has been
   taken up by the ocean (IPCC, 2013) where it combined with water to
   produce carbonic acid, which releases a proton that combines with a
   carbonate ion. This decreases the concentration of carbonate, making it
   unavailable to marine calcifiers such as corals. (B) Temperature,
   [CO[2]][atm], and carbonate-ion concentrations reconstructed for the
   past 420,000 years. Carbonate concentrations were calculated (Lewis et
   al., 1998) from [CO[2]][atm] and temperature deviations from conditions
   in the decade of the 2000s with the Vostok Ice Core data set (Petit et
   al., 1999), assuming constant salinity (34 parts per trillion), mean
   sea temperature (25°C), and total alkalinity (2,300 mmol kg^−1).
   Acidity of the ocean varies by ± 0.1 pH units over the past 420,000
   years (individual values not shown). The thresholds for major changes
   to coral communities are indicated for thermal stress (+2°C) and
   carbonate-ion concentrations ([carbonate] = 200 μmol kg^−1, approximate
   aragonite saturation ~Ω[aragonite] = 3.3; [CO[2]][atm] = 480 ppm).
   Coral Reef Scenarios CRS-A, CRS-B, and CRS-C are indicated as A, B, and

   Warm-water coral reefs are largely dependent on the physical and
   chemical changes occurring in the surface of the ocean, whereas
   cold-water reef systems are tied relatively more to the broad scale
   conditions of the bulk ocean (Freiwald et al., 2004; Eakin C. M. et
   al., 2010). In this respect, there are likely to be differences in
   terms of the rate and characteristics of the changes that are
   occurring. These differences also translate into different trajectories
   when it comes to near and long-term projections of planetary warming
   and ocean acidification.

   Warm-water coral reef environments have experienced relatively small
   amounts of variability in terms of temperature and carbonate ion
   concentrations, even with the relatively substantial swings in average
   global temperature and atmospheric CO[2] concentration during the
   glacial cycle (Figure 2B). Warm-water coral reefs contracted toward the
   equator during glacial periods, and re-expanded along the tropical and
   subtropical coastlines of the world during the intervening warm periods
   (Hubbard, 2015). While these changes were rapid relative to geological
   time frames, they occurred over periods of 10,000 years or more and are
   slow when compared to climatic changes that have occurred since
   pre-industrial. While our understanding of how conditions have changed
   in terms of the habitat of deep-water coral reefs over geological time
   is limited, it is very likely that conditions varied even less over
   these long periods than those surrounding the warm-water coral reefs.

   It is virtually certain that the upper ocean has warmed between 1971
   and 2010 and likely that it has warmed between 1870s and 1971 (IPCC,
   2013). These changes are consistent with those expected from the
   associated rise in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere
   (IPCC, 2013). The average sea surface temperatures (SST) of the Indian,
   Atlantic, and Pacific oceans have increased by 0.65, 0.41, and 0.31°C
   during 1950–2009 (Table 30-1 in Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014). The
   influence of long-term patterns of climate variability such as the
   Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) contribute to variability at regional
   scales and confound efforts to detect and attribute regional changes to
   anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014).
   Nonetheless, examination of the Hadley Centre HadISST1.1 data (Rayner
   et al., 2003) over 60 years (1950–2009) reveals significant warming
   trends in SST for many sub-regions of the ocean (Table 30-1 in
   Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014). Significant trends are clearly
   demonstrated within the six major warm-water coral reef regions, with
   the exception of the Gulf of Mexico/Caribbean Sea region (Table 1).
   Rates of increase in SST in the warm-water coral reef regions range
   from 0.07°C (west Pacific Ocean) to 0.13°C (Coral Triangle and
   southeast Asia) per decade, resulting in an overall increase in the
   regions of between 0.44 and 0.79°C during the period from 1950 to 2009.

   warm-water coral reef provinces (Figure 1B) over the period 1950–2009
   using 1 × 1 degree monthly SST data extracted from the Hadley Centre
   HadISST1.1 data set (Rayner et al., 2003).

   In addition to the heat content and temperature of the upper layers of
   the ocean, the research community is virtually certain that ocean
   chemistry is also changing as a result of the increasing amounts of
   CO[2] entering the Ocean (IPCC, 2013). Observed increases in salinity
   at tropical latitudes are consistent with the amplification of the
   global hydrological cycle (Durack and Wijffels, 2010; Durack et al.,
   2012), including rainfall, which have significant implications for
   coastal ecosystems such as warm-water coral reefs. At regional levels,
   changes in storm and rainfall intensity also have the potential to
   influence coastal water quality, which is important to coral reefs, as
   a result of the interplay between droughts, coastal and catchment
   erosion, and sudden inundation (flood) events. The impact of climate
   change adds to those from other human activities that are already
   impacting water quality, coastal erosion and biological systems.

   Average global sea levels are increasing by an average of 3.2 mm
   year^−1 (over 1993–2010) as a result of warming of the ocean (thus
   increasing volume) and the melting of land ice (IPCC, 2013). Sea level
   rise varies between regions as a result of differences in local
   oceanography and geology and the influence of long-term variation in
   regional climate. Some areas that have significant warm-water coral
   reefs, such as Southeast Asia and northern Australia, have reported
   rates of sea level rise of around 10 mm year^−1. While the direct
   attribution of changes in regional wind strength, storm intensity and
   frequency to global warming is challenging due to long-term
   variability, there is considerable evidence that the frequency and
   intensity of the strongest tropical storms in some regions (e.g., North
   Atlantic; IPCC, 2013) has increased since the 1970s. The combination of
   higher sea levels and more intense storm systems is likely to increase
   the amount of force exerted by wave action on coastal areas, which has
   implications for coastal infrastructure, as well as the state of
   ecosystems such as coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass beds (Hamylton
   et al., 2013; Saunders et al., 2014).

   Changes have also occurred in the pH of ocean surface waters over the
   past 100 years, a phenomenon which is referred to as ocean
   acidification (Kleypas et al., 1999a; Caldeira and Wickett, 2003;
   Gattuso et al., 2014a). As CO[2] enters the ocean, it reacts with water
   increasing hydrogen ion concentration (thus decreasing ocean pH) and
   decreasing the carbonate ion concentration. While the overall change in
   ocean pH appears small (0.1 pH units over the past 150 years), this is
   actually a 26% increase in the concentration of hydrogen ions.
   Experimental evidence shows a reduction in carbonate ions with ocean
   acidification is biologically significant, since it can affect the rate
   at which marine organisms, such as corals build their calcareous
   structures (Kroeker et al., 2013). However, understanding of the
   mechanisms driving the sensitivity of coral calcification to ocean
   chemistry, such as the response of the pH of the internal calcifying
   fluid in which the coral skeleton forms to the concentration of
   dissolved organic carbon, are only being untangled (Comeau et al.,
   2017). These changes in ocean chemistry are temperature dependent, with
   the CO[2] absorption and consequently acidification being highest when
   waters are cooler. The aragonite (one form of calcium carbonate)
   saturation state (Ω[arag]) is essentially the ratio between the
   concentrations of calcium and carbonate ions (Doney et al., 2009). The
   aragonite saturation state shows a similar distribution to sea surface
   temperature with Ω[arag] being highest in the warmest ocean regions and
   lowest in polar regions (Jiang et al., 2015). Surface waters of the
   ocean are generally supersaturated with respect to aragonite (Ω[arag] >
   1). However, in warmer waters where Ω[arag] is not projected to fall to
   <1 (thus undersaturated with respect to aragonite, Figure 3),
   substantial impacts are likely to still occur on calcifying organisms.
   There is substantial evidence that carbonate accretion on warm-water
   coral reefs approaches zero or becomes negative when Ω[arag] falls
   below 3.3 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007; Chan and Connolly, 2013), a
   level likely to be reached in tropical surface waters within the next
   few decades at current rates of greenhouse gas emission (Hoegh-Guldberg
   et al., 2007; Ricke et al., 2013).

   the University of Victoria Earth System Model under different
   atmospheric concentrations of CO[2]. 280 ppm represents pre-industrial
   and 394 ppm levels in 2012. Four hundred and fifty ppm is projected to
   be reached during 2030s under Representative Concentration Pathway
   (RCP) 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5, and to approach, but not reach 450 ppm, during
   2040s under RCP 2.6 (IPCC 2013). Eight hundred ppm is projected to be
   reached during 2080s under RCP 8.5 only. Fields are calculated from the
   model output of dissolved inorganic carbon concentration, alkalinity
   concentration, temperature, and salinity, together with the chemistry
   routine from the OCMIP-3 project. Modified from Figure SM30-2 in
   Hoegh-Guldberg et al. (2014; reprinted with permission of IPCC AR5).

   The global distribution of cold-water corals is at least partly limited
   by the depth of the aragonite saturation horizon, Ω[arag] = 1.0
   (Guinotte et al., 2006). Aragonite saturation state diminishes with
   depth, due partly to hydrostatic pressure and lower temperature, with a
   distinct aragonite “saturation horizon” below which waters become
   under-saturated for aragonite (Ω[arag] <1) (Jiang et al., 2015). The
   saturation horizon is a complex outcome of ocean circulation,
   temperature, CO[2] concentrations, salinity, metabolic activity, and
   the concentrations of organic compounds and occurs at depths between
   200 and 3,500 m, depending on the latitude and the ocean (Orr et al.,
   2005; Doney et al., 2009; Rhein et al., 2013; Jiang et al., 2015).
   Surface waters and waters at 50 m depth are mostly supersaturated
   throughout the global ocean (Jiang et al., 2015), however in western
   Arctic waters, the area of under-saturated waters in the upper 250 m
   north of 70°N has increased from 5 to 31% between 1990s and 2010 (Qi et
   al., 2017). At 500 m, large areas of undersaturated Ω[arag] water are
   found in the northern and equatorial Pacific ocean. At 1,000 m, Ω[arag]
   < 1.8 over all ocean basins and at 2.000 m, Ω[arag] < 1.0 across all
   the Pacific and Indian Ocean and parts of the Atlantic Ocean. Ocean
   acidification is proceeding at higher rates at high latitudes than at
   lower latitudes (Figure 3) resulting in a shoaling of the aragonite
   saturation horizon. There is now evidence to show that the aragonite
   saturation horizon has shoaled since the Preindustrial Period (Turley
   et al., 2007). For example, in the north east Pacific (from 33.5 to
   50.0°N) the aragonite saturation horizon has shoaled by 19.6 m in 11
   years (2001–2012) and, at this rate, the entire water column in the
   northern section of this region is projected to become undersaturated
   within 50–90 years (Chu et al., 2016).

Biological Responses to a Rapidly Warming and Acidifying Ocean

   Not surprisingly, the scale and pace of the physical and chemical
   changes occurring in the ocean are driving a large range of fundamental
   responses in marine organisms, ecosystems, and regions (Hoegh-Guldberg
   et al., 2014; Pörtner et al., 2014). Equally significant, is the
   observation that relatively small amounts of change have resulted in
   quite substantial biological impacts, with clear evidence of non-linear
   trends, tipping points, and otherwise complex responses. Coral
   responses to changes in ocean conditions, in particular mass coral
   bleaching, provide particularly compelling examples of the consequences
   of a rapidly changing ocean for organisms, ecosystems, and dependent
   societies.

   The symbiosis between warm-water corals and Symbiodinium (Figures 4A,B)
   is very sensitive to changes in the physical and chemical environment
   surrounding corals. Short periods of high or low temperature and/or
   light, or exposure to toxins like cyanide, can drive the breakdown of
   the symbiosis, resulting in the loss of the brown symbionts and a
   subsequent paling (hence “bleaching”) of the coral host
   (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999). Coral bleaching involves the breakdown of the
   symbiosis between Scleractinian corals and Symbiodinium, which may
   recover if conditions are not too anomalous for too long. While
   bleaching of coral tissues has been reported on the scale of colonies
   or groups of colonies for at least 100 years (Yonge and Nichols, 1931),
   reports of bleaching at large geographic scales (Figures 4C,D, example
   of affected coral reefs in American Samoa from late 2015) was unknown
   to the scientific literature until 1979. Since the early 1980s,
   however, mass coral bleaching has affected entire reefs and regions,
   often resulting in significant mortality of reef-building corals. The
   absence of pre 1979 scientific reports in addition to the close
   relationship between bleaching and elevated sea temperature, plus
   considerable laboratory, and mesocosm studies, strongly support the
   conclusion that mass coral bleaching and mortality are novel and are
   caused by warm water coral reefs being exposed to rising sea
   temperatures (Hoegh-Guldberg and Smith, 1989; Glynn, 1993, 2012;
   Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Glynn et al., 2001; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007,
   2014; Baker et al., 2008; Eakin C. M. et al., 2010; Strong et al.,
   2011; Gattuso et al., 2014b). The latest cycle of mass coral bleaching
   in 2016 (Hoegh-Guldberg and Ridgway, 2016) is reputedly the worst on
   record and accompanies the warmest years on record (King and Hawkins,
   2016;
   https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-noaa-data-show-2016-warmest-yea
   r-on-record-globally).

   Mass coral bleaching and mortality can be triggered by small (1–2°C)
   SST increases above the long-term summer maxima for a region (Strong et
   al., 2011). If temperatures are higher for longer, the amount of coral
   bleaching will increase, driving increased mortality (Hoegh-Guldberg,
   1999; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007; Eakin C. M. et al., 2010). There is
   a strong link between the size and length of temperature extremes and
   mass coral bleaching and mortality (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Strong et
   al., 2004, 2011; Eakin C. M. et al., 2010). These relationships are
   used with satellite data to derive anomalies in SST to monitor the
   frequency and intensity of mass coral bleaching and mortality (Strong
   et al., 2004, 2011). For this reason, there is a high level of
   confidence that the increases in mass coral bleaching and mortality
   since the early 1980s are due to anthropogenic climate change in
   particular ocean warming (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014). The loss of
   symbionts from coral tissues can have immediate effects through the
   loss of photosynthetic energy, and lead to starvation, disease,
   reproductive failure, and a loss of competitive ability relative to
   other organisms on coral reefs (Hoegh-Guldberg and Smith, 1989; Glynn,
   1993, 2012; Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Baker et al., 2008; Hoegh-Guldberg et
   al., 2014; Glynn and Manzello, 2015).

   Understanding how the positions of ocean isotherms (lines of similar
   temperatures) are changing and how fast across the ocean surface
   (“velocity of climate change”, Burrows et al., 2011, 2014) provides
   insight into whether or not coral populations will be able to move,
   adapt or acclimatize fast enough to changing sea temperatures
   (Hoegh-Guldberg, 2012; Pörtner et al., 2014). Some of the highest rates
   of climate velocity (up to 200 km per decade) were observed in ocean
   tropical regions (over 1960–2010), driven by shallow spatial gradients
   in temperature (Burrows et al., 2011, 2014). Observed rates of
   distribution shifts for individual warm-water coral species linked to
   increases in sea surface temperatures range from 0 to 150 km per
   decade, with an average shift rate of 30 km per decade (Yamano et al.,
   2011; Poloczanska et al., 2013), suggesting that corals and coral
   ecosystems may be unable to keep up with warming rates (Hoegh-Guldberg,
   2012; Burrows et al., 2014; García Molinos et al., 2015).

   The possible reduced influence of extremes from climate change with
   depth has led to the speculation that deeper (>40 m) mesophotic coral
   reefs may offer a potential refuge against the otherwise rapid changes
   in temperature, storm intensity, and chemistry that are typical of
   shallow-water (0–30 m) coral reef environments (Bongaerts et al.,
   2010a). The “Deep Reef Refugia” hypothesis has been explored by a
   number of groups who are finding substantial differences in terms of
   the rate of warming and acidification with depth, as well as examples
   of species that may span the mesophotic zone to shallow reef areas.
   Recent work however, has revealed that mesophotic reefs may not be
   immune to the impacts of storms (Bongaerts et al., 2013). Also,
   populations of what appear to be the same coral species appear to have
   considerable genetic structure as a function of depth. This is
   important given that it implies a high degree of specialization, local
   adaptation, and even speciation, by corals living at different depths,
   with the implication that mesophotic corals may not be able to survive
   in shallow-water environments and vice versa, reducing the potential
   for mesophotic environments to provide refugia for shallow water
   Scleractinian corals. This reduces the significance of deeper water
   populations as a source of recruits for regenerating damaged areas on
   shallow water coral reefs (Bongaerts et al., 2010b, 2015). In addition
   to warming oceans, corals are also sensitive to changes to the pH and
   the carbonate chemistry of seawater as a result of ocean acidification
   (Kleypas et al., 1999a; Gattuso et al., 2014a). These changes affect
   organisms in a variety of ways, including reducing calcification rates
   in a wide array of corals and other organisms in laboratory, mesocosm,
   and field studies (Gattuso et al., 1998; Reynaud et al., 2003; Kleypas
   et al., 2006; Dove et al., 2013; Kroeker et al., 2013; Gattuso et al.,
   2014a).

   Long-lived corals from the field have provided an opportunity for
   retrospective analysis of how growth has varied over long periods of
   time (De'ath et al., 2009; Lough, 2010, 2011). Calcification
   measurements from coral cores from 328 colonies of the massive coral
   Porites growing on the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, for example,
   have revealed that calcification by these corals has declined by 14.2%
   since 1990. This appears to unprecedented on the Great Barrier Reef for
   at least the last 400 years (De'ath et al., 2009) (but see D'Olivo et
   al., 2013; Figure 5). Given the complexity of the environmental changes
   occurring in places like the Great Barrier Reef, it is difficult to
   assign specific drivers of this decline. However, the combined effects
   of elevated warming and acidification from climate change, along with
   declining water quality, appear to be significant drivers of the
   changes observed (D'Olivo et al., 2013). Declining growth and
   calcification rates have also been detected for Porites colonies in the
   Red Sea (Cantin et al., 2010) and at several locations in Southeast
   Asia (Tanzil et al., 2009).

   2005 (A), primarily due to declining extension (B). Density declines
   from 1900 onward (C). The 1572–2001 data show that calcification
   increased weakly from ~1.62 before 1,700 to ~1.76 in ~1850, after which
   it remained relatively constant (D) before a weak decline since ~1960.

   Studies of the influence of rapidly warming and acidifying conditions
   on mesophotic coral reefs are absent. Given that these reef systems
   cover roughly the equivalent area of shallow water coral reefs,
   understanding how environmental changes are likely to influence these
   important areas in terms of habitat the fisheries and biodiversity is
   important and should be a priority of future research (Bongaerts et
   al., 2010a). Linking the physiological and ecological response of
   mesophotic reefs to changes in pH and carbonate ion concentration will
   also be important in the context of understanding how mesophotic coral
   reef ecosystems will be affected by the shoaling of the saturation
   horizon in regions such as off Hawaii.

   Our understanding of how deep ocean environments are likely to respond
   to changes in ocean temperature and chemistry are at an early stage.
   Like mesophotic coral reefs, little is known about the sensitivity of
   cold-water coral reefs to changes in temperature. As cold-water corals
   tend not to have a mutualistic symbiosis with Symbiodinium, their
   response is naturally different to that of symbiotic Scleractinian
   corals. As with mesophotic coral reefs, there is much more to be
   discovered with respect to how these critically important cold-water
   coral reefs are likely to respond to steadily warming and acidifying
   ocean. Coral reefs in the deep-sea have been identified as particularly
   vulnerable to the effects of ocean acidification; in part because of
   the numerical predominance of calcifying taxa, and in part because the
   pre-industrial carbonate levels at the depths and temperatures they
   inhabit were already low (Freiwald et al., 2004). Experimental studies
   reveal that short-term exposures of important deep-water corals such as
   L. pertusa to a reduction in pH of around 0.15–0.3 units resulted in a
   decrease in calcification rates of between 30 and 56% (Maier et al.,
   2009). However, subsequent work has shown that L. pertusa can
   acclimatize (i.e., maintain considerable calcification) to declining
   aragonite levels modifying skeletal structure and skeletal strength
   (Form and Riebesell, 2012; Hennige et al., 2015). Observations of
   deep-sea corals in under-saturated waters from the SW Pacific also
   suggest some species-specific tolerance, however growth rates are
   extremely low and in under-saturated conditions dead coral skeletons
   dissolve rapidly (Bostock et al., 2015; Thresher et al., 2015). Whether
   cold-water corals will be able to adjust to rapid warming and ocean
   acidification projected for the coming century is unknown. However,
   analyses of cold-water coral fossils suggest that a combination of
   declining aragonite and oxygen saturations will reduce the distribution
   of cold-water corals (Thiagarajan et al., 2013).

   While coral species and their symbionts have received a major amount of
   focus in terms of the effect of ocean warming and acidification on
   warm-water coral reef ecosystems, there is a growing number of studies
   that have revealed impacts on a broader range of reef organisms. Among
   the most affected are calcifying algae, calcareous phytoplankton,
   molluscs, and echinoderms, with the larval stages of some organisms
   being more sensitive than the adult phase (Kroeker et al., 2013).
   Bioeroding organisms also respond to both warmer and more acidic
   conditions (Dove et al., 2013; Fang et al., 2013; Reyes-Nivia et al.,
   2013). The sponge, Cliona orientalis, increased biomass and bioerosion
   capability when exposed to warmer and more acidic conditions,
   implicating a role of this sponge in helping tip the carbonate balance
   of reefs toward net erosion (Dove et al., 2013; Fang et al., 2013).
   Similar observations have been made for bio-eroding endolithic algal
   communities, where small shifts in ocean temperature and acidity (i.e.,
   CO[2] levels) enhanced skeletal dissolution and was associated with
   increased endolithic biomass and respiration under elevated
   temperatures and CO[2] levels (Reyes-Nivia et al., 2013).

   In addition to impacts on growth, calcification, and reproduction,
   there is growing evidence of impacts on a range of physiological
   systems of coral reef organisms. Ocean acidification, for example,
   impairs the homing ability and olfactory discrimination of some coral
   reef fish, with potential consequences for the ability of fish to
   detect and avoid predators (Munday et al., 2009; Dixson et al., 2010).
   At present, there are few reports on the influence or not of ocean
   acidification on the metabolic performance of tropical fish species. In
   this regard, it will be important to explore whether or not tropical
   fish have the same challenges that temperate fish have when it comes to
   respiratory gas transport and acid–base balance (Esbaugh et al., 2012;
   Pörtner et al., 2014). Physiological impacts combined with ecological
   impacts and habitat degradation, are likely to generate “surprises” for
   complex ecosystems such as those associated with both cold and warm
   water coral reefs.

Ecological Ramifications of Rapid Change

   The impact of climate change on coral reef organisms has ramifications
   for ecosystems, some of which may be transformative in terms of their
   effects on primary productivity, food web dynamics, habitat forming
   species, disease ecology, and many other aspects (Hoegh-Guldberg and
   Bruno, 2010). The recent decline in the abundance of warm-water coral
   reefs (Hughes, 1994; Gardner et al., 2003; Bruno and Selig, 2007;
   De'ath et al., 2012), however, illustrates the complex yet fundamental
   ways that marine ecosystems are changing in response to rapid rates of
   ocean warming and acidification. The ecological ramifications of rapid
   global change for mesophotic coral reefs are less well-known or
   understood than those of warm-water shallow reef systems. Similarly,
   threats to cold-water coral reefs less well-understood and undoubtedly
   involve a different mix of local and global drivers (Turley et al.,
   2007; Roberts and Cairns, 2014).

   The major ecological responses of warm-water coral reefs to climate
   change have their origins in the response of reef-building corals to
   warming and acidification, and their role as framework builders within
   typical carbon reef systems (Gattuso et al., 1998; Kleypas et al.,
   1999a; Reynaud et al., 2003; Maier et al., 2009; Kroeker et al., 2013).
   As described above, corals are sensitive to small changes in
   temperature, light, and a number of other environmental variables,
   responding by disassociating from the dinoflagellate symbionts that
   populate their tissues (i.e., bleaching). Small changes in temperature
   are driving decreased growth and reproduction and increased mortality
   of corals in many parts of the world (Hoegh-Guldberg and Smith, 1989;
   Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014). As corals lose
   their symbionts, they become vulnerable to death and disease, as well
   as being less able to compete with other benthic organisms. These
   changes have driven episodes of coral mortality associated with thermal
   stress, with the catastrophic loss of corals in particular regions over
   the past 30 years (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Baker et al., 2008; Eakin C.
   M. et al., 2010; Glynn, 2012). While some coral reefs have recovered
   over subsequent decades many others have not. Regional differences in
   the ability to recover are linked to the presence and absence of other
   factors affecting the resilience of reef building corals and other reef
   related organisms such as levels of herbivory, macroalgal cover, and
   coral recruitment rates (Baker et al., 2008). The reduced resilience of
   reef building corals as a result of thermal stress is likely to be
   exacerbated by increasing ocean acidification, which has the potential
   to reduce the ability of corals to grow, calcify, and recover from
   disturbances. While teasing apart the effects of rising temperatures
   and increasing amounts of ocean acidification is difficult, both
   thermal stress, and acidification have the potential to reduce the
   ability of corals to recover from stresses (Hughes et al., 2007). This
   may help explain why stressors such as cyclones, which do not appear to
   have increased in frequency over the past 30 years (Callaghan and
   Power, 2011; IPCC, 2013), appear to be having longer-lasting impacts on
   coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef (De'ath et al., 2012).

   Mass coral bleaching reduces the energy available to corals, leading to
   physiological compromise. Warm-water corals, for example, exude mucus
   which is rich with the excess carbohydrates which provides food for a
   large number of molluscs, crustaceans, worms, ciliates, fish, and many
   other organisms (Baker et al., 2008; Wild et al., 2011). It also
   appears to play an important role in preventing the settlement of
   fouling and disease organisms. Mucus secretion, however, is reduced in
   bleached corals, potentially leading to increased disease (Harvell et
   al., 2007). Bleaching can also directly influence growth and
   reproduction of corals, as well is their tendency to succumb to a range
   of diseases (Harvell et al., 1999, 2007; Bruno and Selig, 2007; Baker
   et al., 2008). A reduction in reef-building corals raises the threat
   that a considerable proportion of the mega-diversity associated with
   coral reefs will face extirpation or, for some species, global
   extinction (Glynn, 2012). A meta-analysis of 17 independent studies,
   undertaken by Wilson et al. (2006), revealed that fish species reliant
   on live coral cover for food and shelter (some 62% of reef fish
   species) decreased in abundance within 3 years of disturbance events
   such bleaching, storms, and outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish that
   reduced coral cover by 10% or more.

   The loss of calcifiers such as corals and calcareous algae due to
   warming and other stressors contributes to a reduced rate of community
   calcification, which is exacerbated by increases in dissolution and
   bioerosion as the water column becomes more acidified. Coral bleaching
   events driven by elevated temperatures has also been shown to shift
   carbonate budgets of coral reefs from net accretion to net erosion
   (DeCarlo et al., 2017; Januchowski-Hartley et al., 2017). Sixteen years
   later, a third of reefs that were considered ecologically recovering
   (Graham et al., 2015) did not show positive carbon budgets
   (Januchowski-Hartley et al., 2017). Reefs remaining in negative
   carbonate budgets were those where massive coral loss was high and
   recovery of branched corals was low. The composition of reef benthic
   communities, which are sensitive to thermal stress, have an influence
   on the sensitivity of coral reef ecosystems to ocean acidification
   (DeCarlo et al., 2017). In long-term studies done in mesocosms,
   carbonate balance of reefs tips toward overall dissolution under
   concentrations of CO[2] of more than 450 ppm (Dove et al., 2013), which
   matches similar conclusions from previous experimental work (Anthony et
   al., 2008; Wild et al., 2011; Andersson and Gledhill, 2013) and from
   the geographical distribution of coral reefs in relation to the
   aragonite saturation state of seawater (Kleypas et al., 1999b;
   Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007).

Evidence for Evolutionary Responses and the Relocation of Ecosystems

   The strong relationship between short periods of elevated sea
   temperature in mass coral bleaching and mortality within warm-water
   coral reefs has been used to project how communities of reef building
   corals might change as ocean temperatures increase as a result of
   anthropogenic climate change (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Done et al., 2003;
   Donner et al., 2005; Frieler et al., 2012). Inherent to the conclusions
   of these studies, however, is the requirement that the thermal
   threshold of corals remain relatively constant over time. Evidence from
   the past 25 years, over which time satellite measurement programmes
   have used a simple algorithm based on sea surface temperature anomalies
   (relative to the average summer-time maxima 1985–1993) to predict when
   and where mass coral bleaching and mortality is likely to occur. This
   strongly suggests that little change has occurred in the sensitivity of
   reef building corals to thermal stress (Eakin C. et al., 2010; Strong
   et al., 2011; Hoegh-Guldberg, 2012). Nonetheless, it is important to
   consider potential evolutionary responses of reef-building corals over
   the next 100 years as well as the potential for coral reef ecosystems
   to relocate, as conditions change. Due to the dearth of information
   available about mesophotic and cold-water corals, this discussion will
   be restricted to the evidence for warm-water coral reefs.

   Other than dying, corals have the option of acclimatizing, evolving or
   relocating as conditions within a region become sub-optimal
   (Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014a). Reef -building corals, like all organisms, can
   adjust their phenotype or acclimate to match local conditions to some
   extent (Gates and Edmunds, 1999; Middlebrook et al., 2010, 2012).
   However, there is little or no evidence that acclimatization has
   resulted in an upward shift in the thermal tolerance of reef-building
   corals (Eakin C. et al., 2010; Hoegh-Guldberg, 2012; Hoegh-Guldberg et
   al., 2014). Corals appear able to shift the relative ratio of different
   genetic clades or varieties of Symbiodinium within the one coral
   colony, which is correlated with tolerance to extreme temperatures
   (Rowan et al., 1997; Berkelmans and van Oppen, 2006; Jones et al.,
   2008). Further investigation of these putatively more tolerant
   varieties reveals a physiological trade-off in terms of reduced growth
   and competitiveness (Jones and Berkelmans, 2011).

   A few studies (Glynn et al., 2001; Maynard et al., 2008a,b) have
   proposed that the thermal tolerance of reef building corals has
   increased over time, with less corals bleaching for similar amounts of
   thermal stress. The problem with these studies is several-fold
   (Hoegh-Guldberg, 2009). For example, the assessment of stress levels
   was restricted to temperature alone despite the fact that variation in
   parameters such as the light intensity (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Mumby et
   al., 2001) and water flow rates over a reef (Nakamura and Van Woesik,
   2001) can significantly modify the overall stress levels arising from
   elevated temperature at small scales (Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014a). As well,
   studies like that of Maynard et al. (2008a) investigated community
   level responses, and hence are unable to distinguish the loss of
   fragile species as opposed to the specific acclimatization and/or
   adaptation of individual species. Evidence for acclimatization in other
   reef organisms has exposed some intriguing possibilities, such as
   transgenerational acclimatization, where organisms inherit improved
   tolerances from parents that have been previously exposed to high
   levels of stress. For example, some coral reef fishes being exposed to
   higher CO[2] levels prior to producing the next generation (Donelson et
   al., 2012; Miller et al., 2012). Whether or not this mechanism operates
   within corals is unknown, although the very observation that the same
   satellite temperature threshold still works after more than 25 years is
   evidence that thresholds are not changing very rapidly. As observed by
   Donner et al. (2005), the required rate of adaptation needs to match
   the rate of increase in sea temperatures or ~0.1–0.2°C per decade.

   Genetic adaptation has also been suggested as a mechanism by which
   coral populations might be able to keep up with rapid changes in ocean
   temperature. Like all organisms, corals and their symbionts have
   adapted to local temperature conditions, a fact embodied by the fact
   that thresholds used by satellites for predicting mass coral bleaching
   and mortality are tied closely to local temperature conditions (Strong
   et al., 2011). Adapting to local conditions, however, has probably
   taken hundreds if not thousands of years and is slowed by the fact that
   reef building corals have generation times from 5 to over 100 years
   (Babcock, 1991). As a result, reef building corals do not have the
   population characteristics that would favor rates of evolution that
   would enable them to keep up with an environment that is changing
   faster than any time in the past 65 million years if not 300 million
   years (Hönisch et al., 2012). Several researchers have suggested that
   corals might “evolve” by swapping their symbionts for more thermally
   adapted varieties (Buddemeier and Fautin, 1993). Evidence of this,
   however, has not eventuated. These propositions also suffer from the
   problem that both the coral and the symbiont need to adapt to
   temperature change (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2002; Stat et al., 2006,
   2009; Hoegh-Guldberg, 2012, 2014a). There are several observations of
   the shuffling of strains of Symbiodinium within the one host in
   response to warming (Rowan et al., 1997). These changes, however, are
   examples of acclimatization as opposed to genetic adaptation
   (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2002). In this regard, the advent of completely
   new symbiotic association between coral and a novel strain of
   Symbiodinium, hence a “new symbiotic genotype” has never been observed.

   A third and final response by organisms facing rapidly changing
   conditions might be to relocate to new areas, which has been documented
   for a large number of marine plants and animals (Poloczanska et al.,
   2013, 2014). New records of several coral reef species have been
   reported at high latitude locations (Precht and Aronson, 2004; Yamano
   et al., 2011) which is consistent with the proposition that corals
   might shift to higher latitudes. There is also ample evidence that
   small increases in ocean temperature in the past have resulted in the
   appearance of coral reefs at slightly higher latitudes than where they
   are found today (Precht and Aronson, 2004; Greenstein and Pandolfi,
   2008). While these reports are interesting, they are not sufficient to
   support the notion that whole coral reef ecosystems will shift
   successfully to higher latitudes as anthropogenic warming of the ocean
   continues which raises some important considerations. Firstly, how will
   ecosystem structure and function of coral reefs be affected if only a
   portion of species in the ecosystem shift, and which of these are the
   critical components for ecosystem services. Secondly, reduced light
   levels along with decreasing aragonite saturation are also critical
   factors in determining whether or not carbonate coral reef ecosystems
   will form successfully at higher latitudes. As recognized by Greenstein
   and Pandolfi (2008), other factors (e.g., available shallow water shelf
   habitats) are crucially important for determining whether or not coral
   reef ecosystems will be able to move to higher latitudes. Thirdly,
   analogies to past shifts are limited given that current changes on
   coral reefs today include a multitude of other pressures in addition to
   temperature (e.g., pollution, ocean acidification). And finally, shifts
   in the past occurred over long periods of time during which conditions
   were relatively stable as compared to the extremely rapid changes
   typical of today. Current changes in ocean temperature and acidity will
   continue for centuries, if not millennia, under the current greenhouse
   gas emission pathway, thereby severely limiting the ability of
   populations and adaptive processes to keep up with a rapidly changing
   climate (Hoegh-Guldberg, 2012).

Global Change: Projected Responses to Rapid Ocean Warming and Acidification

   The close relationship between mass coral bleaching and mortality, and
   short periods of elevated sea temperature, provides an opportunity to
   explore how warm-water coral reefs are likely to be affected under
   different climate change scenarios (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999). Using
   projections of sea surface temperature (SST), future temperatures could
   be compared to established thermal thresholds for corals, and the
   frequency and intensity of future mass coral bleaching and estimated
   mortality. This led to the conclusion, which was somewhat controversial
   at the time, that coral reefs would experience mass coral bleaching and
   mortality on a yearly basis as early as 2030–2040. With field
   observations concluding that recovery from disturbances such as mass
   coral bleaching and mortality takes at least 10–20 years, the
   predictions of yearly mass coral bleaching and mortality events suggest
   strongly that coral dominated ecosystems would be unable to cope, and
   would start to disappear around this time. Subsequent studies revealed
   that these conclusions are not far-fetched and matched the expectations
   of a thermal threshold of corals was relatively fixed, as it appears to
   be (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Done et al., 2003; Donner et al., 2005; Eakin
   C. et al., 2010; Eakin C. M. et al., 2010; Frieler et al., 2012).

   Hoegh-Guldberg et al. (2014) repeated the analysis of Hoegh-Guldberg
   (1999) using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) data
   from an ensemble of 10–16 independent models. Historical and unforced
   temperature trends were compared with those from Representative
   Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 (global temperature “about as likely as
   not” to exceed 1.5°C by 2100 relative to 1986–2005) and RCP 8.5 (global
   temperature “very likely” to exceed 3.0°C by 2100 relative to
   1986–2005) in terms of model projections of the future for coral reef
   provinces. Model outputs were constrained to geographic areas (coral
   regions) known to contain warm-water coral reefs. The range in each
   case represents differences between models and model assumptions. Three
   things become apparent. First, the amount of SST warming that we have
   seen so far is very significant in each coral region given that average
   global temperature has warmed by 0.85°C over the period 1880–2012
   (Table 1, Figure 6). Second, differences between the two RCP scenarios
   do not become evident until mid to late century (Table 2, Figure 6).
   Third, only conditions associated with the RCP 2.6 scenario stabilize,
   which is important if evolutionary processes are to be able to operate
   and re-establish coral reef ecosystems in these regions. In the context
   of the preceding discussion, this is the only scenario in which coral
   reefs have any chance of replenishing tropical coastal regions.

   1.1 (HADISST1.1) data set (Rayner et al., 2003) reconstructed
   historical SST dataset. Shading denotes the 5–95 percentile range of
   climate model simulations driven with “historical”changes in
   anthropogenic and natural drivers (62 simulations), historical changes
   in “natural” drivers only (25), the RCP4.5 emissions scenario (62), and
   the RCP8.5 (62). Data are anomalies from the 1986 to 2006 average of
   the HADISST1-1 data (for the HadISST1.q time series) or of the
   corresponding historical all-forcing simulations. Figure SM30-3 with
   the permission of IPCC AR5 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014).

   Hoegh-Guldberg et al. (2014) also looked at the annual incidence of
   bleaching and mortality events. The proportion of a coral grid cells
   with a reef province (Figures 1B, 7A) that would have a particular
   stress level in any 1 year was calculated and the maximum for each
   decade then plotted. Two levels of stress were examined. The first
   being the amount of warming required to trigger mass bleaching, which
   is around one Degree Heating Months (DHM) (Strong et al., 2011) and is
   shown in Figure 7B. The second was the amount of heat stress required
   to trigger mass mortality events like those that occurred in the
   Maldives, Okinawa, North-West Australia and Palau in 1998, and is
   calculated as five Degree Heating Months Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Figure
   7C). The conclusions from this analysis are very clear. Firstly, the
   risk of mass coral bleaching (DHM ≥ 1) increases steadily over the next
   few decades, affecting all regions of the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and
   eastern Pacific. By contrast, the Western Pacific Ocean, Coral
   Triangle, and Indian Ocean are likely to experience less stress and
   will still have large areas unaffected by annual mass coral bleaching
   by the end of the century. Secondly, conditions that drive mass
   mortality events today (DHM > 5) will spread across most regions by the
   end of the century under RCP 8.5. This risk decreases from RCP 8.5 to
   zero under RCP 2.6 with no regions experiencing annual conditions that
   would cause mass mortality event. Given the time that it takes for
   coral reefs to recover from mass mortality events (10–20 years), there
   is significant risk associated with high greenhouse gas emission
   scenarios given that the damage from these events, even in managed reef
   systems. Even 10% of grid cells being at risk of experiencing a mass
   mortality event would eventually add up to a very low number of
   unaffected areas by the end of century.

   Strong et al., 1997, 2011) and (C) DHM ≥5 (associated with bleaching
   followed by significant mortality; Eakin C. M. et al., 2010) for the
   period 1870–2009 using the Hadley Centre Interpolated sea surface
   temperature 1.1 (HadISST1.1) data set. The black line on each graph is
   the maximum annual area value for each decade over the period
   1870–2009. This value is continued through 2010–2099 using Coupled
   Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) data and splits into the
   four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5).
   DHM were produced for each of the four RCPs using the ensembles of CMIP
   models. From these global maps of DHM, the annual percentage of grid
   cells with DHM ≥1 and DHM ≥5 were calculated for each coral region.
   These data were then grouped into decades from which the maximum annual
   proportions were derived. The plotted lines for 2010–2099 are the
   average of these maximum proportion values for each RCP. Monthly sea
   surface temperature anomalies were derived using a 1985–2000 maximum
   monthly mean climatology derived in the calculations for Figure 30-4 in
   Hoegh-Guldberg et al. (2014). This was done separately for HadISST1.1,
   the CMIP5 models, and each of the four RCPs, at each grid cell for
   every region. DHMs were then derived by adding up the monthly anomalies
   using a 4-month rolling sum. Figure SM30-3 presents past and future sea
   temperatures for the six major coral reef provinces under historic,
   un-forced (no anthropogenic forcing), RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios.

   Considering cold-water coral ecosystems, at pre-industrial atmospheric
   CO[2] level, 9% of known cold-water coral ecosystems were in
   under-saturated water (Cao et al., 2014). Under emission scenario IS92a
   (atmospheric CO[2] concentration 713 ppm and temperature increase of
   about 2.4°C by 2100), an estimated 70% of cold-water corals could be in
   under-saturated water by the end of the century with some ecosystems
   experiencing under-saturation by 2020s (Guinotte et al., 2006; Turley
   et al., 2007). Even if mitigation efforts (e.g., through
   geoengineering) could reduce atmospheric CO[2] levels to pre-industrial
   by the end of the century, the lag in the recovery of deep ocean
   chemistry would result in longer-lasting threats to cold-water coral
   ecosystems (Cao et al., 2014).

Living with Change: Implications for People and Livelihoods

   Overall, the evidence presented above confirms earlier work
   (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Done et al., 2003; Donner et al., 2005; Frieler
   et al., 2012) and substantiates the serious concern regarding the
   vulnerability of carbonate coral reef systems to a rapidly changing
   world. Given the importance of coastal ecosystems such as warm-water
   coral reefs for hundreds of millions of humans (Burke et al., 2011;
   Hoegh-Guldberg, 2015), these changes are likely to have implications
   for people and livelihoods, as well as regional security in some
   instances. It is also clear that we must increase our understanding of
   the effects of warming and acidifying oceans on mesophotic and
   cold-water coral reefs. These coral reefs represent important stores of
   biodiversity as well as habitat for fish, many of which are
   commercially important. As the deep ocean warms, the aragonite
   saturation horizon shoals and dissolved oxygen declines, it will be
   important to understand how these ecosystems will be affected. It will
   also be important to get a better understanding of how environmental
   conditions differ in the case of mesophotic reefs and whether or not
   they have the potential to act as refugia for coral reef species from
   the greater environmental extremes of shallow regions (Bongaerts et
   al., 2010a, 2013, 2015).

   With regard to cold-water corals, management interventions are likely
   to be limited to regulating or banning fishing and mineral extraction
   in the locality of reefs (Thresher et al., 2011). The highest priority
   for these sensitive ecosystems is to locate and protect sites that are
   likely to be refugia areas (Thresher et al., 2015).

   The recent consensus of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
   (IPCC, 2014) identified a number of risks and vulnerabilities for coral
   reefs under rapid ocean warming and acidification, as well as exploring
   the ramifications and adaptation options (see Table 30.4 in
   Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014). Changes to the structure of ecosystems
   such as a loss of coral reefs, underpin a series of risks and
   vulnerabilities to fisheries production and consequently food and
   income security in tropical regions thus rates of unemployment and
   poverty. As coral reef ecosystems degrade or disappear, there is the
   risk that coastal fisheries production is reduced, decreasing food
   security and increasing unemployment. There is also a risk that the
   tourist appeal of tropical coastal assets may decrease as ecosystems
   take on less desirable states (i.e., from coral to seaweed domination),
   affecting the potential to attract tourist dollars. Reduced
   availability to food and income is likely to exacerbate coastal poverty
   in many equatorial countries. Strategies to reduce risks in both these
   cases involve strengthening integrated coastal zone management to
   reduce contributing stresses such as coastal pollution,
   overexploitation and physical damage to coastal resources.

   As outlined by Poloczanska et al. (2013, 2014, 2016), marine species
   are already redistributing toward higher latitudes. This has the
   potential to reorganize ecosystems including commercial fish stocks,
   drive changes to the distribution, and abundance of predators and prey,
   as well as increasing the risks of invasive species taking hold in new
   locations and ecosystems. Changes to the distribution of fish species
   in coral reef regions are expected as oceans warm (Cheung et al., 2010;
   Pörtner et al., 2014; García Molinos et al., 2015). This has the
   potential to change national income in either direction, depending on
   location, as important fisheries stocks redistribute, increasing the
   likelihood of disputes over national ownership of fisheries resources
   (Robinson J. et al., 2010). In this regard, key management actions to
   reduce risks include increased international cooperation over key
   fisheries as well as developing a better understanding of the linkages
   between ocean productivity, recruitment and fisheries stock levels
   (Bell et al., 2011). International cooperation on measures which enable
   sustainable fishing of these valuable stocks that take into account the
   influence of climate change across international boundaries, are
   important adaptation measures that need to be implemented as soon as
   possible (Robinson J. et al., 2010). Changing ecosystem structures in a
   warming and acidifying ocean is also likely to increase the risk of
   disease such as ciguatera and harmful algal blooms, with ramifications
   for human health and well-being. Strategies in this case involve
   increased monitoring and education surrounding key risks, plus the
   development of alternative fisheries and income for periods in which
   disease incident increases (Bell et al., 2013).

Conclusion: The Key Role of Climate Stabilization and Non-Climate Change
Factors

   A recurrent theme within this review is the fact that we are already
   seeing major and fundamental change occurring in the world's ocean in
   response to climate change and that the rate of change is largely
   outstripping the ability for coral reefs to adapt genetically or
   relocate. If greenhouse gas emissions are not mitigated, it is very
   clear that the ocean will be a vastly different place by the mid to
   late century (Gattuso et al., 2015). It is also clear that there are
   few or no adaptation strategies for humans to counter the risks of
   ocean warming and acidification at global scales. If they did exist,
   they would almost certainly be prohibitively expensive relative to the
   costs of developing solutions to the unprecedented rise of CO[2] in the
   earth's atmosphere.

   This leaves us with two clear options with respect to preserving
   invaluable ecosystems such as coral reefs. The first is to stabilize
   planetary temperature and CO[2] concentrations as quickly as possible.
   Only then will biological responses such as acclimation and genetic
   adaptation have any chance of operating. The second is to dramatically
   reduce local stresses which are currently acting on coral reefs and
   which are reducing their resilience to climate change. By reducing
   these non-climate stresses, coral reefs will have the opportunity to
   develop greater robustness or resilience to the challenges of a
   changing planet. However, if this is not combined with stabilization of
   temperatures and acidification then it is likely to only temporarily
   put off the inevitable. If we do these two things, there is a chance
   that conditions will stabilize on planet earth by mid-to-late century,
   ensuring that some of the spectacular coral reef ecosystems will be
   able to flourish across the world's tropical regions.

Climate Impacts of Cultured Meat and Beef Cattle

   [24] John Lynch^* and [newprofile_default_profileimage_new.jpg] Raymond
   Pierrehumbert

       University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom

   Improved greenhouse gas (GHG) emission efficiency of production has
   been proposed as one of the biggest potential advantages of cultured
   meat over conventional livestock production systems. Comparisons with
   beef are typically highlighted, as it is a highly emissions intensive
   food product. In this study, we present a more rigorous comparison of
   the potential climate impacts of cultured meat and cattle production
   than has previously been made. Warming impacts are evaluated using a
   simple climate model that simulates the different behaviors of carbon
   dioxide (CO[2]), methane (CH[4]), and nitrous oxide (N[2]O), rather
   than relying on carbon dioxide equivalent (CO[2]e) metrics. We compare
   the temperature impact of beef cattle and cultured meat production at
   all times to 1,000 years in the future, using four synthetic meat GHG
   footprints currently available in the literature and three different
   beef production systems studied in an earlier climate modeling paper.
   Cattle systems are associated with the production of all three GHGs
   above, including significant emissions of CH[4], while cultured meat
   emissions are almost entirely CO[2] from energy generation. Under
   continuous high global consumption, cultured meat results in less
   warming than cattle initially, but this gap narrows in the long term
   and in some cases cattle production causes far less warming, as CH[4]
   emissions do not accumulate, unlike CO[2]. We then model a decline in
   meat consumption to more sustainable levels following high consumption,
   and show that although cattle systems generally result in greater peak
   warming than cultured meat, the warming effect declines and stabilizes
   under the new emission rates of cattle systems, while the CO[2] based
   warming from cultured meat persists and accumulates even under reduced
   consumption, again overtaking cattle production in some scenarios. We
   conclude that cultured meat is not prima facie climatically superior to
   cattle; its relative impact instead depends on the availability of
   decarbonized energy generation and the specific production systems that
   are realized.

Introduction

   Cultured meat is an emerging technology in which animal muscle cells
   are produced through tissue culture in a controlled factory or
   laboratory environment, in contrast to traditional whole-animal
   livestock systems (Stephens et al., 2018). Other commonly used terms
   include clean, in vitro, lab-grown, or synthetic meat. Reducing the
   environmental impacts of meat production, and particularly greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions, is generally highlighted as a significant
   potential advantage of cultured meat (Tuomisto and Teixeira de Mattos,
   2011; Post, 2012). Despite recent research and popular interest in
   cultured meat, and the frequency with which its supposed climate
   benefits are reported, the potential temperature impacts of cultured
   meat production have not yet been investigated.

   Livestock production systems are associated with a number of GHG
   emissions, and have made a significant contribution to anthropogenic
   climate change (Reisinger and Clark, 2018). Broadly, the livestock
   themselves result in emissions of methane (CH[4]) and nitrous oxide
   (N[2]O) from their manures, and further methane from enteric
   fermentation in ruminants. Further GHGs associated with, but not
   directly emitted by, animal production include the loss of nitrous
   oxide from fertilizer application to grow their feed, carbon dioxide
   (CO[2]) emissions from the conversion of land for pasture or feed
   production, and CO[2] emissions resulting from fossil fuel based energy
   generation, for example in tractor fuels or the manufacture of
   fertilizers (in addition to by-product CO[2] also formed in fertilizer
   production, Dawson and Hilton, 2011). While there is a very large range
   in emissions associated with different animal production systems, they
   are generally shown to emit significantly more per unit of food output
   (for example emissions per kg final product or per kg protein) than
   plant-based systems, and beef is typically highlighted as among the
   most emission intensive food products (Clune et al., 2017; Poore and
   Nemecek, 2018).

   Proponents of cultured meat have suggested that bypassing the wider
   biological processes of the whole animal can result in lower emissions
   per unit of meat produced, as the direct animal emissions are avoided,
   and cultured systems could be designed to more efficiently convert
   inputs into the desired output (meat), thus minimizing the emissions
   associated with the production of these inputs. A trade-off may exist
   in significant energy demand to maintain the controlled manufacturing
   environment that essentially replaces some of the animal's biological
   functions (Mattick et al., 2015b); and large uncertainties remain in
   what viable, animal-free, growth media may look like (Stephens et al.,
   2018) and hence their potential resource demand.

   Despite the remaining unknowns in large-scale cultured meat production,
   a small number of studies have undertaken speculative life cycle
   assessments (LCA) to predict the environmental footprint of cultured
   meat (Tuomisto and Teixeira de Mattos, 2011; Tuomisto et al., 2014;
   Mattick et al., 2015b; Smetana et al., 2015). The suggested GHG
   emissions per unit of cultured meat produced (“carbon footprints”) vary
   significantly, as they are based on different production systems and
   assumed inputs, and take alternative approaches in anticipating future
   developments. Nonetheless, the GHG emissions per unit of cultured meat
   are uniformly shown as superior to that of beef where this comparison
   is made (trends are less clear for other animal products).

   To date, these comparisons (and most others evaluating the relative
   emissions intensity of different products or activities) are based on
   carbon dioxide equivalent (CO[2]e) metrics that relate the emissions of
   different GHGs to carbon dioxide. However, such metrics may be
   misleading, and provide a poor indication of actual temperature
   response (Pierrehumbert, 2014). Individual gases differ both in the
   amount they change the atmospheric energy balance (radiative forcing),
   and hence lead to warming, and how long they persist in the atmosphere.
   Per molecule, methane results in significantly greater radiative
   forcing than carbon dioxide, but has an atmospheric lifespan of only
   around 12 years (Myhre et al., 2013) in contrast to the millennial
   persistence of carbon dioxide (Archer and Brovkin, 2008). Nitrous oxide
   has a much greater radiative forcing per molecule than both methane and
   carbon dioxide, and an atmospheric lifetime of just over 100 years
   (Myhre et al., 2013). The most commonly used carbon dioxide equivalence
   metric, the 100-years Global Warming Potential (GWP[100]), equates each
   gas by integrating the amount of radiative forcing that a one-off
   emissions pulse would exert over a 100-years period (Myhre et al.,
   2013). If we are to consider the climate effects of ongoing production,
   however, we need to consider the impact of continued emissions rates of
   each gas. GWP[100] based comparisons, among other limitations, do not
   sufficiently capture the temporal behavior of different gases, and in
   particular fail to express the cumulative nature of continued carbon
   dioxide emissions, and hence can relatively overstate the warming
   impact of methane (Pierrehumbert, 2014). Additionally, due to the short
   lifetime of methane, any warming it causes is largely undone shortly
   after emissions are removed, in contrast to carbon dioxide. Inferring
   relative temperature impacts from GWP[100] footprints can therefore be
   especially problematic where short-lived gases such as methane
   constitute a significant proportion of emissions, as is the case for
   beef production.

   This paper presents the first attempt to compare the potential climate
   impacts of cultured meat and beef cattle production using an
   atmospheric modeling approach, rather than relying on carbon dioxide
   equivalent comparisons. We test a number of cultured meat and beef
   system emissions footprints under three alternative consumption
   pathways, comparing the temperature impacts under different production
   and consumption scenarios at all timescales to 1,000 years.

Methods

   In order to ensure standardization, the atmospheric models, consumption
   pathways, and representative cattle production emissions all follow
   Pierrehumbert and Eshel (2015).

   A literature review was undertaken in April 2018 to screen for cultured
   meat emissions footprints. As considerable uncertainty remains over
   what real, large-scale cultured meat production may look like, four
   different footprints found in this literature review were used to
   illustrate some of the possibilities.

   The first cultured meat LCA study, presented in Tuomisto and Teixeira
   de Mattos (2011), hypothesized a system in which animal embryonic stem
   cells are grown in a cylindrical stirred tank bioreactor in a medium of
   cyanobacteria hydrolysate (as the main “feed” input), vitamins and
   animal growth factors. Animal growth factors are produced from
   genetically engineered Escherichia coli, and both growth factors and
   vitamins are considered to be required in negligible volumes, and hence
   incur negligible environmental impacts (including GHG emissions). The
   cyanobacteria production is assumed to take place in an open pond, with
   some synthetic nitrogen use considered in the default case, but either
   nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria or “nutrient-rich wastewater” used to
   eliminate the need for fertilizer inputs in the most optimistic
   scenarios. Greenhouse gas emissions result primarily from energy use
   and transport in growing and moving the cyanobacteria to the site of
   cultured meat production, followed by energy use in cyanobacteria
   processing and stirring the cell culture tank for 60 days. Residual
   heat following cyanobacteria hydrolysate sterilization initially warms
   the culture medium, and following this it is assumed heat generated by
   the metabolism of cells growing in the culture negates the need for
   external heating. Greenhouse gas footprints were then estimated based
   on the conditions and emissions per unit of energy use for three
   representative regions (Thailand, California, and Spain), with
   emissions from electricity generation lowest in Thailand and highest in
   California. The cultured meat output assumed as the functional unit was
   a “minced-beef type” product with equivalent protein content to low fat
   meat. For further details see Tuomisto and Teixeira de Mattos (2011).
   Following through the assumed yields and allocation conventions used in
   this study (see discussion below), the average emissions footprint was
   approximately 2.01 kg CO[2]e per kg cultured meat. As this study
   represents the most optimistic scenario, we use the lowest value
   presented in the sensitivity analysis of 1.69 kg CO[2]e per kg cultured
   meat, assuming no fertilizer use was necessary for cyanobacteria
   production and electricity generation uses the lowest Thai emissions
   footprint. It was not possible to separate out individual greenhouse
   gases, and so it is assumed that the entire footprint is carbon dioxide
   emissions. As there was no fertilizer use in the footprint used, and in
   alternative footprints below other emissions represent relatively small
   proportions of the total footprint, this assumption is unlikely to
   significantly affect the results.

   The second cultured meat footprint used in this study was obtained from
   Tuomisto et al. (2014). The hypothesized systems are largely as
   described above from Tuomisto and Teixeira de Mattos (2011), but with
   some refinements made to the assumed operation of the bioreactor, and a
   number of plant-based alternative feedstocks considered in addition to
   cyanobacteria. Wheat or maize feedstocks were assumed to have been
   grown with the GHG footprints of typical UK production from Williams et
   al. (2006) and sterilized and hydrolyzed as described above for
   cyanobacteria. A hollow capillary bioreactor was selected to represent
   a superior option to the stirred cylinder design above, but in this
   case also included an energy input in maintaining growth temperature
   (37°C) for cultured cells. As this study still represents an optimistic
   but potentially more realistic footprint than suggested by Tuomisto and
   Teixeira de Mattos (2011), an intermediate value of 3.67 kg CO[2]e per
   kg cultured meat was selected from the range of results presented,
   assuming maize feedstock (with a greater production footprint than
   cyanobacteria but less than wheat), and an average of the best- and
   worst-case bioreactor yield scenarios. This footprint is also assumed
   to be composed entirely of carbon dioxide emissions. In practice,
   nitrous oxide emissions would also be expected from a proportion of the
   nitrogen inputs in growing maize, but it was not possible to separate
   out this component of emissions. The omission is again considered
   unlikely to significantly influence conclusions, as discussed below in
   the context of results for other cultured meat systems.

   The remaining two cultured meat footprints were both taken from Mattick
   et al. (2015b). In this study, a two-step culturing process is assumed:
   after 5 days of proliferation of muscle stem cells, the bioreactor is
   drained and filled with a different medium for 72 h of cell
   differentiation and mass gain. It is assumed that the main constituents
   of the culture media are peptides and amino acids from soy hydrolysis,
   glucose from corn starch, and again a negligible volume of growth
   factors. In contrast to the more speculative approach of the two papers
   above, this study bases its assumptions on the metabolic requirements
   and yields of cultured meat on data from Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO)
   cell proliferation (Sung et al., 2004), as a previously tested analog
   for cell culture conditions. Corn starch microcarrier beads provide a
   scaffold around which cells proliferate, and the process is assumed to
   take place within stirred-tank bioreactors. Energy is required for
   aeration, mixing and temperature regulation during the culture phase.
   Finally, the bioreactors are cleaned between each culture batch by
   rinsing with sodium hydroxide and heating to 77.5°C. See Mattick et al.
   (2015b) for further details. As more optimistic estimates were already
   demonstrated in the two papers above, the average cultured meat
   footprint was used rather than the low end of the sensitivity analysis.
   This GHG footprint was 6.64 kg CO[2], 0.019 CH[4], and 0.0013 kg N[2]O,
   giving a total GWP[100] footprint of 7.5 kg CO[2]e per kg cultured meat
   (disaggregated emissions from Carolyn Mattick, pers. comm.).

   To represent the upper end of proposed emissions footprints for
   cultured meat production, the result from the high end of the
   sensitivity analysis in Mattick et al. (2015b) was also used. Here,
   lower cell densities are achieved at the end of the proliferation
   phase, no further biomass growth is achieved in the differentiation
   phase, and the biomanufacturing facility building size and energy
   footprint are treated as comparable to a pharmaceutical plant, rather
   than a brewery as in the default scenario. This resulted in a footprint
   of 25 kg CO[2]e per kg cultured meat. It was not possible to extract
   the individual gas composition from the sensitivity analysis, but for
   this study we assume that the gases constitute the same proportions as
   in the baseline case, resulting in 22.1 kg CO[2], 0.062 CH[4], and
   0.0043 kg N[2]O per kg cultured meat.

   A further emissions footprint for cultured meat is also provided by
   Smetana et al. (2015), but as some details regarding the functional
   unit, system boundaries and production methods assumed in this study
   were unclear, and the carbon dioxide equivalent footprint presented was
   similar to the result at the high end of the sensitivity analysis in
   Mattick et al. (2015b), it was not used in this study.

   Three representative beef footprints were used following Pierrehumbert
   and Eshel (2015) to illustrate some of the variation in quantity and
   composition of emissions associated with contemporary beef production
   systems (Table 1). The lowest footprint for all gases is demonstrated
   by production at an organic Swedish ranch from Cederberg and Nillson
   (2004). This is an extensive, low-input (no pesticides or synthetic
   fertilizers, but organic pig manure imported) system that achieves
   birth rates of approximately one animal a year and fast weight gain,
   hence low methane emissions per output. An alternative footprint
   composition is shown in the Brazilian pasture system from Cederberg et
   al. (2009), which is also an extensive, low-input system, but methane
   emissions per unit beef produced are significantly greater due to
   slower animal weight gain. CO[2] emissions from production are likely
   actually lower than in the Swedish case (rather than equal, as shown in
   the table) as this footprint includes emissions resulting transport
   from Brazil to Europe; however, these are more than offset by likely
   emissions resulting from deforestation, which are not included here but
   returned to in the discussion. Finally, the highest beef footprint
   included is a pasture system in the Midwestern USA from Pelletier et
   al. (2010). This system also achieves relatively fast animal weight
   gain, and so methane emissions are equivalent to the Swedish system,
   but this is achieved through an energy and input intensive management
   that results in high carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions. For
   further details see Pierrehumbert and Eshel (2015) and the original
   studies referenced. Two further footprints demonstrating emissions from
   a Midwestern USA feedlot and the average for Swedish beef production
   included in Pierrehumbert and Eshel (2015) were omitted from this study
   for clarity, as they provided intermediate emission profiles that were
   similar to those described above.
   TABLE 1
   www.frontiersin.org

   Table 1. Emissions profiles of cultured meat and beef cattle
   production, expressed as individual gases and total IPCC 5th Assessment
   Report 100-Years Global Warming Potential carbon dioxide equivalent
   (GWP[100] CO[2]e) per kg of meat output (either cultured meat or bone
   free beef).

   As these beef footprints are not completely harmonized (e.g., the
   emissions incurred in the transport of Brazilian beef to Europe noted
   above), the emissions described for each system may represent
   methodological differences between studies, such as different system
   boundaries, co-product allocations and LCA databases, rather than
   differences between the beef production systems themselves. Comparing
   individual LCA studies can be problematic, even for the same product
   (de Vries et al., 2015), and there are significant challenges in
   standardizing agricultural LCAs (Adewale et al., 2018). For the
   purposes of this study, these footprints provide contrasting
   case-studies with a different balance of GHG emissions to illustrate
   the distinct climate impacts of each gas, but should not necessarily be
   taken as globally representative or definitive, standardized beef LCAs.

   Emissions footprints for every system are shown in Table 1. It should
   be noted that all cultured meat carbon dioxide equivalent footprint
   estimates, including the high end of the sensitivity analysis, are
   lower than those of every cattle system in this study.

Consumption Pathways

   Three alternative consumption pathways were used to illustrate the
   dynamics resulting from the alternative GHG footprints, with impacts
   from all systems shown for 1,000 years.

   The first scenario is based on constant, very high levels of meat
   consumption: 25 kg per capita per annum (roughly the contemporary beef
   consumption rate in the USA) for a population of 10 billion. This
   pathway is intended to explore the temperature impacts of unrestrained
   consumption and illustrate the distinct climate impacts of different
   greenhouse gases under sustained emissions. (Note that here and for all
   other scenarios, we only model aggregated global totals, and the
   consumption described is assumed to lead directly to the associated
   production (and hence emissions). We do not address issues surrounding,
   for example, food waste, access, and distribution, despite their
   importance in designing a sustainable food system (Garnett, 2013), as
   our focus is on demonstrating the relevant climatic principles).

   The second scenario assumes the same very high consumption rates for
   the first 100 years, followed by an exponential decline, i.e.,
   consumption is a function of time C(t) such that:

   where C[m] is the peak (and in this scenario, also initial) consumption
   rate, which declines after time t[m] (= 100 years) with time constant,
   τ = 50 years. This scenario illustrates the difference between
   long-term warming impacts of each gas when their emissions decline
   toward 0.

   The third scenario presents a more realistic demonstration and attempts
   to illustrate a potentially sustainable space for meat consumption.
   Meat consumption starts at a rate approximately equal to current global
   consumption (5.55 kg per capita per annum for a population of 7.3
   billion, following Pierrehumbert and Eshel, 2015), then increases
   exponentially to reach a peak consumption rate of 25 kg per capita per
   annum for a population of 10 billion after 100 years. Following this
   peak, consumption declines exponentially to a long-term annual
   consumption rate (C[∞]) equivalent to 75% of current global
   consumption. Beef consumption is therefore defined as:

Climate Modeling Approach

   Temperature responses were derived using an energy-balance climate
   modeling approach following Pierrehumbert and Eshel (2015). Annual
   emissions of each gas, as determined by the system type and consumption
   trajectories described above, are used to determine the change in
   radiative forcing and consequently warming over time.

   Carbon dioxide forcing was calculated using a function that models
   change in atmospheric concentration of CO[2], incorporating ocean
   uptake, and a logarithmic relationship between changes in CO[2]
   concentration and resultant forcing (following Pierrehumbert, 2014).
   For CH[4] and N[2]O, atmospheric concentrations were calculated
   assuming the gases persist in the atmosphere for 12 and 114 years,
   respectively, with forcing derived from these concentrations using
   linearized radiative efficiency coefficients from Forster et al.
   (2007). For CH[4] this forcing was increased by a factor of 1.45 to
   incorporate stratospheric water vapor amplification and positive ozone
   feedbacks.

   The transient energy balance climate model presented in Pierrehumbert
   (2014) was used to calculate warming resulting from these changes in
   forcing. A two-box ocean system is used whereby a shallow, mixed ocean
   layer warms rapidly (within years) in response to changes in forcing,
   but the deep ocean is warmed (through this mixed layer) on a much
   longer timescale. This two-box ocean system has the important effect of
   adding a delayed warming response, which can also result in some
   continued warming even when forcing is stable or declining (Held et
   al., 2010). An equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3 K per doubling in
   the atmospheric concentration of CO[2] and a short-term transient
   climate sensitivity 2/3 of the equilibrium sensitivity were assumed.
   All climate model outputs are provided in a Supplementary Table in
   addition to being illustrated in the results section below.

Results

   The first consumption pathway, continuous consumption at very high
   rates (Figure 1) illustrates the scale of warming that would result
   from large-scale meat production from current beef cattle or
   hypothesized cultured meat systems. This scenario also demonstrates the
   distinct climate impacts of each gas. As illustrated for the warming
   resulting from each gas in the Brazilian pasture system (Figure 1A),
   there is immediate, significant warming from CH[4], but under sustained
   emission rates this largely stops increasing after a few decades (by
   this point the atmospheric concentration of CH[4] has reached an
   equilibrium, and hence the forcing it results in remains the same, but
   there is still a slight long-term increase in warming due to the
   significant time lag for the temperature response of the deep ocean).
   This equilibrating dynamic is also observed for N[2]O, but on a scale
   of a few centuries rather than a few decades. In contrast, as a
   significant proportion of CO[2] emissions persist indefinitely, no
   equilibrium forcing is reached for this gas, and hence warming
   continues to increase for as long as emissions are sustained. These
   dynamics are illustrated very strongly by comparing cattle to a
   cultured meat production system (Figure 1B). Cultured meat emissions of
   CH[4] and N[2]O are relatively small and so do not significantly
   contribute to overall warming dynamics; instead we see a long-term
   perpetual increase in warming driven largely by the rate of on-going
   CO[2] emissions.
   FIGURE 1
   www.frontiersin.org

   Figure 1. Warming impact for perpetual consumption at very high rates
   (250 Mt per year) for beef cattle and cultured meat production systems
   for 1,000 years. (A,B) illustrate the individual and combined warming
   impact of separate greenhouse gases for representative beef cattle (A)
   and cultured (B) systems. (C–E) show total warming impacts for all
   systems.

   The wider system comparisons provide further demonstrations of these
   dynamics. Among the beef cattle production systems (Figure 1C), the
   Mid-Western USA pasture system shows a much greater degree of long-term
   warming than the Brazilian system, despite only a marginally higher
   carbon dioxide equivalent footprint, due to the greater proportion of
   CO[2]. The Swedish ranch system compares favorably to both, as the
   CO[2]component is low and hence we see limited long-term increase in
   warming, but due to greater production efficiency than the Brazilian
   system, CH[4] (and N[2]O) emissions are also lower, and hence the
   forcing that results once atmospheric concentrations reach equilibrium
   is less. Among the cultured meat production systems (Figure 1D), the
   warming is driven largely (or entirely for “cultured-a” and “-b”) by
   CO[2] emissions, and so there is perpetually increasing warming, the
   slope of which depends on the rate of annual CO[2] emissions. Despite
   concerns over the potential omission of some CH[4] and N[2]O emissions
   in the cultured-a and -b footprints as noted above, the marginal impact
   of these gases for cultured-c, where these data were available,
   suggests that overall trends would be similar.

   Bringing all system types together (Figure 1E) we see that the two most
   optimistic cultured meat footprints, cultured-a and cultured-b, are
   sufficiently small that these systems do indeed have a lesser climate
   impact than cattle systems. These two cultured meat systems remain
   superior to even the best beef cattle production system into the very
   long term (1,000 years), although their relative advantage declines
   over time and by the end of the period modeled is significantly less
   than might be implied by comparing carbon dioxide equivalent footprints
   (cultured-a footprint = 1.69 kg CO[2]e kg^−1 meat, Swedish = 28.6; but
   by t = 1,000 the temperature impacts are +0.18 and +0.62 K,
   respectively). The most striking example of these dynamics is provided
   by cultured-d, the production scenario at the high-end of the
   sensitivity analysis in Mattick et al. (2015b). Despite having a lower
   carbon dioxide equivalent footprint that all cattle systems here,
   within 200 years of continued production the Swedish system is
   superior, and by 450 years is outperformed by even the worst cattle
   system here (despite having only 57% of its carbon dioxide equivalent
   footprint). This system is then increasingly outperformed by all of the
   cattle systems the longer that production is maintained.

   An alternative aspect of the different temporal dynamics of each gas is
   revealed by the scenarios in which production declines toward zero
   after 100 years, as shown in Figure 2. Once emissions of CH[4] and
   N[2]O cease the warming these emissions resulted in is reversed over
   timescales largely dependent on the atmospheric lifespan of each gas
   (Figure 2A). In contrast, the warming due to CO[2] is not reversible
   within the timescales modeled here, and so warming caused by CO[2]
   persists (shown more clearly in Figure 2B). As a result, while the
   warming from cattle (Figure 2C) systems declines, the warming from
   cultured meat production persists indefinitely at a fixed level based
   on the cumulative CO[2] emissions accrued up to the point at which
   production ceases (Figure 2D).

   combined warming impact of separate greenhouse gases for representative
   beef cattle (A) and cultured (B) systems. (C–E) show total warming
   impacts for all systems.

   The potentially more realistic scenario of an increase in consumption
   followed by a decline to more sustainable levels is shown in Figure 3.
   For the Brazilian beef cattle systems (Figure 3A), the warming
   resulting from CH[4] and N[2]O grows rapidly in line-with increasing
   production, but then stabilizes at a new, lower level responding to the
   new emissions rates. For CO[2], however (again shown more clearly in
   the cultured meat example, Figure 3B), the reduction in emissions rate
   slows the rate of further warming, but this is added to the warming
   caused by historical emissions, which persists. The overall
   consequences of these dynamics depend on our climate objectives. The
   cattle production systems show greater peak warming within this
   time-frame (except for the comparison between the Swedish system and
   the highest footprint cultured meat system), but as a result of the
   persistence of the large-scale CO[2] emissions in the early periods of
   production for cultured meat, any long-term benefits of this production
   are further reduced compared to cattle systems.

Discussion

   As originally stated in Pierrehumbert and Eshel (2015), the temperature
   impacts of very large levels of beef consumption, under any of the
   systems explored here, are significant and likely incompatible with our
   climate goals. Despite the bold claims and superior carbon dioxide
   equivalent footprints, however, cultured meat is not necessarily a more
   sustainable alternative. In the most optimistic cultured meat
   production footprints, emissions are competitive with cattle systems
   for CO[2] while avoiding the other gases: this is unambiguously
   superior from a climate perspective. However, the long-term advantage
   over cattle is not as dramatic as may be suggested by simple GWP[100]
   comparisons. For the most conservative cultured meat footprint used
   here, which still had a lower carbon dioxide equivalent footprint than
   any cattle system in the study, the long-term temperature impact of
   production is dramatically worse than any cattle system. Furthermore,
   as emissions from cultured meat are predominantly composed of CO[2],
   their warming legacy persists even if production declines or ceases (in
   the absence of active removal of this CO[2] from the atmosphere).
   Replacing cattle systems with cultured meat production before energy
   generation is sufficiently decarbonized and/or the more optimistic
   production footprints presented here are realized (assuming they can
   be), could risk a long-term, negative climate impact.

   In this study, beef was selected as the livestock meat to compare with
   cultured systems due to its especially high carbon dioxide equivalent
   footprint. It is striking how poorly these footprints correspond to
   long-term temperature impact, indicating the significant influence of
   the different atmospheric lifespan of each gas not adequately captured
   by the GWP[100] metric. The 100-years time-frame demonstrates the
   increasing divergence between GWP[100] footprints and warming impact,
   but the relative exaggeration of the impacts of sustained methane
   emissions is apparent well before this (any period beyond 100 years).
   GWP[100] CO[2] equivalents also fail to highlight some of the
   significant shorter-term differences between methane and CO[2], neither
   reflecting the immediate (within ~20 years) large-scale impacts of
   initially increasing methane emissions nor capturing the reversal of
   warming resulting from decreasing (or halting) emissions (which is also
   the case for nitrous oxide in the longer-term).

   As on-going emissions of short-lived gases such as methane behave so
   differently to CO[2], even over immediate, policy-relevant timescales,
   we need to consider alternative appraisals for activities where
   emissions are largely composed of methane: here, cattle production, but
   other biogenic sources such as rice production, or fossil fuel sources
   such as natural gas leakage would need to consider similar dynamics. It
   is not sufficient to make broad climate claims based on GWP[100] carbon
   dioxide equivalent footprints alone. In order to investigate these
   issues, emissions associated with an activity must be provided in a
   disaggregated form allowing the assessment of each gas, yet these data
   are not generally available at present, and we urge researchers to
   provide them in the future (Lynch, 2019).

   It has been argued that as the emissions from cultured meat are
   primarily from energy use, they may be significantly reduced in the
   future if energy generation is decoupled from emissions (Tuomisto and
   Teixeira de Mattos, 2011)—and given the long timeframe used here, large
   scale energy decarbonization will be essential well within this period
   to prevent very significant climate impacts irrespective of any
   emissions associated with food production. In the least optimistic
   cultured meat scenario here, however, the magnitude of energy required
   is such that sufficient decarbonized energy generation appears unlikely
   in the near to medium term. Assuming an energy footprint of
   approximately 360 MJ per kg cultured meat (high-end of the sensitivity
   analysis in Mattick et al., 2015b), the production of 25 kg per capita
   per annum for a global population of 10 billion would require around 90
   EJ energy per annum, 22.9% of the 393 EJ total global energy
   consumption in 2015 (International Energy Agency, 2017); hence
   unrestrained consumption would result in a significant proportion of
   global energy supply going toward growing lab-grown meat in the absence
   of low-energy production systems.

   Decarbonized energy generation would also eliminate a proportion of the
   CO[2] emissions from cattle systems, and so for this analysis we used
   footprints as presented under contemporary energy emissions
   assumptions. Additionally, the timing of a large-scale decarbonization
   of energy generation would have significant impacts on wider climate
   targets, including determining the extent of on-going methane emissions
   that are compatible with a given temperature ceiling. As cultured meat
   is an emerging technology, wider improvements in efficiency of
   production may reduce its emissions footprint in the future, in
   addition to the decarbonization of energy generation. This, too, could
   also apply to cattle systems though, employing mitigations or
   technologies or moving to more efficient systems (Rivera-Ferre et al.,
   2016).

   Indeed, it could be argued that comparing extant cattle production with
   hypothesized cultured meat systems presents a biased parallel. The
   speculative nature of all four cultured meat footprints tested here is
   borne of necessity, as to date there are no LCA of actual cultured meat
   production (at least in the public domain), despite manufacturer claims
   that a commercial launch is imminent (Stephens et al., 2018). Given the
   unknowns in this new form of production, we must be aware that impact
   assessments may change, and continue to take a systematic approach
   (Mattick et al., 2015a). There is a need for much greater transparency
   from cultured meat manufacturers, with relevant data available to
   interrogate any environmental claims.

   In addition to the broad nature of each footprint, some specific
   elements of the cultured meat LCA remain unclear due to their
   speculative nature. In the default approaches from Tuomisto and
   Teixeira de Mattos (2011), for example, a proportion of emissions
   incurred in the production of cyanobacteria are not allocated to
   cultured meat, instead presumed assigned to food supplements. The
   potential for any co-products from cultured meat production will depend
   on the systems that might be realized. They should also be handled
   similarly to any co-products from cattle production, such as leather;
   but the treatment of livestock co-products in LCAs can be complex, and
   is not well-standardized at present (Mackenzie et al., 2017).

   The nature of the functional unit—the unit of output to which emissions
   are assigned—also remains speculative in the case of cultured meat. If
   protein rather than “meat” was taken as our functional output the
   footprints would show even greater differences between studies, with
   Mattick et al. (2015b) assuming 7% protein by weight, compared to 19%
   in Tuomisto and Teixeira de Mattos (2011) and Tuomisto et al. (2014).
   Comparing impacts on a per protein (or wider nutritional) basis will be
   important as more detailed and/or real production footprints become
   available. Even with a generic meat functional unit, as used in this
   study, there may still be further differences not captured here. In
   Mattick et al. (2015b) the functional unit is 1 kg of cell biomass: any
   further processing or additional ingredients required to convert this
   biomass into an edible form or a conventional meat product analog would
   also need to be included for a full life cycle assessment comparing
   final meat products. Tuomisto and Teixeira de Mattos (2011) assumed
   their cultured meat system output is a “minced-beef type of product,”
   but may still differ from cattle beef in nutritional or sensory
   attributes, with further processing (and hence steps to consider in a
   life cycle assessment) potentially required if a complete beef analog
   is sought. The impacts of any processes to produce different meat
   products, such as steaks, may be even greater, and more complex tissue
   engineering of this type is not anticipated in the near-future
   (Stephens et al., 2018). Processing of livestock products can also be
   associated with considerable emissions (Poore and Nemecek, 2018), and
   so system boundaries must consistently include these in future work
   comparing environmental impacts of final products ready for
   consumption.

   Spared land-use has been presented as another significant advantage of
   cultured meat production (Tuomisto and Teixeira de Mattos, 2011), and
   this land could entail a further climate benefit by being used for
   carbon sequestration. This may also be a factor in improved cattle
   production however, including simply more efficient use of current
   grasslands (Godde et al., 2018). Land-use associated carbon fluxes are
   often poorly standardized in agricultural footprinting approaches
   (Adewale et al., 2018), and were excluded here. These land-use carbon
   fluxes may have significant impacts. For example, significant
   deforestation has resulted from pasture expansion, and including the
   CO[2] emissions resulting from this would greatly increase typical
   Brazilian beef footprints (Cederberg et al., 2011). At the same time,
   grassland soils contain significant quantities of organic carbon, and
   could potentially sequester even greater amounts under appropriate
   management (Conant et al., 2017). Further detail and standardization in
   land-use emissions and sequestrations is required in the future,
   including an appraisal of likely alternative land-uses following
   sparing of current agricultural land.

   Although this study is concerned with the climate impacts of meat
   production, a wider context must also be considered. A number of other
   environmental impacts are associated with beef production, such as
   water pollution and acidification (Poore and Nemecek, 2018), and
   cultured meat may provide benefits in these wider impacts; but again,
   caution should be advised until reliable LCAs are available for actual
   production systems. Conversely, we must also consider the wider
   benefits that might be provided from meat production systems, including
   associated co-products, the provision of ecosystem services, their
   socioeconomic role in rural communities, and their landscape or
   cultural value (Rodríguez-Ortega et al., 2014). It has been argued that
   cultured meat production is a potentially transformative technology,
   and so social assessments must also be made to anticipate the
   disruption (positive or negative) that may be caused (Mattick et al.,
   2015c), alongside environmental impacts such as climate change. As a
   concept, it has been suggested that cultured meat overcomes some of the
   ethical problems of livestock production (Schaefer and Savulescu,
   2014), but has also been criticized as a problematically
   techno-centric, profit-motivated approach (Metcalf, 2013). Hocquette
   (2016) questions the broad need for cultured meat, suggesting that
   there are already alternative solutions that we could employ to
   overcome problems with our food system. Finally, any climatic or wider
   benefits that may be possible through replacing livestock systems with
   cultured meat depends on how people perceive and ultimately consume
   cultured meat products (i.e., as a direct replacement or in addition to
   conventional livestock products). Early research suggests consumer
   reluctance to replace conventional with cultured meat, with public
   willingness to eat cultured meat dependent on a number of personal
   concerns and anticipated benefits (Bryant and Barnett, 2018).

Conclusions

   The scale of cattle production required for the very high levels of
   beef consumption modeled here would result in significant global
   warming, but it is not yet clear whether cultured meat production would
   provide a more climatically sustainable alternative. The climate
   impacts of cultured meat production will depend on what level of
   decarbonized energy generation can be achieved, and the specific
   environmental footprints of production. There is a need for detailed
   and transparent LCA of real cultured meat production systems. Based on
   currently available data, cultured production does not necessarily give
   license for unrestrained meat consumption.

   Coral reefs are found in a wide range of environments, where they
   provide food and habitat to a large range of organisms as well as
   providing many other ecological goods and services. Warm-water coral
   reefs, for example, occupy shallow sunlit, warm, and alkaline waters in
   order to grow and calcify at the high rates necessary to build and
   maintain their calcium carbonate structures. At deeper locations
   (40–150 m), “mesophotic” (low light) coral reefs accumulate calcium
   carbonate at much lower rates (if at all in some cases) yet remain
   important as habitat for a wide range of organisms, including those
   important for fisheries. Finally, even deeper, down to 2,000 m or more,
   the so-called “cold-water” coral reefs are found in the dark depths.
   Despite their importance, coral reefs are facing significant challenges
   from human activities including pollution, over-harvesting, physical
   destruction, and climate change. In the latter case, even lower
   greenhouse gas emission scenarios (such as Representative Concentration
   Pathway RCP 4.5) are likely drive the elimination of most warm-water
   coral reefs by 2040–2050. Cold-water corals are also threatened by
   warming temperatures and ocean acidification although evidence of the
   direct effect of climate change is less clear. Evidence that coral
   reefs can adapt at rates which are sufficient for them to keep up with
   rapid ocean warming and acidification is minimal, especially given that
   corals are long-lived and hence have slow rates of evolution.
   Conclusions that coral reefs will migrate to higher latitudes as they
   warm are equally unfounded, with the observations of tropical species
   appearing at high latitudes “necessary but not sufficient” evidence
   that entire coral reef ecosystems are shifting. On the contrary, coral
   reefs are likely to degrade rapidly over the next 20 years, presenting
   fundamental challenges for the 500 million people who derive food,
   income, coastal protection, and a range of other services from coral
   reefs. Unless rapid advances to the goals of the Paris Climate Change
   Agreement occur over the next decade, hundreds of millions of people
   are likely to face increasing amounts of poverty and social disruption,
   and, in some cases, regional insecurity.

Introduction

   Both warm- and cold-water corals secrete calcium carbonate skeletons
   that build up over time to create a three-dimensional reef matrix that
   provides habitat for thousands of fish and other species. The
   production of limestone-like calcium carbonate is high enough in many
   warm-water coral reefs to establish carbonate structures. High rates of
   calcification are sufficient to overcome significant rates of
   bioerosion and wave driven physical erosion. These structures underpin
   the framework of barrier reefs and islands, which are critically
   important to tropical coastlines. Although they occupy less than 0.1%
   of the ocean floor, tropical coral reef ecosystems provide habitat for
   at least 25% of known marine species, with many reef species still to
   be discovered (Fisher et al., 2015). The biological diversity of
   warm-water coral reefs has been estimated to include ~1–9 million
   species that live in and around coral reefs (Reaka-Kudla, 1997, Census
   of Marine Life,
   http://www.coml.org/census-coral-reef-ecosystems-creefs). In deeper
   parts of these warm-water reef systems, the tendency toward carbonate
   dominated reef structures diminishes as light levels decrease
   (Bongaerts et al., 2010a). At low light levels, erosion and dissolution
   exceed calcium carbonate production, leading to coral communities that
   may be abundant yet with little or no three-dimensional calcium
   carbonate reef framework. Extending from 40 to 150 m, these
   “mesophotic” (low light) coral reefs also provide extensive habitat,
   with the rates of discovery of species remaining very high due to these
   reefs being difficult to visit (Bongaerts et al., 2010a, 2011).
   Mesophotic reef systems probably cover a comparable area to shallow
   warm-water coral reefs (Bongaerts et al., 2010a; Slattery et al.,
   2011).

   Both shallow or deeper mesophotic coral reefs are dominated by
   scleractinian corals that form symbiosis with dinoflagellate protists
   from the genus, Symbiodinium. On the basis of this symbiosis, their
   intracellular symbionts (i.e., living within the gastrodermal or
   digestive tissues of their coral hosts) are able to photosynthesize and
   provide the host coral with a rich source of sugars, glycerol, lipids,
   and other organic compounds (Muscatine, 1990). This relationship
   enables corals to grow and calcify at high rates in the clear, warm,
   and shallow water conditions along tropical coastlines (Muscatine and
   Porter, 1977). The abundance of Scleractinian corals hosting
   Symbiodinium decreases with depth beyond 20–40 m, depending on the
   clarity of the water column. The deepest Scleractinian corals that are
   symbiotic with Symbiodinium, are found 100 m or more below the surface
   of tropical waters (Englebert et al., 2014). The productivity of this
   symbiosis is complemented by the ability of corals to capture and feed
   on waterborne particles and plankton (i.e., polytrophy). The combined
   ability to photosynthesise, as well as feed, underpins the success of
   the highly productive coral reef ecosystems that line many tropical
   coastlines. Evidence from isotope signatures within fossils reveal that
   Scleractinian corals have been symbiotic with Symbiodinium for over 230
   million years (Stanley and Fautin, 2001; Muscatine et al., 2005), most
   probably driving productive and diverse ecosystems that were not too
   different from those of today.

   Cold-water coral reefs extend to depths of 3,000 m although some
   cold-water corals can be found growing in waters as shallow as 50 m
   (e.g., Norwegian shelf). Below 200 m depth there is so little light
   that photosynthesis is no longer possible. As a result, cold-water
   corals do not form a symbiosis with Symbiodinium and depend instead on
   particle feeding. Discoveries of the locations and extent of cold-water
   reefs has primarily been driven by advances in underwater technologies
   for surveying and mapping (Turley et al., 2007; Ramirez-Llodra et al.,
   2010). For example, vast extents (~2,000 km^2) of cold-water coral
   reefs, some shown to be thousands of years old (>8,000 years), have
   been found in Norwegian waters in past decades (Fosså et al., 2005).
   Cold-water coral reefs have now been discovered in every ocean, forming
   important assemblages within the deep ocean that provide critical
   habitat to thousands of other species, including many commercially
   important species.

   Human communities derive many benefits from coral reefs including food,
   income, recreation, coastal protection, cultural settings, and many
   other ecological goods and services (Cinner et al., 2009; Costanza et
   al., 2014). Despite their biological diversity, productivity and
   importance to humans, both warm and cold-water coral reefs are being
   heavily impacted by human activities due to both local and global
   influences (Hall-Spencer et al., 2002; Burke et al., 2011). As a
   result, many coral reefs are rapidly declining across the world. While
   local factors can have significant impact on coral reefs (e.g.,
   pollution, overfishing, and the physical destruction of reefs), changes
   in ocean temperature and chemistry due to anthropogenic activities are
   dramatically reducing the distribution, abundance, and survival of
   entire coral reef ecosystems (Gattuso et al., 2014b; Hoegh-Guldberg et
   al., 2014). Given these risks and the importance of coral reefs to
   humans and marine biodiversity, the present paper focuses on the
   challenges that warm and cold-water coral reef ecosystems and their
   human communities are facing, particularly those posed by rapidly
   warming and acidifying oceans.

Distribution, Abundance, and Importance of Coral Reef Ecosystems

   Warm-water coral reefs are prominent ecosystems within coastal areas of
   the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic oceans (Figures 1A,B), where they are
   typically found in a broad band (30°S to 30°N) of warm, sunlit,
   alkaline, clear, and relatively nutrient deficient ocean waters
   (Kleypas et al., 1999b). Here, Scleractinian or reef-building corals
   proliferate, depositing copious amounts of calcium carbonate. As corals
   die, their dead skeletons build up over time and are “glued” together
   by the activities of other organisms such as encrusting red coralline
   algae (Glynn and Manzello, 2015). Other organisms such as calcifying
   green algae, invertebrates, and phytoplankton also contribute to the
   overall carbonate budget of warm water coral reefs (Hutchings and
   Hoegh-Guldberg, 2009), leading to three-dimensional calcium carbonate
   structures that build up over hundreds and thousands of years. In turn,
   the three-dimensional structures (Figure 1C) within warm-water reef
   systems creates habitat for hundreds of thousands of species, many of
   which support coastal human populations with food, income, and other
   ecological goods and services such as coastal protection. Coral reefs
   are also important sources for bio-prospecting and the development of
   novel pharmaceuticals. The asset value of coral reefs has been
   estimated as close to $1 trillion (Hoegh-Guldberg, 2015) with the
   economic value of goods and services from coral reefs exceeding $375
   billion annually, with benefits flowing to over 500 million people in
   at least 90 countries worldwide (Burke et al., 2011; Gattuso et al.,
   2014b).

   As light levels decrease with depth, decalcification dominates and the
   overall carbonate balance of reef ecosystems shifts to negative (Barnes
   and Chalker, 1990; Bongaerts et al., 2010a). Under these conditions,
   Scleractinian corals and their symbionts persist with reefs being
   referred to as “mesophotic” (Bongaerts et al., 2010a, 2011; Robinson C.
   et al., 2010). In these habitats, colonies of Scleractinian corals are
   often platelike in shape, orientating themselves to maximize light
   harvesting under these dim light conditions (Figure 1D). Mesophotic
   reef systems are also primarily restricted to areas where water
   clarity, carbonate ion concentrations, and temperatures are relatively
   high. Like their counterparts in shallower regions, mesophotic reef
   systems play an important role in supporting fisheries and hence human
   livelihoods. Given the difficulty of working at depths of more than 30
   m (beyond SCUBA-diving depth) many species remain to be discovered
   (Bongaerts et al., 2010a). Mesophotic reefs therefore have an unknown
   potential to be sources of novel pharmaceuticals and other potentially
   beneficial compounds (Leal et al., 2012). As a result, their true value
   has probably been underestimated.

   Cold-water corals generally form reefs at much greater depths from 200
   to 2,000 m however in some regions they are found at shallower depths
   (Fosså et al., 2002; Freiwald et al., 2004). Deep-water corals are not
   dependent on light levels as they are not symbiotic with Symbiodinium.
   Due to the colder and more CO[2] rich (and hence less alkaline) waters,
   deep-water corals grow slower than warm-water corals, forming
   aggregations that are variously termed patches, banks, thickets,
   bioherms, mounds, gardens, and massifs. In the absence of significant
   wave action, these fragile and slow growing reefs form aggregations
   that can cover vast tracks of the seabed (e.g., 2,000 km^2 in Norwegian
   waters http://www.lophelia.org/) (Hall-Spencer et al., 2002) and
   involve near mono-specific stands of Scleractinian corals such as
   Lophelia pertusa and Oculina varicosa (Figure 1E). In addition to
   Scleractinian corals, they often exhibit a wide variety of abundant
   coral-like organisms, including soft corals, gorgonians, and
   Alcyonaceans.

Recent Changes in the Extent of Anthropogenic Stresses on Coral Reef
Ecosystems

   Coral reefs are facing growing challenges from the local to global
   effects of human activities. Over the past 200 years, human activities
   have fundamentally changed coastlines, overexploited resources such as
   fish stocks, and polluted coastal waters, to a point where many coral
   reef ecosystems are degrading rapidly (Jackson et al., 2001; Pandolfi
   et al., 2003; Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014b). Warm-water coral reefs, for
   example, have declined by at least 50% over the past 30–50 years in
   large parts of the world's tropical regions (Hughes, 1994; Gardner et
   al., 2003; Bruno and Selig, 2007; De'ath et al., 2012). Similar
   conclusions have been reached for cold-water reefs where human
   activities have put these systems under escalating pressure from the
   mid-1980s onwards. Key drivers of the destruction of cold-water reefs
   include commercial bottom trawling, hydrocarbon exploration and
   production, deep sea mining, cable and pipeline placement, pollution,
   waste disposal, coral exploitation, and trade, and destructive
   scientific sampling (Hall-Spencer et al., 2002; Turley et al., 2007;
   Roberts and Cairns, 2014). The increase in impacts from human
   activities is a result of rapid advances in technologies for
   visualizing and exploiting the biological and mineral resources of deep
   water habitats (Freiwald et al., 2004; Ramirez-Llodra et al., 2010).
   Many populations of deep-sea corals (Scleractinians, gorgonians) have
   very slow turn-over rates and may live for centuries, with some species
   such as black corals (Antipatharians) living for thousands of years.
   The longevity and slow growth rates of these taxa means that recovery
   from anthropogenic stressors will be very slow. The areas inhabited by
   the deep-sea reefs are also a “resource frontier” for hydrocarbon
   extraction and mining of high value and “high-tech” metals (Roberts and
   Cairns, 2014). Hence, it is likely that anthropogenic impacts on these
   reefs will expand. These impacts are also likely to interact with ocean
   warming and acidification (Figure 2A), which pose growing and serious
   risks to coral reef ecosystems on their own. The direct impact of these
   changes to coral reefs have been growing since the early 1980s
   (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007, 2014; Eakin C. M. et al., 2010; Gattuso
   et al., 2014b). The latter are the direct result of the burning of
   fossil fuels and have been driving growing impacts on warm water coral
   reefs since the early 1980s. Understanding and solving both local and
   global threats to coral reefs will be critically important if they are
   to survive some of the greatest rates of environmental change in the
   recent history of the Earth (Hönisch et al., 2012; Pörtner et al.,
   2014).

   Figure 2. (A) Linkages between the build-up of atmospheric CO[2] and
   the slowing of coral calcification due to ocean acidification.
   Approximately 30% of the atmospheric CO[2] emitted by humans has been
   taken up by the ocean (IPCC, 2013) where it combined with water to
   produce carbonic acid, which releases a proton that combines with a
   carbonate ion. This decreases the concentration of carbonate, making it
   unavailable to marine calcifiers such as corals. (B) Temperature,
   [CO[2]][atm], and carbonate-ion concentrations reconstructed for the
   past 420,000 years. Carbonate concentrations were calculated (Lewis et
   al., 1998) from [CO[2]][atm] and temperature deviations from conditions
   in the decade of the 2000s with the Vostok Ice Core data set (Petit et
   al., 1999), assuming constant salinity (34 parts per trillion), mean
   sea temperature (25°C), and total alkalinity (2,300 mmol kg^−1).
   Acidity of the ocean varies by ± 0.1 pH units over the past 420,000
   years (individual values not shown). The thresholds for major changes
   to coral communities are indicated for thermal stress (+2°C) and
   carbonate-ion concentrations ([carbonate] = 200 μmol kg^−1, approximate
   aragonite saturation ~Ω[aragonite] = 3.3; [CO[2]][atm] = 480 ppm).
   Coral Reef Scenarios CRS-A, CRS-B, and CRS-C are indicated as A, B, and
   C, respectively, with analogs from extant reefs. Red arrows pointing
   progressively toward the right-hand top square indicate the pathway
   that is being followed toward [CO[2]][atm] of more than 500 ppm. From
   Hoegh-Guldberg et al. (2007) with permission of Science Magazine.

   Warm-water coral reefs are largely dependent on the physical and
   chemical changes occurring in the surface of the ocean, whereas
   cold-water reef systems are tied relatively more to the broad scale
   conditions of the bulk ocean (Freiwald et al., 2004; Eakin C. M. et
   al., 2010). In this respect, there are likely to be differences in
   terms of the rate and characteristics of the changes that are
   occurring. These differences also translate into different trajectories
   when it comes to near and long-term projections of planetary warming
   and ocean acidification.

   Warm-water coral reef environments have experienced relatively small
   amounts of variability in terms of temperature and carbonate ion
   concentrations, even with the relatively substantial swings in average
   global temperature and atmospheric CO[2] concentration during the
   glacial cycle (Figure 2B). Warm-water coral reefs contracted toward the
   equator during glacial periods, and re-expanded along the tropical and
   subtropical coastlines of the world during the intervening warm periods
   (Hubbard, 2015). While these changes were rapid relative to geological
   time frames, they occurred over periods of 10,000 years or more and are
   slow when compared to climatic changes that have occurred since
   pre-industrial. While our understanding of how conditions have changed
   in terms of the habitat of deep-water coral reefs over geological time
   is limited, it is very likely that conditions varied even less over
   these long periods than those surrounding the warm-water coral reefs.

   It is virtually certain that the upper ocean has warmed between 1971
   and 2010 and likely that it has warmed between 1870s and 1971 (IPCC,
   2013). These changes are consistent with those expected from the
   associated rise in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere
   (IPCC, 2013). The average sea surface temperatures (SST) of the Indian,
   Atlantic, and Pacific oceans have increased by 0.65, 0.41, and 0.31°C
   during 1950–2009 (Table 30-1 in Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014). The
   influence of long-term patterns of climate variability such as the
   Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) contribute to variability at regional
   scales and confound efforts to detect and attribute regional changes to
   anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014).
   Nonetheless, examination of the Hadley Centre HadISST1.1 data (Rayner
   et al., 2003) over 60 years (1950–2009) reveals significant warming
   trends in SST for many sub-regions of the ocean (Table 30-1 in
   Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014). Significant trends are clearly
   demonstrated within the six major warm-water coral reef regions, with
   the exception of the Gulf of Mexico/Caribbean Sea region (Table 1).
   Rates of increase in SST in the warm-water coral reef regions range
   from 0.07°C (west Pacific Ocean) to 0.13°C (Coral Triangle and
   southeast Asia) per decade, resulting in an overall increase in the
   regions of between 0.44 and 0.79°C during the period from 1950 to 2009.

   warm-water coral reef provinces (Figure 1B) over the period 1950–2009

   HadISST1.1 data set (Rayner et al., 2003).

   In addition to the heat content and temperature of the upper layers of
   the ocean, the research community is virtually certain that ocean
   chemistry is also changing as a result of the increasing amounts of
   CO[2] entering the Ocean (IPCC, 2013). Observed increases in salinity
   at tropical latitudes are consistent with the amplification of the
   global hydrological cycle (Durack and Wijffels, 2010; Durack et al.,
   2012), including rainfall, which have significant implications for
   coastal ecosystems such as warm-water coral reefs. At regional levels,
   changes in storm and rainfall intensity also have the potential to
   influence coastal water quality, which is important to coral reefs, as
   a result of the interplay between droughts, coastal and catchment
   erosion, and sudden inundation (flood) events. The impact of climate
   change adds to those from other human activities that are already
   impacting water quality, coastal erosion and biological systems.

   Average global sea levels are increasing by an average of 3.2 mm
   year^−1 (over 1993–2010) as a result of warming of the ocean (thus
   increasing volume) and the melting of land ice (IPCC, 2013). Sea level
   rise varies between regions as a result of differences in local
   oceanography and geology and the influence of long-term variation in
   regional climate. Some areas that have significant warm-water coral
   reefs, such as Southeast Asia and northern Australia, have reported
   rates of sea level rise of around 10 mm year^−1. While the direct
   attribution of changes in regional wind strength, storm intensity and
   frequency to global warming is challenging due to long-term
   variability, there is considerable evidence that the frequency and
   intensity of the strongest tropical storms in some regions (e.g., North
   Atlantic; IPCC, 2013) has increased since the 1970s. The combination of
   higher sea levels and more intense storm systems is likely to increase
   the amount of force exerted by wave action on coastal areas, which has
   implications for coastal infrastructure, as well as the state of
   ecosystems such as coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass beds (Hamylton
   et al., 2013; Saunders et al., 2014).

   Changes have also occurred in the pH of ocean surface waters over the
   past 100 years, a phenomenon which is referred to as ocean
   acidification (Kleypas et al., 1999a; Caldeira and Wickett, 2003;
   Gattuso et al., 2014a). As CO[2] enters the ocean, it reacts with water
   increasing hydrogen ion concentration (thus decreasing ocean pH) and
   decreasing the carbonate ion concentration. While the overall change in
   ocean pH appears small (0.1 pH units over the past 150 years), this is
   actually a 26% increase in the concentration of hydrogen ions.
   Experimental evidence shows a reduction in carbonate ions with ocean
   acidification is biologically significant, since it can affect the rate
   at which marine organisms, such as corals build their calcareous
   structures (Kroeker et al., 2013). However, understanding of the
   mechanisms driving the sensitivity of coral calcification to ocean
   chemistry, such as the response of the pH of the internal calcifying
   fluid in which the coral skeleton forms to the concentration of
   dissolved organic carbon, are only being untangled (Comeau et al.,
   2017). These changes in ocean chemistry are temperature dependent, with
   the CO[2] absorption and consequently acidification being highest when
   waters are cooler. The aragonite (one form of calcium carbonate)
   saturation state (Ω[arag]) is essentially the ratio between the
   concentrations of calcium and carbonate ions (Doney et al., 2009). The
   aragonite saturation state shows a similar distribution to sea surface
   temperature with Ω[arag] being highest in the warmest ocean regions and
   lowest in polar regions (Jiang et al., 2015). Surface waters of the
   ocean are generally supersaturated with respect to aragonite (Ω[arag] >
   1). However, in warmer waters where Ω[arag] is not projected to fall to
   <1 (thus undersaturated with respect to aragonite, Figure 3),
   substantial impacts are likely to still occur on calcifying organisms.
   There is substantial evidence that carbonate accretion on warm-water
   coral reefs approaches zero or becomes negative when Ω[arag] falls
   below 3.3 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007; Chan and Connolly, 2013), a
   level likely to be reached in tropical surface waters within the next
   few decades at current rates of greenhouse gas emission (Hoegh-Guldberg
   et al., 2007; Ricke et al., 2013).

   and 394 ppm levels in 2012. Four hundred and fifty ppm is projected to
   be reached during 2030s under Representative Concentration Pathway
   (RCP) 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5, and to approach, but not reach 450 ppm, during
   2040s under RCP 2.6 (IPCC 2013). Eight hundred ppm is projected to be
   reached during 2080s under RCP 8.5 only. Fields are calculated from the
   model output of dissolved inorganic carbon concentration, alkalinity
   concentration, temperature, and salinity, together with the chemistry

   The global distribution of cold-water corals is at least partly limited
   by the depth of the aragonite saturation horizon, Ω[arag] = 1.0
   (Guinotte et al., 2006). Aragonite saturation state diminishes with
   depth, due partly to hydrostatic pressure and lower temperature, with a
   distinct aragonite “saturation horizon” below which waters become
   under-saturated for aragonite (Ω[arag] <1) (Jiang et al., 2015). The
   saturation horizon is a complex outcome of ocean circulation,
   temperature, CO[2] concentrations, salinity, metabolic activity, and
   the concentrations of organic compounds and occurs at depths between
   200 and 3,500 m, depending on the latitude and the ocean (Orr et al.,
   2005; Doney et al., 2009; Rhein et al., 2013; Jiang et al., 2015).
   Surface waters and waters at 50 m depth are mostly supersaturated
   throughout the global ocean (Jiang et al., 2015), however in western
   Arctic waters, the area of under-saturated waters in the upper 250 m
   north of 70°N has increased from 5 to 31% between 1990s and 2010 (Qi et
   al., 2017). At 500 m, large areas of undersaturated Ω[arag] water are
   found in the northern and equatorial Pacific ocean. At 1,000 m, Ω[arag]
   < 1.8 over all ocean basins and at 2.000 m, Ω[arag] < 1.0 across all
   the Pacific and Indian Ocean and parts of the Atlantic Ocean. Ocean
   acidification is proceeding at higher rates at high latitudes than at
   lower latitudes (Figure 3) resulting in a shoaling of the aragonite
   saturation horizon. There is now evidence to show that the aragonite
   saturation horizon has shoaled since the Preindustrial Period (Turley
   et al., 2007). For example, in the north east Pacific (from 33.5 to
   50.0°N) the aragonite saturation horizon has shoaled by 19.6 m in 11
   years (2001–2012) and, at this rate, the entire water column in the
   northern section of this region is projected to become undersaturated
   within 50–90 years (Chu et al., 2016).

Biological Responses to a Rapidly Warming and Acidifying Ocean

   Not surprisingly, the scale and pace of the physical and chemical
   changes occurring in the ocean are driving a large range of fundamental
   responses in marine organisms, ecosystems, and regions (Hoegh-Guldberg
   et al., 2014; Pörtner et al., 2014). Equally significant, is the
   observation that relatively small amounts of change have resulted in
   quite substantial biological impacts, with clear evidence of non-linear
   trends, tipping points, and otherwise complex responses. Coral
   responses to changes in ocean conditions, in particular mass coral
   bleaching, provide particularly compelling examples of the consequences
   of a rapidly changing ocean for organisms, ecosystems, and dependent
   societies.

   The symbiosis between warm-water corals and Symbiodinium (Figures 4A,B)
   is very sensitive to changes in the physical and chemical environment
   surrounding corals. Short periods of high or low temperature and/or
   light, or exposure to toxins like cyanide, can drive the breakdown of
   the symbiosis, resulting in the loss of the brown symbionts and a
   subsequent paling (hence “bleaching”) of the coral host
   (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999). Coral bleaching involves the breakdown of the
   symbiosis between Scleractinian corals and Symbiodinium, which may
   recover if conditions are not too anomalous for too long. While
   bleaching of coral tissues has been reported on the scale of colonies
   or groups of colonies for at least 100 years (Yonge and Nichols, 1931),
   reports of bleaching at large geographic scales (Figures 4C,D, example
   of affected coral reefs in American Samoa from late 2015) was unknown
   to the scientific literature until 1979. Since the early 1980s,
   however, mass coral bleaching has affected entire reefs and regions,
   often resulting in significant mortality of reef-building corals. The
   absence of pre 1979 scientific reports in addition to the close
   relationship between bleaching and elevated sea temperature, plus
   considerable laboratory, and mesocosm studies, strongly support the
   conclusion that mass coral bleaching and mortality are novel and are
   caused by warm water coral reefs being exposed to rising sea
   temperatures (Hoegh-Guldberg and Smith, 1989; Glynn, 1993, 2012;
   Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Glynn et al., 2001; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007,
   2014; Baker et al., 2008; Eakin C. M. et al., 2010; Strong et al.,
   2011; Gattuso et al., 2014b). The latest cycle of mass coral bleaching
   in 2016 (Hoegh-Guldberg and Ridgway, 2016) is reputedly the worst on
   record and accompanies the warmest years on record (King and Hawkins,
   2016;
   https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-noaa-data-show-2016-warmest-yea
   r-on-record-globally).

   Mass coral bleaching and mortality can be triggered by small (1–2°C)
   SST increases above the long-term summer maxima for a region (Strong et
   al., 2011). If temperatures are higher for longer, the amount of coral
   bleaching will increase, driving increased mortality (Hoegh-Guldberg,
   1999; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007; Eakin C. M. et al., 2010). There is
   a strong link between the size and length of temperature extremes and
   mass coral bleaching and mortality (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Strong et
   al., 2004, 2011; Eakin C. M. et al., 2010). These relationships are
   used with satellite data to derive anomalies in SST to monitor the
   frequency and intensity of mass coral bleaching and mortality (Strong
   et al., 2004, 2011). For this reason, there is a high level of
   confidence that the increases in mass coral bleaching and mortality
   since the early 1980s are due to anthropogenic climate change in
   particular ocean warming (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014). The loss of
   symbionts from coral tissues can have immediate effects through the
   loss of photosynthetic energy, and lead to starvation, disease,
   reproductive failure, and a loss of competitive ability relative to
   other organisms on coral reefs (Hoegh-Guldberg and Smith, 1989; Glynn,
   1993, 2012; Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Baker et al., 2008; Hoegh-Guldberg et
   al., 2014; Glynn and Manzello, 2015).

   Understanding how the positions of ocean isotherms (lines of similar
   temperatures) are changing and how fast across the ocean surface
   (“velocity of climate change”, Burrows et al., 2011, 2014) provides
   insight into whether or not coral populations will be able to move,
   adapt or acclimatize fast enough to changing sea temperatures
   (Hoegh-Guldberg, 2012; Pörtner et al., 2014). Some of the highest rates
   of climate velocity (up to 200 km per decade) were observed in ocean
   tropical regions (over 1960–2010), driven by shallow spatial gradients
   in temperature (Burrows et al., 2011, 2014). Observed rates of
   distribution shifts for individual warm-water coral species linked to
   increases in sea surface temperatures range from 0 to 150 km per
   decade, with an average shift rate of 30 km per decade (Yamano et al.,
   2011; Poloczanska et al., 2013), suggesting that corals and coral
   ecosystems may be unable to keep up with warming rates (Hoegh-Guldberg,
   2012; Burrows et al., 2014; García Molinos et al., 2015).

   The possible reduced influence of extremes from climate change with
   depth has led to the speculation that deeper (>40 m) mesophotic coral
   reefs may offer a potential refuge against the otherwise rapid changes
   in temperature, storm intensity, and chemistry that are typical of
   shallow-water (0–30 m) coral reef environments (Bongaerts et al.,
   2010a). The “Deep Reef Refugia” hypothesis has been explored by a
   number of groups who are finding substantial differences in terms of
   the rate of warming and acidification with depth, as well as examples
   of species that may span the mesophotic zone to shallow reef areas.
   Recent work however, has revealed that mesophotic reefs may not be
   immune to the impacts of storms (Bongaerts et al., 2013). Also,
   populations of what appear to be the same coral species appear to have
   considerable genetic structure as a function of depth. This is
   important given that it implies a high degree of specialization, local
   adaptation, and even speciation, by corals living at different depths,
   with the implication that mesophotic corals may not be able to survive
   in shallow-water environments and vice versa, reducing the potential
   for mesophotic environments to provide refugia for shallow water
   Scleractinian corals. This reduces the significance of deeper water
   populations as a source of recruits for regenerating damaged areas on
   shallow water coral reefs (Bongaerts et al., 2010b, 2015). In addition
   to warming oceans, corals are also sensitive to changes to the pH and
   the carbonate chemistry of seawater as a result of ocean acidification
   (Kleypas et al., 1999a; Gattuso et al., 2014a). These changes affect
   organisms in a variety of ways, including reducing calcification rates
   in a wide array of corals and other organisms in laboratory, mesocosm,
   and field studies (Gattuso et al., 1998; Reynaud et al., 2003; Kleypas
   et al., 2006; Dove et al., 2013; Kroeker et al., 2013; Gattuso et al.,
   2014a).

   Long-lived corals from the field have provided an opportunity for
   retrospective analysis of how growth has varied over long periods of
   time (De'ath et al., 2009; Lough, 2010, 2011). Calcification
   measurements from coral cores from 328 colonies of the massive coral
   Porites growing on the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, for example,
   have revealed that calcification by these corals has declined by 14.2%
   since 1990. This appears to unprecedented on the Great Barrier Reef for
   at least the last 400 years (De'ath et al., 2009) (but see D'Olivo et
   al., 2013; Figure 5). Given the complexity of the environmental changes
   occurring in places like the Great Barrier Reef, it is difficult to
   assign specific drivers of this decline. However, the combined effects
   of elevated warming and acidification from climate change, along with
   declining water quality, appear to be significant drivers of the
   changes observed (D'Olivo et al., 2013). Declining growth and
   calcification rates have also been detected for Porites colonies in the
   Red Sea (Cantin et al., 2010) and at several locations in Southeast
   Asia (Tanzil et al., 2009).

   and gray bands indicate 95% confidence intervals for the predicted

   2005 (A), primarily due to declining extension (B). Density declines
   from 1900 onward (C). The 1572–2001 data show that calcification
   increased weakly from ~1.62 before 1,700 to ~1.76 in ~1850, after which
   it remained relatively constant (D) before a weak decline since ~1960.

   Studies of the influence of rapidly warming and acidifying conditions
   on mesophotic coral reefs are absent. Given that these reef systems
   cover roughly the equivalent area of shallow water coral reefs,
   understanding how environmental changes are likely to influence these
   important areas in terms of habitat the fisheries and biodiversity is
   important and should be a priority of future research (Bongaerts et
   al., 2010a). Linking the physiological and ecological response of
   mesophotic reefs to changes in pH and carbonate ion concentration will
   also be important in the context of understanding how mesophotic coral
   reef ecosystems will be affected by the shoaling of the saturation
   horizon in regions such as off Hawaii.

   Our understanding of how deep ocean environments are likely to respond
   to changes in ocean temperature and chemistry are at an early stage.
   Like mesophotic coral reefs, little is known about the sensitivity of
   cold-water coral reefs to changes in temperature. As cold-water corals
   tend not to have a mutualistic symbiosis with Symbiodinium, their
   response is naturally different to that of symbiotic Scleractinian
   corals. As with mesophotic coral reefs, there is much more to be
   discovered with respect to how these critically important cold-water
   coral reefs are likely to respond to steadily warming and acidifying
   ocean. Coral reefs in the deep-sea have been identified as particularly
   vulnerable to the effects of ocean acidification; in part because of
   the numerical predominance of calcifying taxa, and in part because the
   pre-industrial carbonate levels at the depths and temperatures they
   inhabit were already low (Freiwald et al., 2004). Experimental studies
   reveal that short-term exposures of important deep-water corals such as
   L. pertusa to a reduction in pH of around 0.15–0.3 units resulted in a
   decrease in calcification rates of between 30 and 56% (Maier et al.,
   2009). However, subsequent work has shown that L. pertusa can
   acclimatize (i.e., maintain considerable calcification) to declining
   aragonite levels modifying skeletal structure and skeletal strength
   (Form and Riebesell, 2012; Hennige et al., 2015). Observations of
   deep-sea corals in under-saturated waters from the SW Pacific also
   suggest some species-specific tolerance, however growth rates are
   extremely low and in under-saturated conditions dead coral skeletons
   dissolve rapidly (Bostock et al., 2015; Thresher et al., 2015). Whether
   cold-water corals will be able to adjust to rapid warming and ocean
   acidification projected for the coming century is unknown. However,
   analyses of cold-water coral fossils suggest that a combination of
   declining aragonite and oxygen saturations will reduce the distribution
   of cold-water corals (Thiagarajan et al., 2013).

   While coral species and their symbionts have received a major amount of
   focus in terms of the effect of ocean warming and acidification on
   warm-water coral reef ecosystems, there is a growing number of studies
   that have revealed impacts on a broader range of reef organisms. Among
   the most affected are calcifying algae, calcareous phytoplankton,
   molluscs, and echinoderms, with the larval stages of some organisms
   being more sensitive than the adult phase (Kroeker et al., 2013).
   Bioeroding organisms also respond to both warmer and more acidic
   conditions (Dove et al., 2013; Fang et al., 2013; Reyes-Nivia et al.,
   2013). The sponge, Cliona orientalis, increased biomass and bioerosion
   capability when exposed to warmer and more acidic conditions,
   implicating a role of this sponge in helping tip the carbonate balance
   of reefs toward net erosion (Dove et al., 2013; Fang et al., 2013).
   Similar observations have been made for bio-eroding endolithic algal
   communities, where small shifts in ocean temperature and acidity (i.e.,
   CO[2] levels) enhanced skeletal dissolution and was associated with
   increased endolithic biomass and respiration under elevated
   temperatures and CO[2] levels (Reyes-Nivia et al., 2013).

   In addition to impacts on growth, calcification, and reproduction,
   there is growing evidence of impacts on a range of physiological
   systems of coral reef organisms. Ocean acidification, for example,
   impairs the homing ability and olfactory discrimination of some coral
   reef fish, with potential consequences for the ability of fish to
   detect and avoid predators (Munday et al., 2009; Dixson et al., 2010).
   At present, there are few reports on the influence or not of ocean
   acidification on the metabolic performance of tropical fish species. In
   this regard, it will be important to explore whether or not tropical
   fish have the same challenges that temperate fish have when it comes to
   respiratory gas transport and acid–base balance (Esbaugh et al., 2012;
   Pörtner et al., 2014). Physiological impacts combined with ecological
   impacts and habitat degradation, are likely to generate “surprises” for
   complex ecosystems such as those associated with both cold and warm
   water coral reefs.

Ecological Ramifications of Rapid Change

   The impact of climate change on coral reef organisms has ramifications
   for ecosystems, some of which may be transformative in terms of their
   effects on primary productivity, food web dynamics, habitat forming
   species, disease ecology, and many other aspects (Hoegh-Guldberg and
   Bruno, 2010). The recent decline in the abundance of warm-water coral
   reefs (Hughes, 1994; Gardner et al., 2003; Bruno and Selig, 2007;
   De'ath et al., 2012), however, illustrates the complex yet fundamental
   ways that marine ecosystems are changing in response to rapid rates of
   ocean warming and acidification. The ecological ramifications of rapid
   global change for mesophotic coral reefs are less well-known or
   understood than those of warm-water shallow reef systems. Similarly,
   threats to cold-water coral reefs less well-understood and undoubtedly
   involve a different mix of local and global drivers (Turley et al.,
   2007; Roberts and Cairns, 2014).

   The major ecological responses of warm-water coral reefs to climate
   change have their origins in the response of reef-building corals to
   warming and acidification, and their role as framework builders within
   typical carbon reef systems (Gattuso et al., 1998; Kleypas et al.,
   1999a; Reynaud et al., 2003; Maier et al., 2009; Kroeker et al., 2013).
   As described above, corals are sensitive to small changes in
   temperature, light, and a number of other environmental variables,
   responding by disassociating from the dinoflagellate symbionts that
   populate their tissues (i.e., bleaching). Small changes in temperature
   are driving decreased growth and reproduction and increased mortality
   of corals in many parts of the world (Hoegh-Guldberg and Smith, 1989;
   Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014). As corals lose
   their symbionts, they become vulnerable to death and disease, as well
   as being less able to compete with other benthic organisms. These
   changes have driven episodes of coral mortality associated with thermal
   stress, with the catastrophic loss of corals in particular regions over
   the past 30 years (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Baker et al., 2008; Eakin C.
   M. et al., 2010; Glynn, 2012). While some coral reefs have recovered
   over subsequent decades many others have not. Regional differences in
   the ability to recover are linked to the presence and absence of other
   factors affecting the resilience of reef building corals and other reef
   related organisms such as levels of herbivory, macroalgal cover, and
   coral recruitment rates (Baker et al., 2008). The reduced resilience of
   reef building corals as a result of thermal stress is likely to be
   exacerbated by increasing ocean acidification, which has the potential
   to reduce the ability of corals to grow, calcify, and recover from
   disturbances. While teasing apart the effects of rising temperatures
   and increasing amounts of ocean acidification is difficult, both
   thermal stress, and acidification have the potential to reduce the
   ability of corals to recover from stresses (Hughes et al., 2007). This
   may help explain why stressors such as cyclones, which do not appear to
   have increased in frequency over the past 30 years (Callaghan and
   Power, 2011; IPCC, 2013), appear to be having longer-lasting impacts on
   coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef (De'ath et al., 2012).

   Mass coral bleaching reduces the energy available to corals, leading to
   physiological compromise. Warm-water corals, for example, exude mucus
   which is rich with the excess carbohydrates which provides food for a
   large number of molluscs, crustaceans, worms, ciliates, fish, and many
   other organisms (Baker et al., 2008; Wild et al., 2011). It also
   appears to play an important role in preventing the settlement of
   fouling and disease organisms. Mucus secretion, however, is reduced in
   bleached corals, potentially leading to increased disease (Harvell et
   al., 2007). Bleaching can also directly influence growth and
   reproduction of corals, as well is their tendency to succumb to a range
   of diseases (Harvell et al., 1999, 2007; Bruno and Selig, 2007; Baker
   et al., 2008). A reduction in reef-building corals raises the threat
   that a considerable proportion of the mega-diversity associated with
   coral reefs will face extirpation or, for some species, global
   extinction (Glynn, 2012). A meta-analysis of 17 independent studies,
   undertaken by Wilson et al. (2006), revealed that fish species reliant
   on live coral cover for food and shelter (some 62% of reef fish
   species) decreased in abundance within 3 years of disturbance events
   such bleaching, storms, and outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish that
   reduced coral cover by 10% or more.

   The loss of calcifiers such as corals and calcareous algae due to
   warming and other stressors contributes to a reduced rate of community
   calcification, which is exacerbated by increases in dissolution and
   bioerosion as the water column becomes more acidified. Coral bleaching
   events driven by elevated temperatures has also been shown to shift
   carbonate budgets of coral reefs from net accretion to net erosion
   (DeCarlo et al., 2017; Januchowski-Hartley et al., 2017). Sixteen years
   later, a third of reefs that were considered ecologically recovering
   (Graham et al., 2015) did not show positive carbon budgets
   (Januchowski-Hartley et al., 2017). Reefs remaining in negative
   carbonate budgets were those where massive coral loss was high and
   recovery of branched corals was low. The composition of reef benthic
   communities, which are sensitive to thermal stress, have an influence
   on the sensitivity of coral reef ecosystems to ocean acidification
   (DeCarlo et al., 2017). In long-term studies done in mesocosms,
   carbonate balance of reefs tips toward overall dissolution under
   concentrations of CO[2] of more than 450 ppm (Dove et al., 2013), which
   matches similar conclusions from previous experimental work (Anthony et
   al., 2008; Wild et al., 2011; Andersson and Gledhill, 2013) and from
   the geographical distribution of coral reefs in relation to the
   aragonite saturation state of seawater (Kleypas et al., 1999b;
   Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007).

Evidence for Evolutionary Responses and the Relocation of Ecosystems

   The strong relationship between short periods of elevated sea
   temperature in mass coral bleaching and mortality within warm-water
   coral reefs has been used to project how communities of reef building
   corals might change as ocean temperatures increase as a result of
   anthropogenic climate change (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Done et al., 2003;
   Donner et al., 2005; Frieler et al., 2012). Inherent to the conclusions
   of these studies, however, is the requirement that the thermal
   threshold of corals remain relatively constant over time. Evidence from
   the past 25 years, over which time satellite measurement programmes
   have used a simple algorithm based on sea surface temperature anomalies
   (relative to the average summer-time maxima 1985–1993) to predict when
   and where mass coral bleaching and mortality is likely to occur. This
   strongly suggests that little change has occurred in the sensitivity of
   reef building corals to thermal stress (Eakin C. et al., 2010; Strong
   et al., 2011; Hoegh-Guldberg, 2012). Nonetheless, it is important to
   consider potential evolutionary responses of reef-building corals over
   the next 100 years as well as the potential for coral reef ecosystems
   to relocate, as conditions change. Due to the dearth of information
   available about mesophotic and cold-water corals, this discussion will
   be restricted to the evidence for warm-water coral reefs.

   Other than dying, corals have the option of acclimatizing, evolving or
   relocating as conditions within a region become sub-optimal
   (Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014a). Reef -building corals, like all organisms, can
   adjust their phenotype or acclimate to match local conditions to some
   extent (Gates and Edmunds, 1999; Middlebrook et al., 2010, 2012).
   However, there is little or no evidence that acclimatization has
   resulted in an upward shift in the thermal tolerance of reef-building
   corals (Eakin C. et al., 2010; Hoegh-Guldberg, 2012; Hoegh-Guldberg et
   al., 2014). Corals appear able to shift the relative ratio of different
   genetic clades or varieties of Symbiodinium within the one coral
   colony, which is correlated with tolerance to extreme temperatures
   (Rowan et al., 1997; Berkelmans and van Oppen, 2006; Jones et al.,
   2008). Further investigation of these putatively more tolerant
   varieties reveals a physiological trade-off in terms of reduced growth
   and competitiveness (Jones and Berkelmans, 2011).

   A few studies (Glynn et al., 2001; Maynard et al., 2008a,b) have
   proposed that the thermal tolerance of reef building corals has
   increased over time, with less corals bleaching for similar amounts of
   thermal stress. The problem with these studies is several-fold
   (Hoegh-Guldberg, 2009). For example, the assessment of stress levels
   was restricted to temperature alone despite the fact that variation in
   parameters such as the light intensity (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Mumby et
   al., 2001) and water flow rates over a reef (Nakamura and Van Woesik,
   2001) can significantly modify the overall stress levels arising from
   elevated temperature at small scales (Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014a). As well,
   studies like that of Maynard et al. (2008a) investigated community
   level responses, and hence are unable to distinguish the loss of
   fragile species as opposed to the specific acclimatization and/or
   adaptation of individual species. Evidence for acclimatization in other
   reef organisms has exposed some intriguing possibilities, such as
   transgenerational acclimatization, where organisms inherit improved
   tolerances from parents that have been previously exposed to high
   levels of stress. For example, some coral reef fishes being exposed to
   higher CO[2] levels prior to producing the next generation (Donelson et
   al., 2012; Miller et al., 2012). Whether or not this mechanism operates
   within corals is unknown, although the very observation that the same
   satellite temperature threshold still works after more than 25 years is
   evidence that thresholds are not changing very rapidly. As observed by
   Donner et al. (2005), the required rate of adaptation needs to match
   the rate of increase in sea temperatures or ~0.1–0.2°C per decade.

   Genetic adaptation has also been suggested as a mechanism by which
   coral populations might be able to keep up with rapid changes in ocean
   temperature. Like all organisms, corals and their symbionts have
   adapted to local temperature conditions, a fact embodied by the fact
   that thresholds used by satellites for predicting mass coral bleaching
   and mortality are tied closely to local temperature conditions (Strong
   et al., 2011). Adapting to local conditions, however, has probably
   taken hundreds if not thousands of years and is slowed by the fact that
   reef building corals have generation times from 5 to over 100 years
   (Babcock, 1991). As a result, reef building corals do not have the
   population characteristics that would favor rates of evolution that
   would enable them to keep up with an environment that is changing
   faster than any time in the past 65 million years if not 300 million
   years (Hönisch et al., 2012). Several researchers have suggested that
   corals might “evolve” by swapping their symbionts for more thermally
   adapted varieties (Buddemeier and Fautin, 1993). Evidence of this,
   however, has not eventuated. These propositions also suffer from the
   problem that both the coral and the symbiont need to adapt to
   temperature change (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2002; Stat et al., 2006,
   2009; Hoegh-Guldberg, 2012, 2014a). There are several observations of
   the shuffling of strains of Symbiodinium within the one host in
   response to warming (Rowan et al., 1997). These changes, however, are
   examples of acclimatization as opposed to genetic adaptation
   (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2002). In this regard, the advent of completely
   new symbiotic association between coral and a novel strain of
   Symbiodinium, hence a “new symbiotic genotype” has never been observed.

   A third and final response by organisms facing rapidly changing
   conditions might be to relocate to new areas, which has been documented
   for a large number of marine plants and animals (Poloczanska et al.,
   2013, 2014). New records of several coral reef species have been
   reported at high latitude locations (Precht and Aronson, 2004; Yamano
   et al., 2011) which is consistent with the proposition that corals
   might shift to higher latitudes. There is also ample evidence that
   small increases in ocean temperature in the past have resulted in the
   appearance of coral reefs at slightly higher latitudes than where they
   are found today (Precht and Aronson, 2004; Greenstein and Pandolfi,
   2008). While these reports are interesting, they are not sufficient to
   support the notion that whole coral reef ecosystems will shift
   successfully to higher latitudes as anthropogenic warming of the ocean
   continues which raises some important considerations. Firstly, how will
   ecosystem structure and function of coral reefs be affected if only a
   portion of species in the ecosystem shift, and which of these are the
   critical components for ecosystem services. Secondly, reduced light
   levels along with decreasing aragonite saturation are also critical
   factors in determining whether or not carbonate coral reef ecosystems
   will form successfully at higher latitudes. As recognized by Greenstein
   and Pandolfi (2008), other factors (e.g., available shallow water shelf
   habitats) are crucially important for determining whether or not coral
   reef ecosystems will be able to move to higher latitudes. Thirdly,
   analogies to past shifts are limited given that current changes on
   coral reefs today include a multitude of other pressures in addition to
   temperature (e.g., pollution, ocean acidification). And finally, shifts
   in the past occurred over long periods of time during which conditions
   were relatively stable as compared to the extremely rapid changes
   typical of today. Current changes in ocean temperature and acidity will
   continue for centuries, if not millennia, under the current greenhouse
   gas emission pathway, thereby severely limiting the ability of
   populations and adaptive processes to keep up with a rapidly changing
   climate (Hoegh-Guldberg, 2012).

Global Change: Projected Responses to Rapid Ocean Warming and Acidification

   The close relationship between mass coral bleaching and mortality, and
   short periods of elevated sea temperature, provides an opportunity to
   explore how warm-water coral reefs are likely to be affected under
   different climate change scenarios (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999). Using
   projections of sea surface temperature (SST), future temperatures could
   be compared to established thermal thresholds for corals, and the
   frequency and intensity of future mass coral bleaching and estimated
   mortality. This led to the conclusion, which was somewhat controversial
   at the time, that coral reefs would experience mass coral bleaching and
   mortality on a yearly basis as early as 2030–2040. With field
   observations concluding that recovery from disturbances such as mass
   coral bleaching and mortality takes at least 10–20 years, the
   predictions of yearly mass coral bleaching and mortality events suggest
   strongly that coral dominated ecosystems would be unable to cope, and
   would start to disappear around this time. Subsequent studies revealed
   that these conclusions are not far-fetched and matched the expectations
   of a thermal threshold of corals was relatively fixed, as it appears to
   be (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Done et al., 2003; Donner et al., 2005; Eakin
   C. et al., 2010; Eakin C. M. et al., 2010; Frieler et al., 2012).

   Hoegh-Guldberg et al. (2014) repeated the analysis of Hoegh-Guldberg
   (1999) using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) data
   from an ensemble of 10–16 independent models. Historical and unforced
   temperature trends were compared with those from Representative
   Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 (global temperature “about as likely as
   not” to exceed 1.5°C by 2100 relative to 1986–2005) and RCP 8.5 (global
   temperature “very likely” to exceed 3.0°C by 2100 relative to
   1986–2005) in terms of model projections of the future for coral reef
   provinces. Model outputs were constrained to geographic areas (coral
   regions) known to contain warm-water coral reefs. The range in each
   case represents differences between models and model assumptions. Three
   things become apparent. First, the amount of SST warming that we have
   seen so far is very significant in each coral region given that average
   global temperature has warmed by 0.85°C over the period 1880–2012
   (Table 1, Figure 6). Second, differences between the two RCP scenarios
   do not become evident until mid to late century (Table 2, Figure 6).
   Third, only conditions associated with the RCP 2.6 scenario stabilize,
   which is important if evolutionary processes are to be able to operate
   and re-establish coral reef ecosystems in these regions. In the context
   of the preceding discussion, this is the only scenario in which coral
   reefs have any chance of replenishing tropical coastal regions.

   ensembles (see Table SM30-3 in Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014). Observed

   corresponding historical all-forcing simulations. Figure SM30-3 with
   the permission of IPCC AR5 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014).

   Hoegh-Guldberg et al. (2014) also looked at the annual incidence of
   bleaching and mortality events. The proportion of a coral grid cells
   with a reef province (Figures 1B, 7A) that would have a particular
   stress level in any 1 year was calculated and the maximum for each
   decade then plotted. Two levels of stress were examined. The first
   being the amount of warming required to trigger mass bleaching, which
   is around one Degree Heating Months (DHM) (Strong et al., 2011) and is
   shown in Figure 7B. The second was the amount of heat stress required
   to trigger mass mortality events like those that occurred in the
   Maldives, Okinawa, North-West Australia and Palau in 1998, and is
   calculated as five Degree Heating Months Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Figure
   7C). The conclusions from this analysis are very clear. Firstly, the
   risk of mass coral bleaching (DHM ≥ 1) increases steadily over the next
   few decades, affecting all regions of the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and
   eastern Pacific. By contrast, the Western Pacific Ocean, Coral
   Triangle, and Indian Ocean are likely to experience less stress and
   will still have large areas unaffected by annual mass coral bleaching
   by the end of the century. Secondly, conditions that drive mass
   mortality events today (DHM > 5) will spread across most regions by the
   end of the century under RCP 8.5. This risk decreases from RCP 8.5 to
   zero under RCP 2.6 with no regions experiencing annual conditions that
   would cause mass mortality event. Given the time that it takes for
   coral reefs to recover from mass mortality events (10–20 years), there
   is significant risk associated with high greenhouse gas emission
   scenarios given that the damage from these events, even in managed reef
   systems. Even 10% of grid cells being at risk of experiencing a mass
   mortality event would eventually add up to a very low number of
   unaffected areas by the end of century.

   Strong et al., 1997, 2011) and (C) DHM ≥5 (associated with bleaching

   period 1870–2009 using the Hadley Centre Interpolated sea surface
   temperature 1.1 (HadISST1.1) data set. The black line on each graph is
   the maximum annual area value for each decade over the period
   1870–2009. This value is continued through 2010–2099 using Coupled
   Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) data and splits into the
   four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5).
   DHM were produced for each of the four RCPs using the ensembles of CMIP
   models. From these global maps of DHM, the annual percentage of grid
   cells with DHM ≥1 and DHM ≥5 were calculated for each coral region.
   These data were then grouped into decades from which the maximum annual
   proportions were derived. The plotted lines for 2010–2099 are the
   average of these maximum proportion values for each RCP. Monthly sea
   surface temperature anomalies were derived using a 1985–2000 maximum
   monthly mean climatology derived in the calculations for Figure 30-4 in
   Hoegh-Guldberg et al. (2014). This was done separately for HadISST1.1,
   the CMIP5 models, and each of the four RCPs, at each grid cell for
   every region. DHMs were then derived by adding up the monthly anomalies
   using a 4-month rolling sum. Figure SM30-3 presents past and future sea
   temperatures for the six major coral reef provinces under historic,
   un-forced (no anthropogenic forcing), RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios.

   et al., 2014).

   Considering cold-water coral ecosystems, at pre-industrial atmospheric
   CO[2] level, 9% of known cold-water coral ecosystems were in
   under-saturated water (Cao et al., 2014). Under emission scenario IS92a
   (atmospheric CO[2] concentration 713 ppm and temperature increase of
   about 2.4°C by 2100), an estimated 70% of cold-water corals could be in
   under-saturated water by the end of the century with some ecosystems
   experiencing under-saturation by 2020s (Guinotte et al., 2006; Turley
   et al., 2007). Even if mitigation efforts (e.g., through
   geoengineering) could reduce atmospheric CO[2] levels to pre-industrial
   by the end of the century, the lag in the recovery of deep ocean
   chemistry would result in longer-lasting threats to cold-water coral
   ecosystems (Cao et al., 2014).

Living with Change: Implications for People and Livelihoods

   Overall, the evidence presented above confirms earlier work
   (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Done et al., 2003; Donner et al., 2005; Frieler
   et al., 2012) and substantiates the serious concern regarding the
   vulnerability of carbonate coral reef systems to a rapidly changing
   world. Given the importance of coastal ecosystems such as warm-water
   coral reefs for hundreds of millions of humans (Burke et al., 2011;
   Hoegh-Guldberg, 2015), these changes are likely to have implications
   for people and livelihoods, as well as regional security in some
   instances. It is also clear that we must increase our understanding of
   the effects of warming and acidifying oceans on mesophotic and
   cold-water coral reefs. These coral reefs represent important stores of
   biodiversity as well as habitat for fish, many of which are
   commercially important. As the deep ocean warms, the aragonite
   saturation horizon shoals and dissolved oxygen declines, it will be
   important to understand how these ecosystems will be affected. It will
   also be important to get a better understanding of how environmental
   conditions differ in the case of mesophotic reefs and whether or not
   they have the potential to act as refugia for coral reef species from
   the greater environmental extremes of shallow regions (Bongaerts et
   al., 2010a, 2013, 2015).

   With regard to cold-water corals, management interventions are likely
   to be limited to regulating or banning fishing and mineral extraction
   in the locality of reefs (Thresher et al., 2011). The highest priority
   for these sensitive ecosystems is to locate and protect sites that are
   likely to be refugia areas (Thresher et al., 2015).

   The recent consensus of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
   (IPCC, 2014) identified a number of risks and vulnerabilities for coral
   reefs under rapid ocean warming and acidification, as well as exploring
   the ramifications and adaptation options (see Table 30.4 in
   Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014). Changes to the structure of ecosystems
   such as a loss of coral reefs, underpin a series of risks and
   vulnerabilities to fisheries production and consequently food and
   income security in tropical regions thus rates of unemployment and
   poverty. As coral reef ecosystems degrade or disappear, there is the
   risk that coastal fisheries production is reduced, decreasing food
   security and increasing unemployment. There is also a risk that the
   tourist appeal of tropical coastal assets may decrease as ecosystems
   take on less desirable states (i.e., from coral to seaweed domination),
   affecting the potential to attract tourist dollars. Reduced
   availability to food and income is likely to exacerbate coastal poverty
   in many equatorial countries. Strategies to reduce risks in both these
   cases involve strengthening integrated coastal zone management to
   reduce contributing stresses such as coastal pollution,
   overexploitation and physical damage to coastal resources.

   As outlined by Poloczanska et al. (2013, 2014, 2016), marine species
   are already redistributing toward higher latitudes. This has the
   potential to reorganize ecosystems including commercial fish stocks,
   drive changes to the distribution, and abundance of predators and prey,
   as well as increasing the risks of invasive species taking hold in new
   locations and ecosystems. Changes to the distribution of fish species
   in coral reef regions are expected as oceans warm (Cheung et al., 2010;
   Pörtner et al., 2014; García Molinos et al., 2015). This has the
   potential to change national income in either direction, depending on
   location, as important fisheries stocks redistribute, increasing the
   likelihood of disputes over national ownership of fisheries resources
   (Robinson J. et al., 2010). In this regard, key management actions to
   reduce risks include increased international cooperation over key
   fisheries as well as developing a better understanding of the linkages
   between ocean productivity, recruitment and fisheries stock levels
   (Bell et al., 2011). International cooperation on measures which enable
   sustainable fishing of these valuable stocks that take into account the
   influence of climate change across international boundaries, are
   important adaptation measures that need to be implemented as soon as
   possible (Robinson J. et al., 2010). Changing ecosystem structures in a
   warming and acidifying ocean is also likely to increase the risk of
   disease such as ciguatera and harmful algal blooms, with ramifications
   for human health and well-being. Strategies in this case involve
   increased monitoring and education surrounding key risks, plus the
   development of alternative fisheries and income for periods in which
   disease incident increases (Bell et al., 2013).

Conclusion: The Key Role of Climate Stabilization and Non-Climate Change
Factors

   A recurrent theme within this review is the fact that we are already
   seeing major and fundamental change occurring in the world's ocean in
   response to climate change and that the rate of change is largely
   outstripping the ability for coral reefs to adapt genetically or
   relocate. If greenhouse gas emissions are not mitigated, it is very
   clear that the ocean will be a vastly different place by the mid to
   late century (Gattuso et al., 2015). It is also clear that there are
   few or no adaptation strategies for humans to counter the risks of
   ocean warming and acidification at global scales. If they did exist,
   they would almost certainly be prohibitively expensive relative to the
   costs of developing solutions to the unprecedented rise of CO[2] in the
   earth's atmosphere.

   This leaves us with two clear options with respect to preserving
   invaluable ecosystems such as coral reefs. The first is to stabilize
   planetary temperature and CO[2] concentrations as quickly as possible.
   Only then will biological responses such as acclimation and genetic
   adaptation have any chance of operating. The second is to dramatically
   reduce local stresses which are currently acting on coral reefs and
   which are reducing their resilience to climate change. By reducing
   these non-climate stresses, coral reefs will have the opportunity to
   develop greater robustness or resilience to the challenges of a
   changing planet. However, if this is not combined with stabilization of
   temperatures and acidification then it is likely to only temporarily
   put off the inevitable. If we do these two things, there is a chance
   that conditions will stabilize on planet earth by mid-to-late century,
   ensuring that some of the spectacular coral reef ecosystems will be
   able to flourish across the world's tropical regions.

   Frontiers does not own the copyright in articles you submit to it – you
   (or your employer or funder) continue to own the copyright in your
   articles. See the section Licences (permissions) you grant as an
   authors and the Copyright Statement for more information.

12. Trademarks

   "Frontiers In" and "Loop" are registered trademarks of Frontiers Media
   SA.

Conditions for Submissions of Articles for Peer-Reviewed Publication

13. Submission

   If published, your article will in principle remain published
   permanently, with your personal details and those of your co-authors,
   as well as those of the reviewers and handling editors, on the
   Frontiers website, and stored in archives, in repositories and
   potentially in other places.

   When you submit an article to Frontiers, you promise that:
     * the article is not under consideration by any other journal; if it
       has been submitted for consideration elsewhere, it has been
       definitively rejected and is no longer being considered for
       publication
     * the article will not be submitted for publication elsewhere unless
       either published or rejected by Frontiers
     * you have the explicit consent of all co-authors to submit the
       article and to accept these conditions, including the granting of
       the CC-BY licence, on behalf of all co-authors
     * you have the authorisation of all copyright owners (which may
       include your employer or funder, and any owners of third-party
       graphics) to submit the article and to grant the CC-BY licence over
       the article
     * an article submitted to report original research is an original
       contribution, meaning it contains content that has not been
       previously published in its current form (except for manuscripts
       deposited as pre-prints in established community-validated
       pre-print services)
     * the article does not contain any non-attributed content from any
       existing source, including the authors’ own existing material
     * all contributors have been adequately acknowledged
     * the article and all authors meet the authorship criteria as
       outlined in the Author Guidelines
     * the article complies with all the rules on content
     * all findings have been verified in accordance with the highest
       scientific standards in the relevant field
     * all research involving regulated animals (i.e. all live vertebrates
       and higher invertebrates) has been conducted in accordance with
       relevant institutional and national guidelines, all applicable
       legislation and guidelines and accepted best practices, and the
       approval body has been identified in the article
     * research involving human subjects has been conducted in accordance
       with the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki, you
       have identified the approval body in the article and the article
       states clearly that informed written consent was obtained from all
       participants
     * the article clearly declares any financial, commercial or other
       relationships which may be considered to represent a potential
       conflict of interest
     * you have disclosed all relevant facts to Frontiers concerning the
       author(s), the article, the underlying research, any relevant
       third-party rights and any actual or potential conflicts of
       interest.

14. Acceptance and Rejection

   Acceptance is at Frontiers’ discretion in accordance with its rules and
   processes. Once accepted, an article will in principle be published; on
   rare occasions an issue causing rejection may arise or be discovered,
   in which case the article may be rejected despite having been
   previously accepted.

15. Publication

   There is no prior right to publication. Articles submitted will be
   subjected to ethical and technical checks and then to our rigorous and
   interactive peer-review process, which will require your cooperation.

   If the article is published, you will become liable to pay our article
   publication charge (APC), or to ensure that it is paid. Current APCs
   can be seen here.

   The Frontiers peer-review process is designed to ensure scientific
   rigour and does not check for the satisfaction of the other
   requirements.

16. Disclosure of inventions

   You must ensure that all patent applications have been filed prior to
   submission of your article.

17. Time for publication

   If Frontiers unjustifiably fails to publish an article within a
   reasonable period of its final acceptance and payment by the author,
   Frontiers shall refund the publication fee, to the exclusion of any
   other liability of Frontiers for such failure.

18. The Published Article

   Once published, an article can not be removed except by Frontiers’
   decision, taken in accordance with accepted retraction processes. The
   article is likely to be archived and referenced in a number of archives
   and repositories.

   The article will be published with the name(s) and affiliation(s) of
   the author(s) and the names of the reviewers who endorsed publication
   during the peer review, as well as that of the handling editor.

   Frontiers reserves the right to remove any content, and to retract
   peer-reviewed articles, which in its view breach any applicable terms
   of Frontiers and/or which in Frontiers’ view are inappropriate in any
   way. Such removal does not entitle the author to reimbursement of APC.

   Frontiers is not liable for the acts or statements of others.

19. Licences (Permissions) You Grant as an Author

   When you submit an article to Frontiers, you grant to Frontiers and to
   the world at large a permanent, non-cancellable, free-of-charge,
   worldwide licence (permission) to publish, display, store, copy and
   re-use that article – including any third-party materials – and to
   create derivative works from it. You can not terminate that licence.
   You must ensure that you have all necessary permissions from third
   parties. Ownership by the third party of the copyright can still be
   notified on the relevant materials, and attribution must be made in
   accordance with usual scholarly practices.

   The licence (permission) you grant over your article (including any
   third-party materials included in your article) is a Creative Commons
   attribution licence (known as a "CC-BY" licence). You can not terminate
   that licence.

   In summary, the CC-BY licence means that anyone may copy, re-publish
   and/or re-use your content, and create derivative works from it, for
   commercial or non-commercial purposes, without charge, but must clearly
   attribute the work to you and any co-authors, and they must cite
   Frontiers as the original publisher of that content. Complete
   information can be found here.

   You agree that as the Creative Commons organisation updates the CC-BY
   licence, the licence terms granted by you are automatically updated to
   the new version.

   Reproduction of all or part of an article is also subject to compliance
   with usual academic attribution practices, which must be scrupulously
   complied with in addition to the CC-BY requirements.

   You may not reproduce or publish any content in any forum (online or

26. Text and Data Mining

   Frontiers does not object to text and data mining of its website's
   public content for the legitimate purpose of enrichment of external
   collections of scientific literature. However, we may need to restrict
   this activity if it hinders the performance of our website and its
   services. If you encounter problems, please feel free to contact our
   technical support: support@frontiersin.org.

27. Availability. Viruses and Attacks. Bugs and Errors

   Frontiers endeavours, through active maintenance, to ensure that its
   websites remain available, bug-free and error-free, but the need for
   planned and emergency maintenance and the nature of software
   development mean that no absolute guarantee can be given. We will do
   what we can to give adequate warning of any planned downtime and to
   minimise unplanned downtime.

   We may from time to time withdraw services and replace them with
   others.

   You are strongly advised to keep back-ups of any content which you do
   not wish to lose.

   Frontiers adopts industry-standard measures to minimise the risk of
   attacks, viruses, other harmful code and hackers. Given that our
   platform exists to permit the contribution of content, and given the
   constant efforts of those with ill intent, we can not guarantee that
   the website, or links posted by users, will be free from third-party
   viruses and other malicious third-party software or that we will always
   be successful in preventing attacks from succeeding. We will continue
   in our efforts both to prevent such occurrences and to minimise their
   impact on us and on our users.

Final Provisions

28. Breach of Terms

   Breach of any of these terms by Frontiers or you would be a breach of

29. Amendment of Terms

   These terms, and other conditions and rules of Frontiers, will be

   manner(s) appearing most appropriate to Frontiers. This may include
   email and/or notification at login. For this reason you should visit
   our websites regularly to ensure you are informed of changes to Terms.
   Amendments take effect upon that communication being made available to
   you, whether or not you actually log in to receive the information.

   deliberate wrongdoing, or for any other matter for which, under any
   applicable law, liability can not be limited or excluded.

32. Deadline for Bringing Claims

   Any claim against Frontiers must be brought within one year of your
   becoming aware of the existence of that claim.

33. Failure to Enforce Rights

   Frontiers may choose not to enforce its rights in the event of a breach
   of these Terms. Such forbearance does not prevent Frontiers from
   enforcing that right in the future.

34. No Third-Party Rights

   No third party (except your co-authors on submission of an article)
   obtains any rights from your contract with Frontiers, which is personal
   to you.

35. Force Majeure

   Neither you nor Frontiers are / is liable for failure to fulfil
   obligations due to circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the
   affected party, but both you and Frontiers undertake to take all
   reasonable measures to limit the duration and effect of those
   circumstances and to find other ways of fulfilling your or its
   obligations.

36. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

   Your agreement with Frontiers, including these terms and all other
   matters referred to above, is governed exclusively by the laws of
   Switzerland. You and Frontiers agree to seek in good faith to resolve
   any disputes through good-faith discussion, negotiation and mediation
   before resorting to litigation. Any dispute not so resolved shall be
   subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Canton of
   Vaud, Switzerland. Frontiers does not accept any other jurisdiction
   unless otherwise explicitly agreed by it in writing. You will consent
   to any action by us taken to stop or prevent you from bringing an
   action in breach of this clause, and to indemnify us for our costs in
   bringing such an action.

Privacy Policy

   We have updated our Privacy Policy to ensure that you, our users and
   researchers around the world, have a clear view as to what personal
   data we have, how we use it and under what conditions we entrust it to
   our contractors; and also to clarify the choices you have. This also
   ensures we are in line with the latest laws on data protection.

   This Privacy Policy comes into effect on 25th May, 2018.

Why do we collect personal data?

   Frontiers has a mission – to make scientific and scholarly research
   open to all, as more than ever, science and technology are needed to
   engineer solutions to move us towards a sustainable society. To do this
   we seek to engage with the world’s research community and to serve each
   researcher as best we can. Being able to understand your research
   interests, speciality and publications helps us in this task.

   Our goal with this policy is to be as clear as possible. If you have
   any questions you are welcome to contact us at
   data.controller@frontiersin.org.

What personal data do we collect, and when do we collect it?

1. We collect data which you provide or authorise us to receive from third
parties

   Frontiers and its open research network, Loop, have one single
   registered user base and a unified registration.

   When you register with Frontiers or Loop, you provide us with certain
   information, which becomes part of your registered user profile with
   Frontiers. Some basic information is required for registration, and you
   may choose to provide additional personal information. We also ask you
   if you wish to link other, publicly-available, information about your
   professional activities – including articles published, awards received
   etc – to your profile.

   When registering, and any time after registration, you choose how much
   information you wish to provide, based on the privacy options available
   on the registration page and on your profile once registered.

   If you, as a registered user, undertake an activity with Frontiers,
   such as submitting, co-authoring or reviewing an article, or becoming
   an editor, your contributions will be linked to your user profile. This
   approach maximises impact for your professional achievements and
   credits you for your contributions.

   You may register with Frontiers via your Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter
   profile. We will store the name, profile picture and email address from
   that external profile. We do not ask that external party for any more
   information and we do not provide any information to the external party
   as part of that process. The external party will know that you are
   registering with Frontiers.

   You may respond to a promotion on another website by contacting us and
   expressing an interest in receiving communications or participating in
   a Frontiers initiative in your area of interest or expertise. We will
   retain the personal information you provide to us for this purpose.

   You can, if you wish, link your ORCiD profile with your Frontiers
   account. If you choose to do this we will add your ORCiD and your
   ORCiD-listed publications to your Frontiers profile.

   We may provide other linking services in the future to provide a better
   service to you.

2. We collect information when you visit our websites

   When you visit any page on the Frontiers websites, some technical
   information is automatically collected:
     * Geo-location data. We record (via IP addresses and time stamp) from
       where in the world you are accessing the article, research topic
       and profile pages on our websites. This does not identify any
       individual (unless you are a registered user and logged in) and
       allows us to consolidate this data to understand where readership
       is located, and to provide impact metrics services, such as for
       your article or research topic.
     * Log data. We record information, known as log data, including
       browser interaction data and other information that your device’s
       browser automatically sends to any website you visit. This log data
       includes your IP address, which browser you are using and its
       settings, the date and time of your request, and data on how you
       used our website, "cookie" data (we explain this below) and
       information about your device.
     * Device information. We collect information on the type of device
       you are using, its operating system, browser type and version and
       other information to enable us to ensure that our website operates
       properly with your device. This may include information unique to
       your device. The information your device sends to us depends on its
       manufacturer.
     * Website tracking and improvement data. We may log the manner in
       which visitors to our website navigate our website. This is done to
       improve the usability of our website and to track the success of
       our communications and promotions.
     * Browsing history of registered users on our websites. This enables
       us to understand better the interests of our registered users.
     * Third-party analytics. Please see the section below on Online
       Tracking concerning our use of Google Analytics and third-party web
       analytics.
     * Payment information. We or our relevant contractors may, depending
       on your choices, retain your payment information.

3. We collect information from public and subscription sources on the
research activities, publications and conference activities of researchers

   Frontiers collects publicly-available information and information from
   subscription services on researchers, both registered and
   non-registered. Only information relevant to professional research
   activities is collected, such as name, institutional affiliation,
   contact details, publications, academic activities and
   specialisation(s), editorships and awards.

   This enables us to provide researchers with high-quality publishing
   services, such as identifying the most suited expert reviewers for
   articles or building world-class editorial boards.

4. We collect information on your interactions with Frontiers and with others
on our platforms

Interactions with Frontiers

   We remember interactions of registered and non-registered users with
   Frontiers. This may include emails received from you, acceptance of
   terms and conditions, your visits to the website, submission of
   content, acceptance of reviewer or editor roles, participation in the
   review process, acceptances and rejections of articles, Frontiers
   surveys you may complete and any other interaction between you and
   Frontiers.

Online Tracking

     * Google Analytics. Frontiers uses Google Analytics, a web analytics
       service provided by Google. Google Analytics uses cookies (see the
       section below on cookies) to allow us to analyse your use of our
       website. The information generated by the cookie regarding your use
       of this website will, as a rule, be transmitted to and stored on a
       Google server in the US. Information sent by Frontiers to Google
       Analytics does not personally identify any resident of Switzerland,
       the EU or EEA. In exceptional cases your full IP address may be
       transmitted to a server of Google in the US and shortened there.
       Google will use this information on our behalf to analyse your use
       of our website, to compile reports on website activities and
       provide additional services relating to website use and internet
       use to the website operator. The IP address collected through
       Google Analytics from your browser will not be merged with any
       other data held by Google.
       You may also prevent Google from collecting and storing information
       in cookies, from storing information about your use of the website
       (including your IP address) and from processing such information by
       downloading and installing the browser plug-in available here.
       For more information about Google Analytics and privacy, please
       refer to the Google website.
     * Third-Party Web Analytics. We also use selected third-party web
       analytics services, also sometimes referred to as "pixels", with
       services such as Twitter, Google and Facebook. See the section on
       Advertising Networks below.

Network connections

   You may choose, via Loop, to connect with other researchers and
   registered users. Frontiers stores this information as part of its
   networking service. Your connections are visible to Frontiers and,
   unless you have opted not to make this public, to other users of Loop.
   This service enables you to be kept up to date with new publications in
   your areas of interest and to connect with colleagues.

What do we do with the information we collect?

   We use the information we collect to:
     * Provide services for you and to the research community, including
       creating and managing your account (for registered users),
       providing our publishing and networking services and providing
       relevant research-related news and information to you within your
       areas of expertise and interest
     * Invite you to participate in Frontiers activities, particularly to
       review relevant articles within your area of specialisation, to
       contribute to cutting-edge research topics, and possibly to join an
       editorial board or to meet at a conference. The information we
       collect about your professional activities enables us to ensure
       that only relevant invitations are sent to you
     * Identify and disambiguate. To ensure that, where the same name is
       shared by more than one person, we are dealing with the right
       person in the publishing operations of our business
     * Comply with your privacy and email choices
     * Understand the user experience of our website and our editorial
       processes, in order to improve our services, website and processes,
       and to imagine new services, so that your experience with Frontiers
       can be the best possible
     * Understand the geographical locations and institutional
       affiliations of our users
     * Inform you of Frontiers activities, events and opportunities
     * Answer your queries and provide you with support and service
     * Conduct surveys aimed at providing you with a better service.

   Advertising networks. We intend to participate in advertising networks
   administered by third parties, such as Google, Facebook, Twitter and
   LinkedIn. These networks allow us to target our promotions to you by
   using data matching, demographic data, your stated or inferred
   interests and your browsing activity on our website, which is tracked
   over time by automated means such as cookies, web server logs and web
   beacons. The networks use the information gathered to show you
   advertisements and promotions tailored to your interests and
   specialisation. The networks may also track your browsing on other
   websites which participate in the advertising network. We also track
   the effectiveness of our promotional and marketing activities via these
   networks. You may opt out of participation in these activities. Please
   see the section on Opting Out below.

   Cookies. Cookies are small pieces of text sent to your browser by a
   website you visit and from your browser back to the website. Frontiers
   uses cookies. Some cookies last only for the duration of your visit
   (these are called "session cookies"), while others remain on your
   computer until they expire or are deleted (known as "persistent
   cookies"). Some cookies are associated with your Frontiers account (and
   thus your personal information).

   Cookies do not themselves identify you, but we may link information
   identifying you (for example your IP address) to a cookie on your
   browser. We use cookies to:
     * Apply any preferences you may have indicated
     * Track your navigation of our website (without identifying you) so
       we can analyse the usability of our website and improve it, and so
       that we can understand your interests and thus only send you
       information relevant to you
     * Know if you are logged in when you move to another part of our
       website (for session management)
     * Keep you logged in from one session to the next, if you so choose
     * Secure your data when communicating with our website.

   All Frontiers cookies are used only in the frontiersin.org domain. We
   also use third-party analytics cookies such as Google and other
   third-party Analytics. For further information on this, please see the
   above sections on Google Analytics and Advertising Networks.

   You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings
   on your browser; however, if you do this, you may not be able to log in
   or use the full functionality of Frontiers’ websites.

   A list of the cookies which are transferred to our users’ browsers can
   be seen here.

Transferring your information

   Frontiers operates globally, and your information may be transferred to
   other Frontiers entities and to third-party contractors outside your
   home country. The privacy protections and the rights of authorities to
   access your information in these countries may not be the same as in
   your home country.

   When we transfer information outside the European Economic Area (EEA)
   or Switzerland we take additional measures. This includes having
   standard clauses approved by the European Commission and the Swiss data
   protection authority in our contracts with parties that receive
   information outside the EEA. We also rely on European Commission and
   Swiss government adequacy decisions about certain countries, as
   applicable, for data transfers to countries outside the EEA; this may
   include reliance on the EU-US privacy shield.

How and when we share information

   When you register, some basic information, such as your name and
   institutional affiliation, is made public on your Loop profile. You can
   choose whether to make any other registration or profile information
   public or not. Anyone, including non-registered users, can see the
   information you make public.

   When we publish an article of which you are an author, editor or
   reviewer, your name is published with the article. This is part of the
   Frontiers mission to improve peer-review through transparency and
   accountability, and to credit and acknowledge your contribution. Anyone
   can see your name in connection with that article. Your name and
   association with that article cannot be removed or deleted unless
   required by accepted scholarly publishing practice.

   We use subcontractors, with appropriate data protection measures, to
   perform some of our processes. These include typesetting and
   copy-editing of articles, and customer relationship management.

   We work with numerous public research repositories, scholarly databases
   and other organisations (such as CLOCKSS, Crossref, DOAB (Directory of
   Open-Access Books), DOAJ (Directory of Open-Access Journals), MedLine,
   OpenAire, PubMed, PubMed Central, Scopus and Web of Science and other
   reputable scholarly repositories), to archive research articles and/or
   their metadata, as well as databases to enable plagiarism checks such
   as iThenticate, which provides additional discoverability and a further
   guarantee of a permanent record of those articles; or to enable
   plagiarism checks to be handled efficiently. With some repositories
   only the metadata is provided, which includes information identifying
   the authors and reviewers of an article. You can find further
   information on third parties we work with here.

   Use of tracking and custom audience methods, described elsewhere in
   this privacy policy, involve sharing of information as described in
   those sections.

   We may be required to share information with law enforcement agencies.

   All data we collect, use and share is for the purpose of providing our
   services to you and to the research community.

How we protect your information

   Frontiers takes a variety of technical, physical, organisational and
   administrative measures to provide an appropriate level of protection
   for your information against accidental, unlawful or unauthorised
   access, loss, destruction, alteration, disclosure or use.

   We define access rights to information and we use technology to limit
   access to those who are authorised. We ensure that our servers have
   adequate security. We control physical access to our premises. We have
   in place, and we apply, an IT and data security policy. We work to
   ensure that our contractors have in place appropriate security measures
   and process data in accordance with applicable laws.

Choices you have about your information

   You have a number of choices concerning your personal information.

   If you are a registered user, you have a number of choices as to what
   information you provide and how much of that information is made
   public. You should review your personal information and your privacy
   settings regularly. To do that, please go to your profile settings.

   You can manage the settings on your browser to change whether it
   accepts cookies and which cookies it accepts; you can also manually
   delete cookies. Please see the instructions of your device or browser
   provider for how to do this.

   You have the right to:
     * be informed of the information we store concerning you. Our
       intention is to respond to any request for information within
       thirty days of the request
     * require that your information be corrected or deleted. If you are
       registered, you can update your registration information by logging
       in to your profile. Frontiers may consider it has an overriding
       need to retain all or some information in order to provide its
