WHO ARE WE?

   Relay42 Netherlands B.V., Meeuwenlaan 100, 1021JL, Amsterdam, the

WHAT KIND OF DATA DO WE COLLECT AND FOR WHICH PURPOSES?

   As a visitor to our website, you provide us with specific types of
   data, including personal data relating to you and which allows us to
   identify you directly or in combination with other data.

   Data collected through our website

   We process your personal data based on our legitimate interest to
   improve and evaluate our website and gain insight into its use.

   We also process data based on your consent when you fill in forms on
   our website or contact us directly. According to your choice, we may
   send you marketing communications (newsletters).

   We process your personal data based on your consent obtained by

   personalized ads via different channels. To see more about our cookies

   We process your data when you show interest in us (e.g. fill in a form,

   In case we observe you showed preference towards Relay42, data from all

   double checks whether the proposed contacts should be indeed contacted.
   Only when both checks are done, we contact you.

CONFIDENTIALITY & SECURITY

   We will not provide your personal data to any other party, unless this
   is necessary for the execution of an agreement or if we are legally
   obliged to do so.

   Thereby, we take appropriate security measures to limit and prevent

   channels, you can send us a request to see, adjust, transfer or delete
   this personal data. This request can be filed by sending an e-mail to
   privacy@relay42.com.

   Under applicable data protection law, you have the following rights:
     * Being informed on which personal data we have and what we are using
       it for;
     * Inspection of your personal data;

     * Request to delete personal data;
     * Revoke your consent;
     * Object to certain uses.

RETENTION PERIOD

   Your data will be stored in the European Union.

   We will not store your personal data longer than necessary in order to
   achieve the purposes described within this privacy notice provided that
   we are not legally obliged to do so.

   In order to do so, we take into account:
     * Did you opt in to receive content from us? In this case, we keep
       your data as long as needed to provide the content to you.
     * Are we subject to any legal obligations to keep the data?
     * How long it is necessary to keep the data in order to carry out our
       business?

NATIONAL SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY

   Of course we also, gladly, help you if you have any complaints about
   our processing of your personal data. It’s your right to lodge a
   complaint with the national supervisory authority responsible for the
   protection of your data. For the Netherlands, our home base, you can

   In this article, we’re catching up with Database Marketer Guido
   Noodelijk and Senior Digital Marketing Specialist Giovanni Zebeda to
   talk about the digital concept behind their latest national campaign.

WHAT OUR CUSTOMERS SAY

   Before we started working with the Relay42 platform, we sent most of
   our offers in bulk, all at once and via a single channel. Now that
   we’re working with Relay42, we can send tailored messages, advice and
   offers every day, and ensure they arrive at the precise moment when our
   customers are interested in an energy service.” Maroue Khazai Lead
   Marketing Automation, NBA team | Eneco READ CASE STUDY
   With Relay42 we can deliver on the promise of personalization at scale
   to become fully customer-centric. Personalization is the only way
   forward; and we see that our approach pays off. Compelling results
   confirm that we chose the right technology for our mission. Michiel

   We would like to consistently serve relevant communications to our
   customers in all communication channels. The Relay42 platform helps to

   When a contract expires, we don’t wait until it’s too late, but
   proactively offer a new contract. We then focus our resources on making
   a conversion happen, regardless of which channel the customer uses. Rob

   marketing approach: you have to carefully think about the ecosystem and
