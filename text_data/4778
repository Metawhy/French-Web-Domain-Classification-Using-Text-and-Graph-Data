About the conference


   The 2019 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) will
   be held at the InterContinental Budapest Hotel  in Budapest, Hungary on
   July 14-19, 2019. The conference is organized by the International
   Neural Network Society (INNS) in cooperation with the IEEE
   Computational Intelligence Society, and is the premier international
   meeting for researchers and other professionals in neural networks and
   related areas. It will feature invited plenary talks by world-renowned
   speakers in the areas of neural network theory and applications,
   computational neuroscience, robotics, and distrbuted intelligence. In
   addition to regular technical sessions with oral and poster
   presentations, the conference program will include special sessions,
   competitions, tutorials and workshops on topics of current interest.

   Visit Budapest:
   From the abundance of thermal springs to one of the largest Parliament
   buildings in the world, it’s no wonder Budapest is ranked one of the
   most beautiful cities in Europe, attracting over four million visitors
   each year. There are World War II memorials for history
   lovers, Hungarian delicacies for the foodies, and street music, folk
   dancing, and famous museums for those who enjoy the arts. Though
   convenient public transportation is offered throughout this capital
   city, its highlights are easily accessible by foot, allowing you to
   walk the cobblestone streets—or across the variety of picturesque
   bridges over the river Danube, joining Buda and Pest—and appreciate the
   rich culture.
