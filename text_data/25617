Client Testimonials

A few words from our valued clients

   Five Star nonprofit software

     Our organization has used DoJiggy for several social events
     requiring team registrations. It is easy to enter, update and report
     on the status of your event. In fact, I am starting another event
     using DoJiggy this week!

   — Kathy S. – Geophysical Society of Houston
   Five Stars

     The platform is easy to use and it was clear that DoJiggy was
     responding to feedback as they worked to streamline it even more. We
     couldn’t have been happier with our experience. In the end our
     school ended up with more proceeds from the fundraiser than any
     previous year.

   — DeSoto Trail Elementary School
   Five Stars

     I used this for our school’s Rock N Run fundraiser. It was critical
     for our success. The ease of uploading class lists, running reports
     and general website creation were awesome. From the user side, we
     received only praise. Thank you DoJiggy!

   — Lani H. – STM School

   Peer-to-Peer Fundraising - Use Nonprofit Software

Peer-to-Peer Fundraising – How It Works

   Peer-to-peer is a powerful method of fundraising that leverages
   supporters to fundraise on behalf of an organization. It’s also known
   as P2P (p2p) fundraising or crowdfunding. The power of a peer-to-peer
   fundraising campaign lies in your participants’ fundraising abilities.
   By tapping into their social network of friends and supporters, your
   organization is able to reach a much larger audience, therefore
   spreading greater awareness of your cause and often raising
   significantly more dollars than traditional fundraising campaigns.

   money and spreading the word about your organization, without high
