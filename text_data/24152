   Vegan Ramen, thewoksoflife.com Vegan Ramen, thewoksoflife.com

   When we bought our first house over twenty years ago and money was
   tight, we were always looking for good deals at the local supermarket.
   The Chicken leg quarters at $0.39/pound sounded pretty good. This
   oven-baked five spice chicken is an easy dinner we used to make on

   My earliest memory of grass jelly is from my Cantonese neighbor who

   Ah–Mou, a respectful way to address an elderly woman in Cantonese.  I
   still remember what she looked like, and the stainless steel plates of
   varying sizes that she used […]

   This summer, we found ourselves in Montauk for the first time in almost
   20 years (tried and failed to write that sentence without feeling

   Chinese Shaved Ice, or baobing, is something I’ve only seen made the
   right way in China.  On hot days in Beijing, when my parents and sister
   lived there for a 3-year stretch while I was in college, there was
   nothing better than a tower of fluffy, snow-like shaved ice with all
   the toppings. Sweet red adzuki beans […]

   Pork fried rice is probably one of the most popular Chinese take-out
   dishes out there. Anything involving rice and pork is likely to be a
   winner with a Chinese audience (or any audience that loves Chinese
   food). In my parents’ restaurant, we used to serve pork fried rice as a
   side dish accompanying many other […]
