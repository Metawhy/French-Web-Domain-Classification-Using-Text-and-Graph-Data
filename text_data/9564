Zephyr jacket
       The Zephyr is a classic suit jacket that is a little less formal
       than the Charles: it’s fluid (it’s interior components are lighter,
       especially at the shoulder and the chest), has a straight cut, can
       be worn unpaired as here or combined with Nathan pants, both in the
       same dark navy wool fabric. On the inside, there are two pockets

       less dressy as a piece and very easy to take care of (easily
       machine washable and doesn’t wrinkle easily). It is here presented
