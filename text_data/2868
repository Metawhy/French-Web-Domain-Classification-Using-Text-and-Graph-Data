   Apple Cinnamon Yogurt Pancakes
   Apple Cinnamon Yogurt Pancakes
   about a week ago

   Apple picking season has commenced. If you happen to have some freshly
   picked apples or snagged some seasonal apples from the farmers market,
   you may be looking for some ways to utilize your bounty. Enter the
   apple cinnamon yogurt pancakes - also full of protein and fiber. These
   pancakes come together easily and are just as tasty when made in
   advance. Just reheat or eat cold, and you have a quick and delicious
   back-to-school breakfast that is perfect for those busy frenetic
   mornings. If you really want to go the extra mile, consider topping the
   pancakes with an extra dollop of yogurt and some sautéd cinnamon
   apples. You or your back-to-schooler will be very grateful.
   pumpkin and hemp seed granola
   pumpkin and hemp seed granola
   about 3 weeks ago

   Granola is one of those foods that can start out with healthy
   intensions and then turn into a sugar loaded faux healthy meal or
   snack. The foundation is typically a wholesome one, but then it becomes
   adulterated with loads of sugar, oil, possibly some chocolate chips,
   and sugar coated dried fruit. This recipe for a healthy, "feel good"
   pumpkin and hemp seed granola, which is loaded with seeds, spices, some
   maple syrup, and fiber will leave you satisfied and satiated without
   the post sugar high slump.

   cold sesame tofu with rice noodles
   cold sesame tofu with rice noodles
   about a month ago

   There is a Cold Sesame Chicken recipe from the New York Times that I
   have gone back to quite a few times this summer. It is delicious, super
   simple, and perfect for make ahead meals. To adapt the recipe for a
   plant-forward crowd, I decided to swap in tofu for the main and serve
   it over brown rice noodles with crunchy marinated cucumbers, peanuts,
   and cilantro, resulting in a refreshing and easy summer meal.

   radicchio, endive, and arugula salad with spiced pistachios
   radicchio, endive, and arugula salad with spiced pistachios
   about 5 days ago

   Most Thanksgiving meals are full of decadent and heavy foods. Add some
   contrast to the mix with a colorful and zippy salad that comes together
   quickly and seamlessly. Punchy bitter greens and fennel cut through the
   sweet, buttery, and starchy sides of the holiday and create a respite
   for your tastebuds. Thanksgiving or not, this salad is a simple yet
   sophisticated addition to your salad repertoire.

   Thanksgiving is quickly approaching. Stumped about what to make? Here
   are 26 very veggie things to help make your planning a little easier.

   It is full on squash season. If you love squash as much as I do, that
   means you are likely buying them by the armload at your greenmarket or
   grocery store. I am a sucker for simply roasted squash tossed into a
   salad or blitzed into a soup. If the #bowllife is more your thing, then
   this veg-filled crunch fest is the perfect way to enjoy your
   nutrient-rich fall bounty.
   brussels sprouts and squash chopped salad
   brussels sprouts and squash chopped salad
   about a month ago

   The September 2018 issue of Bon Appetit Magazine features a chopped
   salad from San Francisco restaurant, Che Fico. The image alone sold me,
   but so did the layers of flavors from all the ingredients - honey
   roasted squash, seared brussels sprouts, bitter radicchio, marinated
   chickpeas, salty olives, and cheese all tossed with a peppy Italian
   dressing. The multi-step process to recreate this salad was definitely
   something I was not sold on. I love the idea of this hearty salad as a
   main, but don’t love the multiple steps required to make it. I set out
   to build a better version that did not take two plus hours, still
   tasted amazing, and shaved some of butter and the cheese from the
   original recipe.
