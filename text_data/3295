   [12-days-blog-hop-website-01.png]
   Welcome to the Twelve Days of Giveaways Blog Hop from Hip Kit Club!!!
   For the next 12 days on the Hip Kit Club Blog, there will be all kinds
   of free cut files, printables, and more! The blog hop begins on the 1st
   Dec until the 12th Dec & always originates from the HKC blog.
   Today I am using a cut file designed by ME! I don't make them often,
   but I love the way these ones came out! Lorilei also joined me today,
   so be sure to hop over to her blog, too!

   our 12 Days of Giveaways. Please download them & enjoy! Happy Holidays
   from all of us here at Hip Kit Club.
   I used the GORGEOUS November kit for my page today, cutting the
   branches from the green and blue patterned papers.
   [joy.jpg]
   I wanted to keep the design simple to highlight the branches and their
   color.
   [joy%2B1.jpg]
   I love the combining a plaid pattern with pine....it reminds me of
   woodsy/Adirondack theme!
   [joy%2B2.jpg]
   For journaling, I just used a few label stickers and layered them with
   some embellies.
   [joy%2B3.jpg]
   Finally, the car with the tree on the top was a perfect match for my
   theme.
   [joy%2B4.jpg]
   And be sure to hop over to Lorilei's page!
   You can watch how I created this page in my process video below, which
   is a part of my 'Tis the Season: 12 Days of Holiday Scrapping series.

   Welcome to the Twelve Days of Giveaways Blog Hop from Hip Kit Club!!!
   For the next 12 days on the Hip Kit Club Blog, there will be all kinds
   of free cut files, printables, and more! The blog hop begins on the 1st
   Dec until the 12th Dec & always originates from the HKC blog.
   Today I am using cut files by Jana Maiwald-McCarthy and Kim Watson!
   Jana is also sharing a page on her blog HERE.
   [HKC%2B1st%2BDec%2BTree%2Bcut%2Bfiles%2Bby%2BJana.jpg]

   Here is the page that I created with these gorgeous files and the
   amazing November Kits:
   [twinkle%2Bbright%2BHKC.jpg]
   For my project, I use ALL the trees in different sizes and patterns.
   [twinkle%2Bbright%2B1.jpg]
   I added some mixed media to the background,
   [twinkle%2Bbright%2B5.jpg]
   [twinkle%2Bbright%2B2.jpg]
   and used a bunch of circle shaped elements to mimic the look of
   ornaments.
   [twinkle%2Bbright%2B3.jpg]
   You can watch my entire process in the video below:

Clique Kits 2017 DT

   Welcome to the Clique Kits Blog Hop!
   [16865137_10208222451094232_1537020028769718653_n.jpg?oh=5b979d82972a19
   744a3954dbf8c10d8c&amp;oe=59737399]
   Today we are doing a blog hop to introduce all the new team members! I
   am so excited and honored to have been asked back for a 2nd term on the
   team!
   Before I share my page, here is a little "get to know me"
   questionnaire that all the team members are answering:
   1. What's your favorite color?  GREEN
   2. What's your favorite song right now? "My Name is Human" by the
   Highly Suspect

   IFRAME:
   https://www.youtube.com/embed/l5-gja10qkw?feature=player_embedded

   3. Who inspires you? People who stand up for themselves; strong women;
   people who take time to enjoy the little things; people doing good
   things for others. Scrappy wise, I just love to look through Pinterest
   and find layouts that speak to me....no particular artist, but I do
   love Paige Evans and Missy Whidden!
   4. Favorite Book? Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse
   5. Favortie Movie? LOTR Trilogy!
   6.Favorite snack? Ice Cream or anything Chocolate and Peanut Butter!
   7. What is your favorite food? SUSHI!
   8. Where would you like to visit someday? Hawaii or New Zealand
   9. Who got you into scrapbooking? I started scrapbooking kinda on my
   own at first, but then got into Close To My Heart thanks to Heather
   Leopard.  Then I discovered the online world of scrapbooking and I was
   hooked from there.
   10. How many years have you been scrapbooking?  About 12, but serious
   (ok, obsessed) for about 8-9 years
   11. Favorite Manufacturer?  I gotta say Crate Paper.  I just love
   everything they make!  But I love American Crafts and Pink Paislee,
   too!
   So now that you know a little about me, let me share my page with you!
   [awesome%2Bcuts.jpg]
   I began by pulling out a whole bunch of old Clique Kits kits from the
   past few months and randomly pulling papers and embellishments to match
   my photo.  I usually start a page with a plan (a sketch that I've made
   or cut file I want to use), but I went into this one with no plan at
   all!
   [awesome%2Bcuts%2B2.jpg]
   I painted with some gelatos on my background to give a nice bright
   yellow color. I did some stitching to highlight my shapes and added
   some mist splatters.
   [awesome%2Bcuts%2B3.jpg]
   I added some fussy cut paint streaks from a piece of patterned paper
   and some doilies that came from a pre-cut die cut sheet from Amy
   Tangerine.
   [awesome%2Bcuts%2B1.jpg]
   I layered my photo with some papers and lots of chipboard shapes from
   Crate Paper "Gather" collection.
   [awesome%2Bcuts%2B4.jpg]
   You can watch my whole process here, and I would love it if you would
   take a moment to subscribe to my YouTube channel!
