PETA Statement re Death of 26th Horse at Santa Anita

   ShareTweetDonate

   For Immediate Release:
   May 26, 2019

   Contact:
   David Perle 202-483-7382

   Arcadia, Calif. – Please see the following statement from PETA Senior
   Vice President Kathy Guillermo on the euthanasia announced today of
   Kochees, the 26^th horse to die at Santa Anita race track since
   December:

     Santa Anita and all California tracks must suspend racing until the
     ongoing investigation by the district attorney is complete and the
     new rules have been strengthened. Decreasing the number of broken
     bones is not enough. PETA and Social Compassion in Legislation are
     currently working with The Stronach Group and the California Horse
     Racing Board to enact new regulations and laws to stop all deaths.
     Nothing short of a zero-fatality rate is acceptable.

   PETA—whose motto reads, in part, that “animals are not ours to use for
   entertainment or abuse in any other way”—opposes speciesism, a
   human-supremacist view of the world. For more information, please visit
   PETA.org.

New Report Reveals Nearly 1,000 On-Track Horse Deaths in 2014 Alone

   PETA and Horseracing Wrongs Urge, 'Don't Bet on the Belmont'

   For Immediate Release:
   June 3, 2015

   Contact:
   Shakira Croce 202-483-7382

   Elmont, N.Y. – As this year’s Belmont Stakes approaches, racing
   watchdog group Horseracing Wrongs has compiled the first-ever yearlong
   report of horses who’ve died—including names, dates, and locations of
   deaths—on racetracks in the U.S. PETA is releasing the report, which
   reveals that at least 942 horses died on U.S. racetracks in 2014. Many
   of the horses died at Belmont Park—including Flashy in Pink, Ego
   Friendly, and Roses for Romney. And many others were just 1 year old,
   including Ruby Jo, Manchas Mojave, and Jazz And Corona. Countless more
   died later, off the track, from injuries sustained during races and
   other, often preventable, causes.

   Horseracing Wrongs’ Patrick Battuello examined stewards’ notes and race
   records and filed open-records requests in all racing states to find
   the name of each horse who died—but because Kentucky and California
   rejected the group’s requests, other states omitted training deaths
   from their documents, and these statistics do not include deaths of
   young horses in training or fatalities at under tack shows, the list of
   deaths is likely much longer. As the report also points out, “[W]hat
   the industry refers to as ‘non-racing’ fatalities—colic, laminitis,
   ‘found dead in stall’—have not been included. And, of course, this list
   says nothing of the thousands of recent ‘athletes’ who were bled-out
   and butchered in slaughterhouses.”

   As James Cromwell reveals in PETA’s horse-racing exposé, these deaths
   occur in part because fragile Thoroughbreds are drugged to enhance
   their performances and keep them running through pain, leaving them
   vulnerable to catastrophic injuries. And the deaths continue: At
   Belmont Park in the last week alone, Gabbole died on May 28 and Soul
   House died on May 30.

   “Every single one of the many hundreds of horses who died on U.S.
   racetracks last year was a living, feeling individual who had a name
   and felt every moment of an agonizing death,” says PETA Senior Vice
   President Kathy Guillermo. “PETA’s message to people who care about
   animals is simple: Don’t bet on the Belmont.”

New Report Reveals Nearly 1,000 On-Track Horse Deaths in 2014 Alone

   PETA and Horseracing Wrongs Urge, 'Don't Bet on the Belmont'

   For Immediate Release:
   June 3, 2015

   Shakira Croce 202-483-7382

   Elmont, N.Y. – As this year’s Belmont Stakes approaches, racing
   watchdog group Horseracing Wrongs has compiled the first-ever yearlong
   report of horses who’ve died—including names, dates, and locations of
   deaths—on racetracks in the U.S. PETA is releasing the report, which
   reveals that at least 942 horses died on U.S. racetracks in 2014. Many
   of the horses died at Belmont Park—including Flashy in Pink, Ego
   Friendly, and Roses for Romney. And many others were just 1 year old,
   including Ruby Jo, Manchas Mojave, and Jazz And Corona. Countless more
   died later, off the track, from injuries sustained during races and
   other, often preventable, causes.

   Horseracing Wrongs’ Patrick Battuello examined stewards’ notes and race
   records and filed open-records requests in all racing states to find
   the name of each horse who died—but because Kentucky and California
   rejected the group’s requests, other states omitted training deaths
   from their documents, and these statistics do not include deaths of
   young horses in training or fatalities at under tack shows, the list of
   deaths is likely much longer. As the report also points out, “[W]hat
   the industry refers to as ‘non-racing’ fatalities—colic, laminitis,
   ‘found dead in stall’—have not been included. And, of course, this list
   says nothing of the thousands of recent ‘athletes’ who were bled-out
   and butchered in slaughterhouses.”

   As James Cromwell reveals in PETA’s horse-racing exposé, these deaths
   occur in part because fragile Thoroughbreds are drugged to enhance
   their performances and keep them running through pain, leaving them
   vulnerable to catastrophic injuries. And the deaths continue: At
   Belmont Park in the last week alone, Gabbole died on May 28 and Soul
   House died on May 30.

   “Every single one of the many hundreds of horses who died on U.S.
   racetracks last year was a living, feeling individual who had a name
   and felt every moment of an agonizing death,” says PETA Senior Vice
   President Kathy Guillermo. “PETA’s message to people who care about
   animals is simple: Don’t bet on the Belmont.”

   “Almost all of us grew up eating meat, wearing leather, and going to
   circuses and zoos. We never considered the impact of these actions on
   the animals involved. For whatever reason, you are now asking the
   question: Why should animals have rights?” READ MORE
