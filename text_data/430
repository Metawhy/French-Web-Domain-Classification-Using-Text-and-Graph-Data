Spiderman Birthday Party

   September 27, 2019~ Etc., PARTY



   Spiderman birthday party Spiderman birthday party

   Learn how to throw this Spiderman party, keep reading below!

   All the links to the printables are at the bottom of this post.


   My son really wanted an at-home birthday party, even though I tried to
   push for an outside party like Nickel City where I don’t have to prep
   or clean up and just have to bring cake and some vegetables and fruit
   and the place serves pizza and drinks.

   So I hired my 10 year old daughter as my assistant as we went shopping
   together and she made the 3-D buildings and also the Spiderman! The
   spiderman she added was done at the very last minute, when I told her I
   felt like something was missing. Then she went and printed a black and
   white Spiderman and attached it to a white string and it was perfect! I
   would have never thought of that myself so I was so impressed with her
   creativity.

   We got most of the party supplies from Zurchers but all the links are
   at the bottom of this post.

   Using 3 black foam boards, I traced a cityscape with a pencil, then cut
   it with an exacto knife. For the buildings, we used the 12-pk. soda can
   boxes and covered it in paper, then added windows.

   We had to have a lot of fruit and vegetables for the Superheroes that
   came to our party!

   Bagel bite pizzas were a huge hit

   I made the black spider web for the centerpiece with black construction
   paper, using this tutorial

   We played 3 games for the Spiderman party. The first game was we set up
   a security system with red crepe paper streamers where each Superhero
   had to go through the “red lasers” without touching or breaking it.

   The second game was a “Spiderman web shooting fight” where each
   Superhero got a web shooter(silly string covered in Webshooter
   printables one | two) and had to fight each other. Team one got red,
   team two got the blue web shooters.

   The third game was a pinata, of course! As requested by my 6-year old
   because what kid doesn’t love a pinata?

   I made sure to mix in a lot of toys along with candy in the pinata.

   After the games, he opened all the presents. The kids love this part of
   the party as much as the birthday kid. The cutest part was when my
   son’s little crush asked him, “Why aren’t you opening my present?”,
   without skipping a beat my son said, “I am saving the best for last.” A
   smooth operator!

   spiderman party spiderman party

   Then we finished the party with his favorite cake, an Oreo ice-cream
   cake. His older sister has had this same cake for her birthday parties
   every year in the last 5 years and it’s his favorite too. Easy for me
   since I didn’t have to make it!


   Table decor:

   Red tassel banner/blue tassel banner (the tassels are pre-strung so I
   took the tassels off and combined both color tassels in one-string
   together)

   Red rock candy

   Cityscapes – I used 3 black foam boards and traced a cityscape with a
   pencil, then cut it using exacto knife

   Buildings – using 12-pk. soda can boxes, we covered it in paper and
   added windows

   Spiderman in action – printed a Spiderman in b/w and tied a white
   string to the top of the building

   Spiderman party package printables for water bottle wrappers, food
   labels and cupcake toppers(but they have a ton of other printables like
   banners, thank you tags, mini favor bags)

   Webshooter printables one | two

   Spider web printables one | two


   Pinata:

   Pinata from Zurchers

   Spiderman loot bags

   Spiderman yo-yo’s

   Spiderman mega mix party favors



   All the Spiderman decor, tablecloths, silly strings, tabelcloths,
   Spiderman utensils and plates, pinata toys and candy are
   from Zurchers. They have SO much more in store than what’s listed on
   the website, I love going into the store, they have so many cute stuff
   and it’s a one-stop-shop for all party things. Thank you to Zurcher’s
   for providing all the party supplies!
