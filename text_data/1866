AMOS-17 MISSION

   On Tuesday, August 6, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket successfully lifted off
      from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Air Force
   Station, Florida, carrying the AMOS-17 satellite for Spacecom. Liftoff
   occurred at 7:23 p.m. EDT, or 23:23 UTC, and the satellite was deployed
                   approximately 31 minutes after liftoff.

   This was the third and final flight for this particular Falcon 9 first
     stage, which previously supported the Telstar-19 VANTAGE mission in
           July 2018 and the Es’hail-2 mission in November 2018.

   You can watch a replay of the launch webcast below and learn more about
                        the mission in our press kit.
