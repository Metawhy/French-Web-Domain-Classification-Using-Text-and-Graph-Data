   Cadbiom (Computer Aided Design of BIOlogical Models) is a discrete
   modeling software system.

What is Cadbiom?

   Cadbiom is a free modeling software system (GPL licensed). Based on
   Guarded transition semantic, it gives a formal framework to help
   modeling of biological systems such as cell signaling network.

Who can use it?

   Cadbiom provides a user-friendly interface, making it as simply as
   possible, to use for biologists and computer scientists interested in
   biological systems modeling.

What can I do with Cadbiom?

   Cadbiom allows simulating rule-based models and properties checking.
   Simulating the model shows the evolution of the model during a finite
   number of steps. Model checking provides solutions to reach properties.

What kind of model do I need to use Cadbiom?

   You can either create you own model or import models already formalized
   using BioPAX language. Thanks to the module biopax2cadbiom, the
   translation from various databases or ontologies formalized in BioPAX
   is an automatic feature

   To create your own model, you need to describe the relationships
   (reaction) between nodes (gene, protein, complex). The reactions are
   described as transitions (translocation, transcription, complex
   association etc) from an origin node to a target node. The guard of the
   transition is composed a logical formula with nodes as variables and ∨,
   ∧ and ¬ as logical operator.

   You can also use Pathway Interaction Database (PID) as data source. The
   automatic translation of PID pathways toward Cadbiom formalism is a
   feature of this software (see user manual to get more information on
   the translation scheme).

How to install it?

   Cadbiom package is available on PyPI (Python Package Index), the
   official third-party software repository for Python language.
