Mooney Mite M-18x

   Posted in 3D Projects on May 5, 2010 by psiteo

   Hello,
   I still really busy with the child and work, but for the fun I start a
   new project again.

   Now I working on a single seat fast light airplane, the first mooney.
   A small engine in a small light airplane give low fuel rate and good
   flight airspeed.
   The original aircraft is make from wood & fabric, but I looking at the
   M-18x, a metal version off the Mite, it is a certified airplane and it
   get a more heavy empty weight (but I choose this one for something more
   Plane-Maker related).

   I start this plane some days ago, first I have  make the Plane-maker
   model with the help off 3 views object.

   I let the Plane-Maker work aside for a moment to work on the 3d model
   (in fact just wanted to have fun in blender, the Plane-Maker part can
   be frustrating sometime, specially for the Mooney Mite flaps/trim, that
   I am not sure to be able to remake, and the Mooney tail trim.
   The good point off the M-18x is that they remove the flaps/trim system
   for a more conventional one, that I will have less trouble to make in
   Plane-Maker, the M-18x use a separate trim & flaps system, like any
   other light airplane.

   Now I have make the external fuselage, and start to give it some
   detail,the wings with flaps & ailerons & gears doors, I have make the
   engine and just starting to work on the gears, for the gear I got
   trouble to found good pictures or drawing off the system, the tail is
   still a template and I got a lot of work to put on it.

   Here what that look like at this time
   The Mooney logo is a 3d object, if somebody need it, just ask for it.

   The airplane doesn’t fly good in X-Plane, but that something I will ask
   for help later on X-Plane forum, still need to get a good 3d object
   interior and panel for the flight tester.
   For the people wanted to see a more conventional version, like the
   M-18c or M-18l, the objects must be able to share the all version, I
   using the custom objects in Plane-Maker for the external part, and the
   cockpit object for the interior with the 3d panel (I planned a other
   interior in low poly for external view with pilot, and a more detailed
   interior for the 3d cockpit), that mean that you can easily take the
   fuselage and other external part on any other Mite version, and make a
   modification for the 3d cockpit to suit your need.
   (The sources files .blend will be available for anybody want to use it,
   whatever I planned to give the final 3d objects to some Blender web
   site offering free 3d model, but for the simulation X-Plane &
   Filghtgear, modification are welcome)

   Any X-Plane user a welcome to give a hand on that project, even take
   the project in hands, I get really busy so I don’t really use the sim
   and modeling for the fun in my free time.
   No release date planned, perhaps I will not finish it, if I get busy
   elsewhere, like a lot off other X-Plane projects I have on my HDD.

Tutorial request

   Posted in Site news on May 29, 2009 by psiteo

   Hello, my situation with the new house and my young son, is now more
   easier, that give me some time to work on tutorials, so if you are
   looking for something special, just ask on this topic.

   I will do my best to answer them 😉

   In the next days, I will finish the entry with WIP, put more image to
   make people found easily what I try to point, put more details on some
   basic installation for Marginal’s scripts for mac/win/linux, for
   exemple

   I have make some test for FSX 3d model convertion to X-Plane, but that
   will take me more time to be able to writte something.

   Don’t hesitate to comment the tutorial to help me complete them 🙂

Busy with child and new home

   Posted in Site news on March 29, 2009 by psiteo

   I am making a pause for a short time
   Got my son recently, and we are moving to a new home
   When I will have installed my stuff in my new home, I will follow my
   tutorial with the blender vs X-Plane Materials usage, and UV texture,
   how to transfer your FSx 3d model material on a png texture for X-Plane
   usage.

   For those reading this, thanks for your patience
   By having no comments, I will probably move the stuff to my registery
   web space, that will not have no way to exchange with me, but that will
   more easier for me to customize it like I want. 🙂

BLender 248a for Ubuntu

   Posted in Blender, Tutorials on February 27, 2009 by psiteo

   I recently came to the world of Ubuntu,
   that a really nice system, that you learn to love easily.

   One thing that bug me, is that the blender version available from the
   add/remove software, is outdated.

   I have try to download the file directly at the blender official web
   site, and use it like I was doing on windows with blender beta, but I
   was looking for a more easier way to get it.

   I make a search on Google to found a blender 248a deb package for
   Ubuntu
   http://www.getdeb.net/release/3467

   Now you can add a personal icon for the .blend file, locate your icon
   folder your using,
   Mine is  /usr/share/icons/hydroxygen/128×128/mimetypes
   Create a new icon and call it gnome-mime-application-x-blender.png

   Make blender launch with the terminal open, to be able to see the error
   message
   Create a new launcher, in the properties change type for Application in
   terminal.

Various helicopters projects

   Posted in 3D Projects on February 26, 2009 by psiteo

   Here a list off some projects I have started, some is news projects,
   and some is just 3d add on for existing model make by somebody else

   So here the list off the projects show in the picture:
     * Robinson R22 – Simple 3d add on, for the X-Plane built in R22
     * Robinson R44 – 3d add on for the model recently published on the
       x-plane.org
     * Ak1-3 – Complete new project
     * Mosquito XEL – Complete new project
     * Winner B150 & T150 – Complete new project
     * Eurocopter Ec-130 – Complete new project
     * Eurocopter As-350 ba (A-Star) – Complete new project
     * Bell Jetranger bh06-b3 – Simple 3d add on, for the X-Plane built in
       Jetranger

   All the project called new, is in fact older project that I forget on
   my HD, they are all freeware project.

   I have no project to finish one in particulary, and no date limits.
   Do not ask me to send you a project, too much people have asked that, I
   send them my stuff, and once they receive it, no more life sign from
   them (from the village irritant to the old timer user), that not what I
   looking for, sorry.

   But I can tell you that two off them are on my next todo list, the
   Jetranger and the R22 and after the Eurocopter will follow

WIP Blender themes, interface & icons

   Posted in Blender, Tutorials on February 26, 2009 by psiteo

   Tired off your blender grey look?
   Want news icons for enhance your blender interface?

   All that can be make easily, you can build your proper themes or use a
   existant one.
   Here a list for themes:
     * graphicall.org
     * yorik.orgfree.com

   Here a list for Icon:
     * blenderartists.org

   Remember you will have to save your user preference to keep the theme &
   icon for next blender scene.

   I will soon post a archive with my personal blender interface, that
   will contain a interface with multiple windows layout, what I think
   more optimised for a X-Plane user, I working on a custom icon set to
   help user to indentify the tools that is needed to work with X-Plane

   Here a little preview I’ve posted a long time ago : interface test

WIP Blender X-Plane scripts

   Posted in Blender, Tutorials on February 26, 2009 by psiteo

   Blender don’t came with X-Plane scripts by default

   One big mistake people making at begin, is to associate the wavefront
   .obj format to the X-Plane .obj, by default blender came with a
   wavefront script for import/export, where we can see the .obj format,
   X-Plane can not use this file, but beginner will see .obj so they will
   use it.

   You need to manually install the Marginal’s python script to be able to
   have new entry in the blender export/import dialog box
   Here a picture showing the new entry in the dialog box with the script
   correctly installed

   This scripts can be found on Marginal’s web site, make sure you meet
   the blender version asked, later version will work with the script,
   older will not.
   You will need (if you haven’t get it) the python 2.5, that you can
   found here, caution the last python version can not work for some
   stuff, be sure to grab the 2.5, you can have multiple python version
   installed in the same time, on my computer I got python 2.5 + 2.6 + 3.0
   in my c: folder

   How to install the scripts?
   Simple expand the archive that you have downloaded at Marginal’s web
   site, you will have some file here that is important to install.
   Find the files with .py extension, that’s the scripts, but be sure to
   take the DataRefs.txt & XPlane2Blender.html also, the script need the
   dataref.txt, and you will need the help read me from Marginal

   You’ve got three ways to install the scripts for blender can use them:
    1. Use Marginal’s install.command, personaly I never use it, so I
       don’t know nothing about this way,but it must be the more easier
    2. Locate manually the blender’s .script folder, and put all the file
       inside this folder with all the other .py scripts
       For that, you need to found the .blender folder on your hard drive,
       depend off the os, you will found it easily, in Windows, at the
       blender installation, you have been asked to choose where this
       folder will be created, probably in the blender foundation folder
       in the program file, in Ubuntu in your home folder, but is hidden,
       tape ALT+H to show hidden files
    3. Use a custom path showing blender where to look for additional
       scripts, that the one I use, and I recommend.
       Here a picture showing you where to find this blender preference
       panel
       You just have to drag the top windows header down, to access the
       blender preference pane, click on the “File path” tab, and look for
       the “Python scripts:” field
       Show it with the windows explorer where you have put your personal
       blender script folder, mine I call it “Blender_scripts” and it’s
       located inside My Documents folder (Windows XP show in the picture)
       But one thing really important, is that you have to save the
       blender preference now, otherwise the next time you open blender,
       it will lost the path for the script folder, so simply save your
       user preference, use the shortcut CTRL+U or use the normal command
       show in the picture
       But remember that when you save the user preference, all what is on
       the 3d layers (objects, mesh, lights, camera, materials) will be
       saved.
       So before saving your user preference, open a new blender empty
       scene by using CTRL+X, and now go in the preference to set the
       python scripts file path, and save your user preference.
       Next time you will open a new blender scene or a older .blend file,
       this preference will be available.
