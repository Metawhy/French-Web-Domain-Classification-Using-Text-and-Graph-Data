Elf On The Shelf

   This year, we decided to start the Elf On The Shelf tradition in our
   home. Even though Graysen is only a little over 18 months, he
   understands so much and it will be fun for him to find his elf each
   morning. We adopted our elf on Saturday and named him Jingle
   McKringleberry. {My husband named him! It is fun to say, though!} He
   will make his appearance at our house the day after Thanksgiving. We
   want to do our Elf tradition a little different than the original Elf
   On The Shelf tradition. In the story that comes with the elf, it says
   that the children are not able to touch their elf or the Christmas
   Magic may run out. At our house, we #1. want to avoid as many tantrums
   as possible from wanting to touch him and not being able to #2. make it
   more about the Christmas Spirit, grace and forgiveness and #3. we want
   him to love his elf, hug him, talk to him and not be afraid of him. We
   also don't want to necessarily describe Santa as an old man that wears
   a red suit {he was a real man once, who wore a green suit}, but more of
   a spirit or presence that lives inside us all. We want to focus more on
   the true meaning of Christmas and the joy that it brings to others.
   When he asks about the man in the red suit, we will assure him that
   yes, there is a Santa, but like God, some people have a hard time
   believing in something they can't see, so they made up a character to
   fill that void. I as a child, did not believe in the Santa who rode in
   the sleigh for very long, but I still to this day believe in the Spirit
   of Christmas and it's my favorite time of year! I could live in the
   snow globe of a Christmas Village, with carols being played on the
   streets, all year long!
   With that being said, we will be introducing Jingle on Friday and like
   we explained in the letter, he will be here until Christmas Eve
   watching over Graysen. We explained that Graysen will have to help
   teach Jingle manners, because elves tend to be mischievous, just like
   him. But...Santa, just like Jesus and Mommy and Daddy, forgive him,
   because everyone, including Santa makes mistakes. Here is a picture of
   Jingle. I cannot wait to post the fun antics that he gets into. Also
   below is the letter that he will be bringing with snow covered donuts
   on Friday.

Pumpkin Patch

   Last weekend, we ventured out to the pumpkin patch on what was, I'm
   afraid, the LAST nice day of the season. It turned out to be a gorgeous
   fall day, thankfully! We have an amazing pumpkin patch near our house
   that is also a greenhouse, landscaping company and bakery. Their
   cupcakes are to die for! Don't even get me started on the "Down on the
   Farm" cupcakes! {vanilla cupcakes with maple buttercream and candied
   bacon on top} They were out of those when we were there, but we can't
   leave without one or TWELVE of them! YES...12!!! I was planning on just
   getting a mix six of them, but Tim didn't think he would like any of
   the ones I chose, so he got his own mix six! Needless to say, there are
   only 2 left a week later!
   [pinters+cupcakes.jpg]
   They had a fabulous Corn Box. Graysen threw a huge shit fit when we had
   to get out. It's so awesome. I am seriously trying to figure out how to
   make one at our house. It is so much better than sand! There is no
   mess! The only thing we'd have to worry about is keeping squirrels and
   mice out. I think a cover would do the trick! He had so much fun
   scooping it and dumping it on his legs to bury them.
   [corn+box.jpg]
    We went with a good friend of ours and her son, who is 6 weeks older
   than Graysen. It was so fun this year, because the boys could actually
   do the activities there and really enjoy it!  They have animals that
   you can feed and watch, {The boys really liked the chickens.}, a
   ginormous jumping pillow {They are still a little too small for that.},
   pumpkin chucking, a huge corn maze, hay rides, "musical" pots to bang
   on, kettle corn, tricycle races, tires to climb on...the list goes on!
   [chickens.jpg]
   How sweet is this photo??
   [boys+at+the+pumpkin+patch.jpg]
    They also have slides made out of jumbo, corrugated tubes. All of the
   kids were wizzing down to the runway landing at the bottom. Graysen
   wanted to go, so Tim took him to the top and let him go...
   He just sat there. His pants were wet from dumping his water out into
   his lap in the car so he was stuck in the tunnel. It literally took him
   over 2 minutes to inch his way down the tube. It was quite comical.
   When he got to the bottom, he was ready to go again! Needless to say,
   we went on to something else so that they other kids could actually
   have a turn this season!
   [stuck+in+the+slide.jpg] [end+of+slide.jpg]
    This is the best we could do for a family photo this year. Graysen was
   not going to sit still for anything! There were too many pumpkins to
   chuck, animals to feed and corn to shovel!
   What a fabulous weekend it was though! It was the last nice day of the
   season I'm afraid! It was 32* and sleeting this morning! I'm so not
   ready for winter!

    Happy Fall!

Cheap Entertainment: Household Items Turned Toys

   I don't know why we buy any toys! Actually, it's others that buy us the
   toys...but either way...my son only wants to play with household items
   like remotes, bottles etc. I thought I'd post a mini series called
   "Cheap Entertainment" to show some of the creative ways we entertain
   our one and a half year old. Right after school got out last year, we
   redid our guest room/craft room {Junk Room} and turned it into an
   amazing toy room! Graysen does love it, but the toys in there do not
   get played with as much as some other random things we find around the
   house. Here are some examples of the things we've done lately to
   entertain Graysen.
   Fine motor is extremely important for little ones' development. I kept
   telling Tim that we need to get some lacing cards for Graysen and then
   it hit me...make my own! Duh! I cut Cookie Monster out of a cereal box
   so that it was sturdyish cardboard and then just punched holes around
   his head. I took an old shoelace out of a shoe that Tim never wears and
   Voila! Lacing Card!
   [cereal+box+lacing.jpg]
    While getting supper ready one night, all Graysen wanted to do what
   pull everything out of the cupboard. I saw the empty spaghetti holder
   sitting on the counter, so I grabbed a handful of skinny straws that we
   had in the cupboard. (We always have a MILLION straws at our house.)
   There are two different sized holes in the top of the spaghetti holder
   to measure one serving or two, so he had a blast sticking the straws in
   and then shaking them out.
   [straws+and+spaghetti.jpg]
    Another game that turned into being absolutely pure genius, was a game
   that involved paper cups (we happened to have a sleeve of Sesame Street
   ones in the cupboard), a muffin tin and the umpteen hundred tennis
   balls we have around the house. First, the game started by me stacking
   cups for Graysen to knock over. He then stacked them, unstacked them,
   etc. The dog brought one of his mini balls over to play and Graysen
   stuck it under a cup. Shadow hit all the cups over until he found the
   ball. A new game was born that stimulated both of their minds! I then
   brought out a muffin tin and we put the cups and balls in the holes. We
   tried to throw the mini balls into the cups, hid treats under the balls
   for Shadow and had a blast mixing and matching the items in the cups.
   These simple things entertained him for SO LONG! I should have been
   productive during that time, but it was too much fun to watch him learn
   and explore!
   [muffin+tin.jpg]
   Game On!

Learning Through Movement: Sight Word Hop Scotch

   I saw a post on Pinterest, where someone had taped sight words to the
   floor in a hop scotch pattern. I instantly remembered how I used dry
   erase crayons to number the tile floor where they should line up last
   year. Instead of taping pieces of paper to the floor, I used dry erase
   crayons to drew a hop scotch pattern and then filled it with sight
   words and decodable words for my First Grade Tile 1 students. The
   Second and Third graders were jealous and wanted to do it too. I think
   I'll be making a second one with their sight words and possibly math
   facts! The kids love seeing if they can do it faster than they did
   yesterday. (fluency builder) The crayon comes right off with a little
   bit of rubbing and a tennis ball on the end of a broom handle takes it
   off really fast!

   Happy Hopping!

Painting Class

   [blogger-image-1501093340.jpg]
   Yesterday my friend and I took an incredibly fun furniture painting
   class. We learned three different techniques. Distressed, Color Wash
   and Two Tone. I love distressing so I did it to all three sample
   boards. This picture is before the distressing. I chose a minty teal as
   my color to work with and Cassie chose coral.
   [blogger-image-498076450.jpg]
   We each brought a picture frame to paint as a mini project. My frame
   was black to start with and had goldenrod stars on it. (super country)
   I did nothing to it before painting it because it didn't really have a
   finish. I like how the black came out when I distressed it. I used my
   mint as a base then some emerald and coral accents. I love how it
   turned out! I can't wait to paint everything in our house! What an
   amazing DIY day that started with a painting class and ended with an
   auction. Check out the awesome accent moldings I scored. Those will be
   made over soon!

Easy DIY Crate Seats

   Today I finally got around to putting my crate seats together for my
   classroom. They were even easier than I had anticipated. They are all
   over Pinterest right now and so they should be! They are super easy,
   super cute, super functional seating for your classroom, playroom or
   any kid space!
   [crate+seats.jpg]
   Here's what you'll need:
   Crates - I used these from Target.
   I made 8 of them for my classroom @ $3 = $24
   Fabric  - I used this fabric as well as other patterns from Hobby Lobby
   I bought 5 yards because I wanted to use it for something else too. I
   probably used a little over 2 yards total @ [DEL: $6.99 :DEL]  $4.99 a
   yard on sale = $10
   Foam - I used a roll of upholstery foam, but a cheap foam mattress
   topper would work just fine, especially if you are making a lot. My
   foam roll was just enough to make 8 seats = $12
   Wood - Lowes has PlyWood anywhere from $10-$40 for a 4' x 8' sheet and
   they cut it for FREE!
   My board was $16 and I only used 1/2 of it, which actually got my 12
   pieces = $8
   Duct Tape - Lowes had colored Duct Tape for like $2 a roll and I barely
   used any.
   The total of this project was right around $55 for 8 seats.
   1. Lay the wood piece on top of the foam and cut the foam the same size
   or slightly smaller than the board.
   2. Lay the fabric out on the floor wrong side up. (Be sure that your
   pattern is going in the direction you want it to when you lay your foam
   and wood on top.)
   3. Lay foam down and then the board on top of that.
   4. Cut your fabric about 3 inches larger on all sides so that you have
   some to wrap around.
   5. Wrap the fabric, pulling tight, but not too taught so that it
   distorts the pattern and tape it to the back of the wood like you would
   when wrapping a package. I did the two long sides first and then the
   ends so that it made nice corners.
   6. I don't have this yet, but I plan on adding a ribbon, or possibly
   loop made out of the fabric, to each one so they pull out of the crate
   easily.
   It would have probably taken me right around an hour to put all 8
   together, but I had a small "helper" at school with me today. I'm
   pretty sure my room was a son of a MESS when he got done! He basically
   took everything off the shelves and threw them all over the
   room! Here's a picture of Graysen's "productive" day as well! Needless
   to say, he passed out in the car on the way home, refused to lay in his
   crib when we got home, slept on me for a little while on the couch and
   refused to wake up for anything, which left him wearing ginormous
   crabby pants!
   His shirt fits today I guess, "Back off! I'm crabby!"

2013 Classroom Preview

   Ok...so I know July is not over yet, but I have Summer School starting
   on Monday and my classroom had to be transformed from a Kindergarten
   Room to a Title 1 Resource Room. For the last five years, I have taught
   Kindergarten and am now embarking a new and exciting journey of being a
   Title 1 Teacher. I will have small groups of 1-4 students off and on
   all day as well as other testing, grant writing and paperwork duties
   and such. I wanted to do a total overhaul on my classroom since it will
   need to suit 1st graders, 2nd graders and 3rd graders. Our school
   colors at black, silver and teal, but I wanted it a little more fun
   than just school colors, so I decided to add a punch of lime! My
   classroom is not quite finished, but I thought I'd give you a sneak
   peak as to what has been going on in the chaos that is my classroom
   right now...
   These are the fabrics that first inspired me!
   I fell in love in the Fabric Section of Hobby Lobby! I plan on making
   them into padded seats for a bunch of crates that I have.
   [classroom+2.jpg]
   A quick {never cheap} trip to the school supply store left me with this
   wonderful loot! I get excited just looking at it! That jar has these
   really cool class rocks that have one flat side (floral section with
   the other glass jewels) that I'm going to be turning into coordinating
   magnets for my white board with heave duty magnets (also found at Hobby
   Lobby) and E6000 Glue.
   [classroom+4.jpg]
   Here is my [DEL: helper :DEL]  supervisor for one of my work days!
   Needless to say...I didn't get very much work done that day! Good thing
   Mommy has a lot of manipulatives to keep little hands busy! That
   monster border was fun for a few years and the Kindergartners loved it,
   but it's time for something fresh and new!
   [classroom+5.jpg]
   That flower is also going to be turned into a magnet. I have a pair of
   the them that I found at Hobby Lobby as well and they match the fabric
   I bought! LOVE! One of my other favorite things is that bamboo print in
   the middle. It's fadeless paper with a bamboo pattern on it. I got that
   at the ABC Toy Zone. It was the perfect backdrop for my Boggle Board!
   [classroom+6.jpg]
   Here is a picture of the Boggle/Reading Corner and the crates that I'm
   going to be making seats for. The monster border is now gone and the
   bottom half of the black is covered with the bamboo paper. (I use black
   plastic for bulletin board backgrounds because it doesn't fade and
   holds up pretty well.) Those shelves in the bottom left picture hold
   our small group reading games and the Add It Up board has been
   revamped. That small black table will also be a small group activity
   center for summer school and possibly during the school year as well.
   [classroom3.jpg]
   Here's a picture of the little bit of help I got while Graysen came to
   work with me!
   [classroom+7.jpg]
   This is a close up of each section on my giant bulletin board wall.
   (It's a "fake" partition wall that could be opened up to make one big
   classroom with the room next door, but we just use it as a big bulletin
   board.) Check out my post here to see how I made that ribbon border out
   of butcher paper.
   [classroom+10.jpg]
   Here is a shot of the back wall almost complete. The rest of the room
   is not quite done, but as soon as I finish, I will post final pictures
   of the room complete.
