   We categorise calls by type (debt collection, serious number,
   sweepstakes, etc.) and give the number in question a tellows score,
   which indicates whether a number is trustworthy or suspicious, helping
   you to decide whether or not to take the call.

   We've all had to deal with the same thing. As your phone rings from
   dawn till dusk and nuisance calls bask in a sun of trickery, it is the
   spammer and scammer that will rule the day, but nay we say!!!
   au.tellows.org intents to disrupt the fraudster line of success by
   distributing important information on all sorts of unsolicited calls.
   If you receive a call from an unknown number, just access the tellows
   database and find details on the numbers point of origin and the nature
   of the call. The people's ignorance is the scammer most effective
   advantage. Once you know who you are facing, you will also know the way
   to counteract their malevolent attempts appropriately. At this, the
   number's tellows score will tell you whether caller is reliable or
   dubious. The higher the score the higher the risk. Learn more on

Where does the information on telephone numbers come from?

   The main indicator of a number's trustworthiness, the tellows-score, is
   the result of a complex algorithm that is fed by your comments and
   ratings on numbers. Your participation is the key to successfully
   counteract future spam and scam attempts since the callee knows who he
   or she is dealing with prior to answering the phone. Share your
   knowledge on the trickery of dubious entrepreneurs and help to deny
   them their unlawful treasure.
