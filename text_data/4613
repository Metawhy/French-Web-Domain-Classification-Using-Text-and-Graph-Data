   The world wastes more than 1.3 billion tonnes of food each year. The
   planet’s 1 billion hungry people could be fed on less than a quarter of
   the food wasted in the US and Europe.
   Image: UN FAO

   In a recent report, the World Economic Forum identified cutting food
   waste by up to 20 million tonnes as one of 12 measures that could help
   transform global food systems by 2030.

   Now South Korea is taking a lead, recycling 95% of its food waste.

       waste

   It wasn’t always this way in the country. The mouth-watering array of
   side dishes that accompany a traditional South Korean meal - called
   banchan - are often left unfinished, contributing to one of the world’s
   highest rates of food wastage. South Koreans each generate more than
   130 kg of food waste each year.

   By comparison, per capita food waste in Europe and North America is 95
   to 115 kg a year, according to the Food and Agricultural Organization
   of the United Nations. But the South Korean government has taken
   radical action to ensure that the mountain of wasted food is recycled.

   As far back as 2005, dumping food in landfill was banned, and in 2013
   the government introduced compulsory food waste recycling using special
   biodegradable bags. An average four-person family pays $6 a month for
   the bags, a fee that helps encourage home composting.

   The bag charges also meet 60% of the cost of running the scheme, which
   has increased the amount of food waste recycled from 2% in 1995 to 95%
   today. The government has approved the use of recycled food waste as
   fertilizer, although some becomes animal feed.

   Smart bins

   Technology has played a leading part in the success of the scheme. In
   the country’s capital, Seoul, 6,000 automated bins equipped with scales
   and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) weigh food waste as it is
   deposited and charge residents using an ID card. The pay-as-you-recycle
   machines have reduced food waste in the city by 47,000 tonnes in six
   years, according to city officials.

   Residents are urged to reduce the weight of the waste they deposit by
   removing moisture first. Not only does this cut the charges they pay -
   food waste is around 80% moisture - but it also saved the city $8.4
   million in collection charges over the same period.

   Waste collected using the biodegradable bag scheme is squeezed at the
   processing plant to remove moisture, which is used to create biogas and
   bio oil. Dry waste is turned into fertiliser that is, in turn, helping
   to drive the country’s burgeoning urban farm movement.

   Urban farms

   The number of urban farms or community gardens in Seoul has increased
   sixfold in the past seven years. They now total 170 hectares - roughly
   the size of 240 football fields. Most are sandwiched between apartment
   blocks or on top of schools and municipal buildings. One is even
   located in the basement of an apartment block. It is used to grow
   mushrooms.

   The city government provides between 80% and 100% of the start-up
   costs. As well as providing food, proponents of the scheme say urban
   farms bring people together as a community in areas where residents are
   often isolated from one another. The city authorities are planning to
   install food waste composters to support urban farms.

   Which brings us back to banchan. In the long term, some people argue
   South Koreans will need to change their eating habits if they are
   really going to make a dent in their food waste.

   Kim Mi-hwa, chair of the Korea Zero Waste Movement Network, told
   Huffington Post: “There’s a limit to how much food waste fertilizer can
   actually be used. This means there has to be a change in our dining
   habits, such as shifting to a one-plate culinary culture like other
   countries, or at least reducing the amount of banchan that we lay out.”

Five Million Jobs by 2020: the Real Challenge of the Fourth Industrial
Revolution

   · The Fourth Industrial Revolution, combined with other socio-economic
   and demographic changes, will transform labour markets in the next five
   years, leading to a net loss of over 5 million jobs in 15 major
   developed and emerging economies

   · Skills and jobs displacement will affect every industry and
   geographical region, but losses can be offset by job growth in key
   areas

   · A clear majority of businesses believe that investing in skills,
   rather than hiring more short-term or virtual workers, is the key to
   successfully managing disruptions to the labour market for the long
   term

   · The new research by the World Economic Forum is the first of its
   kind, representing more than 13 million employees in nine industry
   sectors and 15 economies; it aims to guide business and policy-makers
   on how to equip labour forces with the skills to navigate the
   disruption of the Fourth Industrial Revolution

   · Access the full report, infographics and more here. For more
   information about the Annual Meeting 2016, visit www.weforum.org

   Geneva, Switzerland, 18 January 2016 – The Fourth Industrial
   Revolution, which includes developments in previously disjointed fields
   such as artificial intelligence and machine-learning, robotics,
   nanotechnology, 3-D printing, and genetics and biotechnology, will
   cause widespread disruption not only to business models but also to
   labour markets over the next five years, with enormous change predicted
   in the skill sets needed to thrive in the new landscape. This is the
   finding of a new report, The Future of Jobs, published today by the
   World Economic Forum.

   The report is based on a survey of chief human resources officers and
   top strategy executives from companies across nine broad industry
   categories and covering 15 of the world's largest economies. These are;
   Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico,
   South Africa, Turkey, the UnitedKingdom and the United States, plus the
   ASEAN and GCC groups. Together, these economies account for 65% of the
   global workforce. A major goal of the report is to analyse the impact
   of key drivers of change and provide specific information on the
   relative magnitude of these expected changes by industry and geography,
   and the expected time horizon for their impact to be felt on job
   functions, employment levels and skills.

   In terms of overall impact, the report indicates that the nature of
   change over the next five years is such that as many as 7.1 million
   jobs could be lost through redundancy, automation or disintermediation,
   with the greatest losses in white-collar office and administrative
   roles. This loss is predicted to be partially offset by the creation of
   2.1 million new jobs, mainly in more specialized “job families”, such
   as Computer and Mathematical or Architecture and Engineering.

   These predictions are likely to be relatively conservative and leave no
   room for complacency. Yet the impact of disruption will vary
   considerably across industry and gender as well as job type. For
   example, Healthcare is expected to experience the greatest negative
   impact in terms of jobs in the next five years, followed jointly by
   Energy and Financial Services and Investors. The industry that stands
   to create the most jobs, perhaps less surprisingly, is Information and
   Communication Technology, followed by Professional Services and Media,
   Entertainment and Information professionals.

   “Without urgent and targeted action today to manage the near-term
   transition and build a workforce with futureproof skills, governments
   will have to cope with ever-growing unemployment and inequality, and
   businesses with a shrinking consumer base,” said Klaus Schwab, Founder
   and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum

   There is also a gender implication to the future of jobs. Based on the
   absolute job gains and losses mentioned above, the burden of job losses
   seems to fall equally on women (48%) and men (52%). However, given that
   men represent a larger share of the overall job market than women, this
   even spread translates into a widening of the employment gender gap,
   with women losing five jobs for every job gained compared with men
   losing three jobs for every job gained. This is also partly explained
   by low participation by women in the “job families” that are expected
   to grow, such as Computers and Mathematics, thus adding to the urgency
   with which leaders must address the chronic problem of getting more
   women into STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics)
   professions.

   When it comes to respondents’ outlook on how best to deal with these
   sweeping changes, the news is more encouraging. The most popular
   workforce strategy across every industry is investing in reskilling
   current employees. Other practices, such as supporting mobility and job
   rotation, attracting female and foreign talent and offering
   apprenticeships, also scored high. Hiring more short-term or virtual
   workers are much less popular responses. Indeed, the survey suggests
   that those companies that are treating future workforce planning as a
   priority are almost 50% more likely to invest in reskilling than those
   that do not. The report also indicates that those companies that report
   satisfaction in their future workforce strategy are more than twice as
   likely to be targeting female talent, and significantly less likely to
   be planning on hiring more short-term workers.

   Drivers of Change

   The most significant driver of change – across all industries – is the
   changing nature of work itself. As new technologies make “anytime,
   anywhere” work possible, companies are breaking up tasks in new ways,
   leading to a fragmentation of jobs across many industries. These
   effects are further compounded by the rise of mobile internet and cloud
   technology, enabling the rapid spread of internet-based service models.
   However, while the new “gig economy” may be one of the most visible and
   current manifestations of disruptions to the labour market, there is
   more change – both positive and negative – expected in specific
   industries, leading to new management and regulatory challenges.

   Further unpacking the bundle of technological drivers of change in the
   Fourth Industrial Revolution yields a rather more optimistic picture on
   the job creation potential of technologies such as big data analytics,
   mobile internet, the internet of things and robotics. However, by far
   the biggest expected drivers of employment creation are demographic and
   socio-economic in nature; in particular, the opportunities offered by
   young demographics and rising middle classes in emerging markets and
   the rising economic power and aspirations of women. Conversely, the
   survey respondents predict that increasing geopolitical volatility
   risks are the biggest threat – by far – to employment and job creation
   globally.

   Regional Analysis

   At country level, expectations of the nature of upcoming disruptions
   are shaped by the demographic, economic and technological development
   of the country in question. Overall, changing and flexible work is seen
   as the most significant driver of change in advanced economies, whereas
   the rising middle class takes this role in emerging markets. New energy
   supplies and technologies are expected to play the largest role in the
   Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, while climate change
   adaptation is seen as a particularly major driver in Germany. A number
   of developing countries expect particularly large impact from the
   mobile internet given that the technology has the potential to bring
   millions of formerly unconnected workers and consumers into the formal
   economy for the first time.

   Skills instability – the rapid change in the skills requirements of all
   existing jobs – will also impact countries differently. While ASEAN,
   GCC and Japan will have only 25% instability in the top skills mix
   overall, in Turkey, China, India and Italy over 40% of the top skills
   required across all jobs will change in the next five years. In the
   United Kingdom, 28% of the top skills mix is expected to change by 2020
   while in the United States this number is expected to be 29%. In France
   (28%) and Germany (39%) the situation is even more challenging.

   Employment outlook is net positive in only five of the 15 countries
   covered, but even in those countries there is significant job churn –
   with some functions becoming redundant as new ones emerge. Using the
   forecasts from chief human resource officers and current employment
   data, the highest ratios of jobs created per job lost is expected to be
   in ASEAN (3.72 jobs gained per job lost), Mexico (3.06), United Kingdom
   (2.91), United States (1.37) and Turkey (1.14). In all other countries
   covered by the Future of Jobs report, there is an expected net loss in
   jobs.

   Industry and Occupation Analysis

   Drivers of change will also have a very disparate impact within
   specific industries. For example, new energy supplies and technologies
   will have a particular impact on Energy, Basic and Infrastructure, and
   Mobility. Processing power and big data will have an especially strong
   impact on Information and Communication Technology, Financial Services
   and Professional Services. The rising middle class in emerging markets
   will have the largest effect on Consumer, Financial Services and
   Mobility. Consumer ethics and privacy issues will have a significant
   impact on the Consumer, Financial Services and Information and
   Communication Technology sectors. The business model changes created by
   these drivers will, in turn, have specific and different consequences
   for employment and skills needs in each industry. While there is a
   modestly positive outlook for employment across most sectors over the
   2015-2020 period, underneath this aggregate outlook there is
   significant relative growth in some job families and significant
   relative decline in others.

   Skills instability is expected to impact all industries but is
   particularly pronounced in Financial Services where 43% of the top
   skills needed in all job families across the industry are expected to
   change by 2020. The next most affected industries are Basics and
   Infrastructure (42%) and Mobility (39%). The least affected by 2020 are
   Media, Entertainment and Information (27%) – unsurprisingly, as the
   industry is already in the midst of a major skills displacement – and
   Consumer industry (30%).

   The survey respondents expect strong employment growth across the
   Architecture and Engineering and Computer and Mathematical job
   families, a moderate decline in Manufacturing and Production roles and
   a significant decline in office and administrative roles. Other
   sizeable job families, such as Business and Financial Operations, Sales
   and Related and Construction and Extraction have a largely flat global
   employment outlook over the 2015-2020 period. However, across all job
   families, chief human resource officers expect major challenges in
   recruiting.

   Our research also explicitly asked respondents about new and emerging
   job categories and functions that they expect to become critically
   important to their industry by the year 2020, and where within their
   global operations they would expect to locate such roles. Two job types
   stand out due to the frequency and consistency with which they were
   mentioned across practically all industries and geographies. The first
   are data analysts, which companies expect will help them make sense of
   the torrent of data generated by the technological disruptions
   referenced above. The second are specialized sales representatives, as
   practically every industry will need to become skilled in
   commercializing and explaining their offerings to clients. Other new
   specialties frequently mentioned include new types of human resources
   and organizational development specialists, engineering specialties
   such as materials, biochemicals, nanotech and robotics, regulatory and
   government relations specialists, geospatial information systems
   experts, and commercial and industrial designers.

   The Case for Cooperation

   While forecasts vary by industry and region, momentous change is under
   way and, ultimately, it is our actions today that will determine
   whether that change mainly results in massive displacement of workers
   or the emergence of new opportunities.

   One of the major barriers to change identified by chief human resource
   officers is the lack of specificity on the types of disruptive change
   under way. Our dataset aims to bring specificity to the debate and to
   the options for action by providing the perspective of chief human
   resources officers of leading employers who are among those at the
   frontline of the emerging trends and are key actors in implementing
   future workforce strategies. “Our analysis reveals that upcoming
   disruptions to the employment landscape will be about much more than
   simply automation. It is essential that we act collectively now to
   prepare ourselves for the changes that we know the Fourth Industrial
   Revolution will bring,” said Saadia Zahidi, Head of the Global
   Challenge on Employment, Skills and Human Capital at the World Economic
   Forum.

   In part, this will entail business taking more responsibility for
   upskilling, reskilling and collaborating rather than competing on
   talent. In addition, it is imperative that governments put in place
   rapid and fundamental change in education systems to prepare for the
   new labour market. The World Economic Forum’s Global Challenge
   Initiative on Employment, Skills and Human Capital (see below) brings
   together businesses and governments to collaborate on making these
   solutions a reality.

   Methodology

   The Future of Jobs Survey that formed the basis of the report covers
   over 350 of the largest companies in the world, including over 150 of
   the Fortune Global 500. In addition to the individual company
   responses. we had over 1,300 detailed occupation-level data points on
   mass employment, specialist and newly emerging occupations based in
   specific geographic locations across these companies’ global
   operations. The survey respondents primarily included chief human
   resource officers, chief strategy officers and other senior talent and
   strategy executives. The target pool of respondents comprised, as the
   primary selection criterion, the 100 largest global employers in each
   of our target industry sectors. In addition to the aggregate analysis,
   the report contains 15 country or regional profiles and nine industry
   profiles providing detailed information for each on the current
   situation and the 2020 outlook.

   Global Challenge on Employment, Skills and Human Capital

   The World Economic Forum’s Global Challenge Initiative on Employment,
   Skills and Human Capital produces analytical tools such as the Human
   Capital Report, the Disrupting Unemployment compendium and the Future
   of Jobs report to allow companies and countries to benchmark their
   current performance, assess their prospects and learn from best
   practices. In addition, the Challenge Initiative serves as a platform
   for public-private partnerships to address skills gaps and prepare for
   the future of jobs in selected regions and countries. It cooperates
   with industries to analyse employment and skills needs and implement
   solutions, working closely with global multistakeholder communities of
   leaders and experts dedicated to boosting employment, closing skills
   gaps and improving education.

   Partners of the Global Challenge on Employment, Skills and Human
   Capital are: Adecco Group, African Rainbow Minerals, Alghanim
   Industries, AlixPartners, The Bahrain Economic Development Board,
   Chobani, The Coca-Cola Company, Edelman, GEMS Education, Infosys,
   LinkedIn, ManpowerGroup, Mercer, Microsoft Corporation, Pearson, The
   Rockefeller Foundation, SAP, Saudi Aramco, Siemens, Tata Consultancy
   Services, Tupperware Brands Corporation, Uber, Workday, WPP and Zain.

   Global waste could grow by 70 percent by 2050 as urbanisation and
   populations rise, said the World Bank on Thursday, with South Asia and
   Sub-Saharan Africa set to generate the biggest increase in rubbish.

   Countries could reap economic and environmental benefits by better
   collecting, recycling and disposing of trash, according to a report,
   which calculated that a third of the world's waste is instead dumped
   openly, with no treatment.

   "We really need to pay attention to South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa,
   as by 2050, South Asia's waste will double, sub-Saharan Africa's waste
   will triple," said Silpa Kaza, World Bank urban development specialist
   and report lead author.

   "If we don't take any action it could have quite significant
   implications for health, productivity, environment, livelihoods," she
   told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Belarus.

   The rise in rubbish will outstrip population growth, reaching 3.4
   billion tons by 2050 from around 2 billion tons in 2016, according to
   the report.

   High-income countries produce a third of the world's waste, despite
   having only 16 percent of world's population, while a quarter comes
   from East Asia and the Pacific regions, it said.

   While more than a third of waste globally ends up in landfill, over 90
   percent is dumped openly in lower income countries that often lack
   adequate disposal and treatment facilities, said the report.

   A booming waste burden could also contribute to climate change impact,
   with the treatment and disposal of current waste levels generating
   around 5 percent of carbon emissions.

   Adequate financing for collection and disposal is one of the biggest
   issues for cities that often struggle to cover the costs of providing
   waste services, said Kaza.

   "If the incentives are aligned and there's an ability for contracts to
   be enforced, then the private sector can be a really powerful player,"
   she said.

     * China has stopped taking the world's plastic waste. Now many
       countries have a big problem
     * As the world fights plastic waste, could food waste be next?

   Boosting recycling and cutting plastics consumption along with food
   waste could help reduce rubbish, said the report, which noted a number
   of low income countries lack laws to deal with waste.

   Plastics, which can contaminate waterways and ecosystems for thousands
   of years, comprise 12 percent of all waste, the World Bank said.

   "Unfortunately, it is often the poorest in society who are adversely
   impacted by inadequate waste management," Laura Tuck, World Bank
   sustainable development vice president, said in a statement.

   "It doesn't have to be this way. Our resources need to be used and then
   reused continuously so that they don't end up in landfills."

Five Million Jobs by 2020: the Real Challenge of the Fourth Industrial
Revolution

   · The Fourth Industrial Revolution, combined with other socio-economic
   and demographic changes, will transform labour markets in the next five
   years, leading to a net loss of over 5 million jobs in 15 major
   developed and emerging economies

   · Skills and jobs displacement will affect every industry and
   geographical region, but losses can be offset by job growth in key
   areas

   · A clear majority of businesses believe that investing in skills,
   rather than hiring more short-term or virtual workers, is the key to
   successfully managing disruptions to the labour market for the long
   term

   · The new research by the World Economic Forum is the first of its
   kind, representing more than 13 million employees in nine industry
   sectors and 15 economies; it aims to guide business and policy-makers
   on how to equip labour forces with the skills to navigate the
   disruption of the Fourth Industrial Revolution

   Geneva, Switzerland, 18 January 2016 – The Fourth Industrial
   Revolution, which includes developments in previously disjointed fields
   such as artificial intelligence and machine-learning, robotics,
   nanotechnology, 3-D printing, and genetics and biotechnology, will
   cause widespread disruption not only to business models but also to
   labour markets over the next five years, with enormous change predicted
   in the skill sets needed to thrive in the new landscape. This is the
   finding of a new report, The Future of Jobs, published today by the
   World Economic Forum.

   The report is based on a survey of chief human resources officers and
   top strategy executives from companies across nine broad industry
   categories and covering 15 of the world's largest economies. These are;
   Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico,
   South Africa, Turkey, the UnitedKingdom and the United States, plus the
   ASEAN and GCC groups. Together, these economies account for 65% of the
   global workforce. A major goal of the report is to analyse the impact
   of key drivers of change and provide specific information on the
   relative magnitude of these expected changes by industry and geography,
   and the expected time horizon for their impact to be felt on job
   functions, employment levels and skills.

   In terms of overall impact, the report indicates that the nature of
   change over the next five years is such that as many as 7.1 million
   jobs could be lost through redundancy, automation or disintermediation,
   with the greatest losses in white-collar office and administrative
   roles. This loss is predicted to be partially offset by the creation of
   2.1 million new jobs, mainly in more specialized “job families”, such
   as Computer and Mathematical or Architecture and Engineering.

   These predictions are likely to be relatively conservative and leave no
   room for complacency. Yet the impact of disruption will vary
   considerably across industry and gender as well as job type. For
   example, Healthcare is expected to experience the greatest negative
   impact in terms of jobs in the next five years, followed jointly by
   Energy and Financial Services and Investors. The industry that stands
   to create the most jobs, perhaps less surprisingly, is Information and
   Communication Technology, followed by Professional Services and Media,
   Entertainment and Information professionals.

   “Without urgent and targeted action today to manage the near-term
   transition and build a workforce with futureproof skills, governments
   will have to cope with ever-growing unemployment and inequality, and
   businesses with a shrinking consumer base,” said Klaus Schwab, Founder
   and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum

   There is also a gender implication to the future of jobs. Based on the
   absolute job gains and losses mentioned above, the burden of job losses
   seems to fall equally on women (48%) and men (52%). However, given that
   men represent a larger share of the overall job market than women, this
   even spread translates into a widening of the employment gender gap,
   with women losing five jobs for every job gained compared with men
   losing three jobs for every job gained. This is also partly explained
   by low participation by women in the “job families” that are expected
   to grow, such as Computers and Mathematics, thus adding to the urgency
   with which leaders must address the chronic problem of getting more
   women into STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics)
   professions.

   When it comes to respondents’ outlook on how best to deal with these
   sweeping changes, the news is more encouraging. The most popular
   workforce strategy across every industry is investing in reskilling
   current employees. Other practices, such as supporting mobility and job
   rotation, attracting female and foreign talent and offering
   apprenticeships, also scored high. Hiring more short-term or virtual
   workers are much less popular responses. Indeed, the survey suggests
   that those companies that are treating future workforce planning as a
   priority are almost 50% more likely to invest in reskilling than those
   that do not. The report also indicates that those companies that report
   satisfaction in their future workforce strategy are more than twice as
   likely to be targeting female talent, and significantly less likely to
   be planning on hiring more short-term workers.

   Drivers of Change

   The most significant driver of change – across all industries – is the
   changing nature of work itself. As new technologies make “anytime,
   anywhere” work possible, companies are breaking up tasks in new ways,
   leading to a fragmentation of jobs across many industries. These
   effects are further compounded by the rise of mobile internet and cloud
   technology, enabling the rapid spread of internet-based service models.
   However, while the new “gig economy” may be one of the most visible and
   current manifestations of disruptions to the labour market, there is
   more change – both positive and negative – expected in specific
   industries, leading to new management and regulatory challenges.

   Further unpacking the bundle of technological drivers of change in the
   Fourth Industrial Revolution yields a rather more optimistic picture on
   the job creation potential of technologies such as big data analytics,
   mobile internet, the internet of things and robotics. However, by far
   the biggest expected drivers of employment creation are demographic and
   socio-economic in nature; in particular, the opportunities offered by
   young demographics and rising middle classes in emerging markets and
   the rising economic power and aspirations of women. Conversely, the
   survey respondents predict that increasing geopolitical volatility
   risks are the biggest threat – by far – to employment and job creation
   globally.

   Regional Analysis

   At country level, expectations of the nature of upcoming disruptions
   are shaped by the demographic, economic and technological development
   of the country in question. Overall, changing and flexible work is seen
   as the most significant driver of change in advanced economies, whereas
   the rising middle class takes this role in emerging markets. New energy
   supplies and technologies are expected to play the largest role in the
   Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, while climate change
   adaptation is seen as a particularly major driver in Germany. A number
   of developing countries expect particularly large impact from the
   mobile internet given that the technology has the potential to bring
   millions of formerly unconnected workers and consumers into the formal
   economy for the first time.

   Skills instability – the rapid change in the skills requirements of all
   existing jobs – will also impact countries differently. While ASEAN,
   GCC and Japan will have only 25% instability in the top skills mix
   overall, in Turkey, China, India and Italy over 40% of the top skills
   required across all jobs will change in the next five years. In the
   United Kingdom, 28% of the top skills mix is expected to change by 2020
   while in the United States this number is expected to be 29%. In France
   (28%) and Germany (39%) the situation is even more challenging.

   Employment outlook is net positive in only five of the 15 countries
   covered, but even in those countries there is significant job churn –
   with some functions becoming redundant as new ones emerge. Using the
   forecasts from chief human resource officers and current employment
   data, the highest ratios of jobs created per job lost is expected to be
   in ASEAN (3.72 jobs gained per job lost), Mexico (3.06), United Kingdom
   (2.91), United States (1.37) and Turkey (1.14). In all other countries
   covered by the Future of Jobs report, there is an expected net loss in
   jobs.

   Industry and Occupation Analysis

   Drivers of change will also have a very disparate impact within
   specific industries. For example, new energy supplies and technologies
   will have a particular impact on Energy, Basic and Infrastructure, and
   Mobility. Processing power and big data will have an especially strong
   impact on Information and Communication Technology, Financial Services
   and Professional Services. The rising middle class in emerging markets
   will have the largest effect on Consumer, Financial Services and
   Mobility. Consumer ethics and privacy issues will have a significant
   impact on the Consumer, Financial Services and Information and
   Communication Technology sectors. The business model changes created by
   these drivers will, in turn, have specific and different consequences
   for employment and skills needs in each industry. While there is a
   modestly positive outlook for employment across most sectors over the
   2015-2020 period, underneath this aggregate outlook there is
   significant relative growth in some job families and significant
   relative decline in others.

   Skills instability is expected to impact all industries but is
   particularly pronounced in Financial Services where 43% of the top
   skills needed in all job families across the industry are expected to
   change by 2020. The next most affected industries are Basics and
   Infrastructure (42%) and Mobility (39%). The least affected by 2020 are
   Media, Entertainment and Information (27%) – unsurprisingly, as the
   industry is already in the midst of a major skills displacement – and
   Consumer industry (30%).

   The survey respondents expect strong employment growth across the
   Architecture and Engineering and Computer and Mathematical job
   families, a moderate decline in Manufacturing and Production roles and
   a significant decline in office and administrative roles. Other
   sizeable job families, such as Business and Financial Operations, Sales
   and Related and Construction and Extraction have a largely flat global
   employment outlook over the 2015-2020 period. However, across all job
   families, chief human resource officers expect major challenges in
   recruiting.

   Our research also explicitly asked respondents about new and emerging
   job categories and functions that they expect to become critically
   important to their industry by the year 2020, and where within their
   global operations they would expect to locate such roles. Two job types
   stand out due to the frequency and consistency with which they were
   mentioned across practically all industries and geographies. The first
   are data analysts, which companies expect will help them make sense of
   the torrent of data generated by the technological disruptions
   referenced above. The second are specialized sales representatives, as
   practically every industry will need to become skilled in
   commercializing and explaining their offerings to clients. Other new
   specialties frequently mentioned include new types of human resources
   and organizational development specialists, engineering specialties
   such as materials, biochemicals, nanotech and robotics, regulatory and
   government relations specialists, geospatial information systems
   experts, and commercial and industrial designers.

   The Case for Cooperation

   While forecasts vary by industry and region, momentous change is under
   way and, ultimately, it is our actions today that will determine
   whether that change mainly results in massive displacement of workers
   or the emergence of new opportunities.

   One of the major barriers to change identified by chief human resource
   officers is the lack of specificity on the types of disruptive change
   under way. Our dataset aims to bring specificity to the debate and to
   the options for action by providing the perspective of chief human
   resources officers of leading employers who are among those at the
   frontline of the emerging trends and are key actors in implementing
   future workforce strategies. “Our analysis reveals that upcoming
   disruptions to the employment landscape will be about much more than
   simply automation. It is essential that we act collectively now to
   prepare ourselves for the changes that we know the Fourth Industrial
   Revolution will bring,” said Saadia Zahidi, Head of the Global
   Challenge on Employment, Skills and Human Capital at the World Economic
   Forum.

   In part, this will entail business taking more responsibility for
   upskilling, reskilling and collaborating rather than competing on
   talent. In addition, it is imperative that governments put in place
   rapid and fundamental change in education systems to prepare for the
   new labour market. The World Economic Forum’s Global Challenge
   Initiative on Employment, Skills and Human Capital (see below) brings
   together businesses and governments to collaborate on making these
   solutions a reality.

   Methodology

   The Future of Jobs Survey that formed the basis of the report covers
   over 350 of the largest companies in the world, including over 150 of
   the Fortune Global 500. In addition to the individual company
   responses. we had over 1,300 detailed occupation-level data points on
   mass employment, specialist and newly emerging occupations based in
   specific geographic locations across these companies’ global
   operations. The survey respondents primarily included chief human
   resource officers, chief strategy officers and other senior talent and
   strategy executives. The target pool of respondents comprised, as the
   primary selection criterion, the 100 largest global employers in each
   of our target industry sectors. In addition to the aggregate analysis,
   the report contains 15 country or regional profiles and nine industry
   profiles providing detailed information for each on the current
   situation and the 2020 outlook.

   Global Challenge on Employment, Skills and Human Capital

   The World Economic Forum’s Global Challenge Initiative on Employment,
   Skills and Human Capital produces analytical tools such as the Human
   Capital Report, the Disrupting Unemployment compendium and the Future
   of Jobs report to allow companies and countries to benchmark their
   current performance, assess their prospects and learn from best
   practices. In addition, the Challenge Initiative serves as a platform
   for public-private partnerships to address skills gaps and prepare for
   the future of jobs in selected regions and countries. It cooperates
   with industries to analyse employment and skills needs and implement
   solutions, working closely with global multistakeholder communities of
   leaders and experts dedicated to boosting employment, closing skills
   gaps and improving education.

   Partners of the Global Challenge on Employment, Skills and Human
   Capital are: Adecco Group, African Rainbow Minerals, Alghanim

   The world wastes more than 1.3 billion tonnes of food each year. The
   planet’s 1 billion hungry people could be fed on less than a quarter of
   the food wasted in the US and Europe.
   Image: UN FAO

   In a recent report, the World Economic Forum identified cutting food
   waste by up to 20 million tonnes as one of 12 measures that could help
   transform global food systems by 2030.

   Now South Korea is taking a lead, recycling 95% of its food waste.

       waste

   It wasn’t always this way in the country. The mouth-watering array of
   side dishes that accompany a traditional South Korean meal - called
   banchan - are often left unfinished, contributing to one of the world’s
   highest rates of food wastage. South Koreans each generate more than
   130 kg of food waste each year.

   By comparison, per capita food waste in Europe and North America is 95
   to 115 kg a year, according to the Food and Agricultural Organization
   of the United Nations. But the South Korean government has taken
   radical action to ensure that the mountain of wasted food is recycled.

   As far back as 2005, dumping food in landfill was banned, and in 2013
   the government introduced compulsory food waste recycling using special
   biodegradable bags. An average four-person family pays $6 a month for
   the bags, a fee that helps encourage home composting.

   The bag charges also meet 60% of the cost of running the scheme, which
   has increased the amount of food waste recycled from 2% in 1995 to 95%
   today. The government has approved the use of recycled food waste as
   fertilizer, although some becomes animal feed.

   Smart bins

   Technology has played a leading part in the success of the scheme. In
   the country’s capital, Seoul, 6,000 automated bins equipped with scales
   and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) weigh food waste as it is
   deposited and charge residents using an ID card. The pay-as-you-recycle
   machines have reduced food waste in the city by 47,000 tonnes in six
   years, according to city officials.

   Residents are urged to reduce the weight of the waste they deposit by
   removing moisture first. Not only does this cut the charges they pay -
   food waste is around 80% moisture - but it also saved the city $8.4
   million in collection charges over the same period.

   Waste collected using the biodegradable bag scheme is squeezed at the
   processing plant to remove moisture, which is used to create biogas and
   bio oil. Dry waste is turned into fertiliser that is, in turn, helping
   to drive the country’s burgeoning urban farm movement.

   Urban farms

   The number of urban farms or community gardens in Seoul has increased
   sixfold in the past seven years. They now total 170 hectares - roughly
   the size of 240 football fields. Most are sandwiched between apartment
   blocks or on top of schools and municipal buildings. One is even
   located in the basement of an apartment block. It is used to grow
   mushrooms.

   The city government provides between 80% and 100% of the start-up
   costs. As well as providing food, proponents of the scheme say urban
   farms bring people together as a community in areas where residents are
   often isolated from one another. The city authorities are planning to
   install food waste composters to support urban farms.

   Which brings us back to banchan. In the long term, some people argue
   South Koreans will need to change their eating habits if they are
   really going to make a dent in their food waste.

   Kim Mi-hwa, chair of the Korea Zero Waste Movement Network, told
   Huffington Post: “There’s a limit to how much food waste fertilizer can
   actually be used. This means there has to be a change in our dining
   habits, such as shifting to a one-plate culinary culture like other
   countries, or at least reducing the amount of banchan that we lay out.”

Five Million Jobs by 2020: the Real Challenge of the Fourth Industrial
Revolution

   · The Fourth Industrial Revolution, combined with other socio-economic
   and demographic changes, will transform labour markets in the next five
   years, leading to a net loss of over 5 million jobs in 15 major
   developed and emerging economies

   · Skills and jobs displacement will affect every industry and
   geographical region, but losses can be offset by job growth in key
   areas

   · A clear majority of businesses believe that investing in skills,
   rather than hiring more short-term or virtual workers, is the key to
   successfully managing disruptions to the labour market for the long
   term

   · The new research by the World Economic Forum is the first of its
   kind, representing more than 13 million employees in nine industry
   sectors and 15 economies; it aims to guide business and policy-makers
   on how to equip labour forces with the skills to navigate the
   disruption of the Fourth Industrial Revolution

   information about the Annual Meeting 2016, visit www.weforum.org

   Geneva, Switzerland, 18 January 2016 – The Fourth Industrial
   Revolution, which includes developments in previously disjointed fields
   such as artificial intelligence and machine-learning, robotics,
   nanotechnology, 3-D printing, and genetics and biotechnology, will
   cause widespread disruption not only to business models but also to
   labour markets over the next five years, with enormous change predicted
   in the skill sets needed to thrive in the new landscape. This is the
   finding of a new report, The Future of Jobs, published today by the
   World Economic Forum.

   The report is based on a survey of chief human resources officers and
   top strategy executives from companies across nine broad industry
   categories and covering 15 of the world's largest economies. These are;
   Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico,
   South Africa, Turkey, the UnitedKingdom and the United States, plus the
   ASEAN and GCC groups. Together, these economies account for 65% of the
   global workforce. A major goal of the report is to analyse the impact
   of key drivers of change and provide specific information on the
   relative magnitude of these expected changes by industry and geography,
   and the expected time horizon for their impact to be felt on job
   functions, employment levels and skills.

   In terms of overall impact, the report indicates that the nature of
   change over the next five years is such that as many as 7.1 million
   jobs could be lost through redundancy, automation or disintermediation,
   with the greatest losses in white-collar office and administrative
   roles. This loss is predicted to be partially offset by the creation of
   2.1 million new jobs, mainly in more specialized “job families”, such
   as Computer and Mathematical or Architecture and Engineering.

   These predictions are likely to be relatively conservative and leave no
   room for complacency. Yet the impact of disruption will vary
   considerably across industry and gender as well as job type. For
   example, Healthcare is expected to experience the greatest negative
   impact in terms of jobs in the next five years, followed jointly by
   Energy and Financial Services and Investors. The industry that stands
   to create the most jobs, perhaps less surprisingly, is Information and
   Communication Technology, followed by Professional Services and Media,
   Entertainment and Information professionals.

   “Without urgent and targeted action today to manage the near-term
   transition and build a workforce with futureproof skills, governments
   will have to cope with ever-growing unemployment and inequality, and
   businesses with a shrinking consumer base,” said Klaus Schwab, Founder
   and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum

   There is also a gender implication to the future of jobs. Based on the
   absolute job gains and losses mentioned above, the burden of job losses
   seems to fall equally on women (48%) and men (52%). However, given that
   men represent a larger share of the overall job market than women, this
   even spread translates into a widening of the employment gender gap,
   with women losing five jobs for every job gained compared with men
   losing three jobs for every job gained. This is also partly explained
   by low participation by women in the “job families” that are expected
   to grow, such as Computers and Mathematics, thus adding to the urgency
   with which leaders must address the chronic problem of getting more
   women into STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics)
   professions.

   When it comes to respondents’ outlook on how best to deal with these
   sweeping changes, the news is more encouraging. The most popular
   workforce strategy across every industry is investing in reskilling
   current employees. Other practices, such as supporting mobility and job
   rotation, attracting female and foreign talent and offering
   apprenticeships, also scored high. Hiring more short-term or virtual
   workers are much less popular responses. Indeed, the survey suggests
   that those companies that are treating future workforce planning as a
   priority are almost 50% more likely to invest in reskilling than those
   that do not. The report also indicates that those companies that report
   satisfaction in their future workforce strategy are more than twice as
   likely to be targeting female talent, and significantly less likely to
   be planning on hiring more short-term workers.

   Drivers of Change

   The most significant driver of change – across all industries – is the
   changing nature of work itself. As new technologies make “anytime,
   anywhere” work possible, companies are breaking up tasks in new ways,
   leading to a fragmentation of jobs across many industries. These
   effects are further compounded by the rise of mobile internet and cloud
   technology, enabling the rapid spread of internet-based service models.
   However, while the new “gig economy” may be one of the most visible and
   current manifestations of disruptions to the labour market, there is
   more change – both positive and negative – expected in specific
   industries, leading to new management and regulatory challenges.

   Further unpacking the bundle of technological drivers of change in the
   Fourth Industrial Revolution yields a rather more optimistic picture on
   the job creation potential of technologies such as big data analytics,
   mobile internet, the internet of things and robotics. However, by far
   the biggest expected drivers of employment creation are demographic and
   socio-economic in nature; in particular, the opportunities offered by
   young demographics and rising middle classes in emerging markets and
   the rising economic power and aspirations of women. Conversely, the
   survey respondents predict that increasing geopolitical volatility
   risks are the biggest threat – by far – to employment and job creation
   globally.

   Regional Analysis

   At country level, expectations of the nature of upcoming disruptions
   are shaped by the demographic, economic and technological development
   of the country in question. Overall, changing and flexible work is seen
   as the most significant driver of change in advanced economies, whereas
   the rising middle class takes this role in emerging markets. New energy
   supplies and technologies are expected to play the largest role in the
   Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, while climate change
   adaptation is seen as a particularly major driver in Germany. A number
   of developing countries expect particularly large impact from the
   mobile internet given that the technology has the potential to bring
   millions of formerly unconnected workers and consumers into the formal
   economy for the first time.

   Skills instability – the rapid change in the skills requirements of all
   existing jobs – will also impact countries differently. While ASEAN,
   GCC and Japan will have only 25% instability in the top skills mix
   overall, in Turkey, China, India and Italy over 40% of the top skills
   required across all jobs will change in the next five years. In the
   United Kingdom, 28% of the top skills mix is expected to change by 2020
   while in the United States this number is expected to be 29%. In France
   (28%) and Germany (39%) the situation is even more challenging.

   Employment outlook is net positive in only five of the 15 countries
   covered, but even in those countries there is significant job churn –
   with some functions becoming redundant as new ones emerge. Using the
   forecasts from chief human resource officers and current employment
   data, the highest ratios of jobs created per job lost is expected to be
   in ASEAN (3.72 jobs gained per job lost), Mexico (3.06), United Kingdom
   (2.91), United States (1.37) and Turkey (1.14). In all other countries
   covered by the Future of Jobs report, there is an expected net loss in
   jobs.

   Industry and Occupation Analysis

   Drivers of change will also have a very disparate impact within
   specific industries. For example, new energy supplies and technologies
   will have a particular impact on Energy, Basic and Infrastructure, and
   Mobility. Processing power and big data will have an especially strong
   impact on Information and Communication Technology, Financial Services
   and Professional Services. The rising middle class in emerging markets
   will have the largest effect on Consumer, Financial Services and
   Mobility. Consumer ethics and privacy issues will have a significant
   impact on the Consumer, Financial Services and Information and
   Communication Technology sectors. The business model changes created by
   these drivers will, in turn, have specific and different consequences
   for employment and skills needs in each industry. While there is a
   modestly positive outlook for employment across most sectors over the
   2015-2020 period, underneath this aggregate outlook there is
   significant relative growth in some job families and significant
   relative decline in others.

   Skills instability is expected to impact all industries but is
   particularly pronounced in Financial Services where 43% of the top
   skills needed in all job families across the industry are expected to
   change by 2020. The next most affected industries are Basics and
   Infrastructure (42%) and Mobility (39%). The least affected by 2020 are
   Media, Entertainment and Information (27%) – unsurprisingly, as the
   industry is already in the midst of a major skills displacement – and
   Consumer industry (30%).

   The survey respondents expect strong employment growth across the
   Architecture and Engineering and Computer and Mathematical job
   families, a moderate decline in Manufacturing and Production roles and
   a significant decline in office and administrative roles. Other
   sizeable job families, such as Business and Financial Operations, Sales
   and Related and Construction and Extraction have a largely flat global
   employment outlook over the 2015-2020 period. However, across all job
   families, chief human resource officers expect major challenges in
   recruiting.

   Our research also explicitly asked respondents about new and emerging
   job categories and functions that they expect to become critically
   important to their industry by the year 2020, and where within their
   global operations they would expect to locate such roles. Two job types
   stand out due to the frequency and consistency with which they were
   mentioned across practically all industries and geographies. The first
   are data analysts, which companies expect will help them make sense of
   the torrent of data generated by the technological disruptions
   referenced above. The second are specialized sales representatives, as
   practically every industry will need to become skilled in
   commercializing and explaining their offerings to clients. Other new
   specialties frequently mentioned include new types of human resources
   and organizational development specialists, engineering specialties
   such as materials, biochemicals, nanotech and robotics, regulatory and
   government relations specialists, geospatial information systems
   experts, and commercial and industrial designers.

   The Case for Cooperation

   While forecasts vary by industry and region, momentous change is under
   way and, ultimately, it is our actions today that will determine
   whether that change mainly results in massive displacement of workers
   or the emergence of new opportunities.

   One of the major barriers to change identified by chief human resource
   officers is the lack of specificity on the types of disruptive change
   under way. Our dataset aims to bring specificity to the debate and to
   the options for action by providing the perspective of chief human
   resources officers of leading employers who are among those at the
   frontline of the emerging trends and are key actors in implementing
   future workforce strategies. “Our analysis reveals that upcoming
   disruptions to the employment landscape will be about much more than
   simply automation. It is essential that we act collectively now to
   prepare ourselves for the changes that we know the Fourth Industrial
   Revolution will bring,” said Saadia Zahidi, Head of the Global
   Challenge on Employment, Skills and Human Capital at the World Economic
   Forum.

   In part, this will entail business taking more responsibility for
   upskilling, reskilling and collaborating rather than competing on
   talent. In addition, it is imperative that governments put in place
   rapid and fundamental change in education systems to prepare for the
   new labour market. The World Economic Forum’s Global Challenge
   Initiative on Employment, Skills and Human Capital (see below) brings
   together businesses and governments to collaborate on making these
   solutions a reality.

   Methodology

   The Future of Jobs Survey that formed the basis of the report covers
   over 350 of the largest companies in the world, including over 150 of
   the Fortune Global 500. In addition to the individual company
   responses. we had over 1,300 detailed occupation-level data points on
   mass employment, specialist and newly emerging occupations based in
   specific geographic locations across these companies’ global
   operations. The survey respondents primarily included chief human
   resource officers, chief strategy officers and other senior talent and
   strategy executives. The target pool of respondents comprised, as the
   primary selection criterion, the 100 largest global employers in each
   of our target industry sectors. In addition to the aggregate analysis,
   the report contains 15 country or regional profiles and nine industry
   profiles providing detailed information for each on the current
   situation and the 2020 outlook.

   Global Challenge on Employment, Skills and Human Capital

   The World Economic Forum’s Global Challenge Initiative on Employment,
   Skills and Human Capital produces analytical tools such as the Human
   Capital Report, the Disrupting Unemployment compendium and the Future
   of Jobs report to allow companies and countries to benchmark their
   current performance, assess their prospects and learn from best
   practices. In addition, the Challenge Initiative serves as a platform
   for public-private partnerships to address skills gaps and prepare for
   the future of jobs in selected regions and countries. It cooperates
   with industries to analyse employment and skills needs and implement
   solutions, working closely with global multistakeholder communities of
   leaders and experts dedicated to boosting employment, closing skills
   gaps and improving education.

   Partners of the Global Challenge on Employment, Skills and Human
   Capital are: Adecco Group, African Rainbow Minerals, Alghanim
   Industries, AlixPartners, The Bahrain Economic Development Board,
   Chobani, The Coca-Cola Company, Edelman, GEMS Education, Infosys,
   LinkedIn, ManpowerGroup, Mercer, Microsoft Corporation, Pearson, The
   Rockefeller Foundation, SAP, Saudi Aramco, Siemens, Tata Consultancy
   Services, Tupperware Brands Corporation, Uber, Workday, WPP and Zain.

   Over 2,500 leaders from business, government, international
   organizations, civil society, academia, media and the arts will
   participate in the 46th World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in
   Davos-Klosters, Switzerland, on 20-23 January. Under the theme,
   Mastering the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the programme comprises
   over 250 sessions, of which over 100 will be webcast live.

   Global waste could grow by 70 percent by 2050 as urbanisation and
   populations rise, said the World Bank on Thursday, with South Asia and
   Sub-Saharan Africa set to generate the biggest increase in rubbish.

   Countries could reap economic and environmental benefits by better
   collecting, recycling and disposing of trash, according to a report,
   which calculated that a third of the world's waste is instead dumped
   openly, with no treatment.

   "We really need to pay attention to South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa,
   as by 2050, South Asia's waste will double, sub-Saharan Africa's waste
   will triple," said Silpa Kaza, World Bank urban development specialist
   and report lead author.

   "If we don't take any action it could have quite significant
   implications for health, productivity, environment, livelihoods," she
   told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Belarus.

   The rise in rubbish will outstrip population growth, reaching 3.4
   billion tons by 2050 from around 2 billion tons in 2016, according to
   the report.

   High-income countries produce a third of the world's waste, despite
   having only 16 percent of world's population, while a quarter comes
   from East Asia and the Pacific regions, it said.

   While more than a third of waste globally ends up in landfill, over 90
   percent is dumped openly in lower income countries that often lack
   adequate disposal and treatment facilities, said the report.

   A booming waste burden could also contribute to climate change impact,
   with the treatment and disposal of current waste levels generating
   around 5 percent of carbon emissions.

   Adequate financing for collection and disposal is one of the biggest
   issues for cities that often struggle to cover the costs of providing
   waste services, said Kaza.

   "If the incentives are aligned and there's an ability for contracts to
   be enforced, then the private sector can be a really powerful player,"
   she said.

     * China has stopped taking the world's plastic waste. Now many
       countries have a big problem
     * As the world fights plastic waste, could food waste be next?

   Boosting recycling and cutting plastics consumption along with food
   waste could help reduce rubbish, said the report, which noted a number
   of low income countries lack laws to deal with waste.

   Plastics, which can contaminate waterways and ecosystems for thousands
   of years, comprise 12 percent of all waste, the World Bank said.

   "Unfortunately, it is often the poorest in society who are adversely
   impacted by inadequate waste management," Laura Tuck, World Bank
   sustainable development vice president, said in a statement.

   "It doesn't have to be this way. Our resources need to be used and then
   reused continuously so that they don't end up in landfills."

Five Million Jobs by 2020: the Real Challenge of the Fourth Industrial
Revolution

   · The Fourth Industrial Revolution, combined with other socio-economic
   and demographic changes, will transform labour markets in the next five
   years, leading to a net loss of over 5 million jobs in 15 major
   developed and emerging economies

   · Skills and jobs displacement will affect every industry and
   geographical region, but losses can be offset by job growth in key
   areas

   · A clear majority of businesses believe that investing in skills,
   rather than hiring more short-term or virtual workers, is the key to
   successfully managing disruptions to the labour market for the long
   term

   · The new research by the World Economic Forum is the first of its
   kind, representing more than 13 million employees in nine industry
   sectors and 15 economies; it aims to guide business and policy-makers
   on how to equip labour forces with the skills to navigate the
   disruption of the Fourth Industrial Revolution

   Geneva, Switzerland, 18 January 2016 – The Fourth Industrial
   Revolution, which includes developments in previously disjointed fields
   such as artificial intelligence and machine-learning, robotics,
   nanotechnology, 3-D printing, and genetics and biotechnology, will
   cause widespread disruption not only to business models but also to
   labour markets over the next five years, with enormous change predicted
   in the skill sets needed to thrive in the new landscape. This is the
   finding of a new report, The Future of Jobs, published today by the
   World Economic Forum.

   The report is based on a survey of chief human resources officers and
   top strategy executives from companies across nine broad industry
   categories and covering 15 of the world's largest economies. These are;
   Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico,
   South Africa, Turkey, the UnitedKingdom and the United States, plus the
   ASEAN and GCC groups. Together, these economies account for 65% of the
   global workforce. A major goal of the report is to analyse the impact
   of key drivers of change and provide specific information on the
   relative magnitude of these expected changes by industry and geography,
   and the expected time horizon for their impact to be felt on job
   functions, employment levels and skills.

   In terms of overall impact, the report indicates that the nature of
   change over the next five years is such that as many as 7.1 million
   jobs could be lost through redundancy, automation or disintermediation,
   with the greatest losses in white-collar office and administrative
   roles. This loss is predicted to be partially offset by the creation of
   2.1 million new jobs, mainly in more specialized “job families”, such
   as Computer and Mathematical or Architecture and Engineering.

   These predictions are likely to be relatively conservative and leave no
   room for complacency. Yet the impact of disruption will vary
   considerably across industry and gender as well as job type. For
   example, Healthcare is expected to experience the greatest negative
   impact in terms of jobs in the next five years, followed jointly by
   Energy and Financial Services and Investors. The industry that stands
   to create the most jobs, perhaps less surprisingly, is Information and
   Communication Technology, followed by Professional Services and Media,
   Entertainment and Information professionals.

   “Without urgent and targeted action today to manage the near-term
   transition and build a workforce with futureproof skills, governments
   will have to cope with ever-growing unemployment and inequality, and
   businesses with a shrinking consumer base,” said Klaus Schwab, Founder
   and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum

   There is also a gender implication to the future of jobs. Based on the
   absolute job gains and losses mentioned above, the burden of job losses
   seems to fall equally on women (48%) and men (52%). However, given that
   men represent a larger share of the overall job market than women, this
   even spread translates into a widening of the employment gender gap,
   with women losing five jobs for every job gained compared with men
   losing three jobs for every job gained. This is also partly explained
   by low participation by women in the “job families” that are expected
   to grow, such as Computers and Mathematics, thus adding to the urgency
   with which leaders must address the chronic problem of getting more
   women into STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics)
   professions.

   When it comes to respondents’ outlook on how best to deal with these
   sweeping changes, the news is more encouraging. The most popular
   workforce strategy across every industry is investing in reskilling
   current employees. Other practices, such as supporting mobility and job
   rotation, attracting female and foreign talent and offering
   apprenticeships, also scored high. Hiring more short-term or virtual
   workers are much less popular responses. Indeed, the survey suggests
   that those companies that are treating future workforce planning as a
   priority are almost 50% more likely to invest in reskilling than those
   that do not. The report also indicates that those companies that report
   satisfaction in their future workforce strategy are more than twice as
   likely to be targeting female talent, and significantly less likely to
   be planning on hiring more short-term workers.

   Drivers of Change

   The most significant driver of change – across all industries – is the
   changing nature of work itself. As new technologies make “anytime,
   anywhere” work possible, companies are breaking up tasks in new ways,
   leading to a fragmentation of jobs across many industries. These
   effects are further compounded by the rise of mobile internet and cloud
   technology, enabling the rapid spread of internet-based service models.
   However, while the new “gig economy” may be one of the most visible and
   current manifestations of disruptions to the labour market, there is
   more change – both positive and negative – expected in specific
   industries, leading to new management and regulatory challenges.

   Further unpacking the bundle of technological drivers of change in the
   Fourth Industrial Revolution yields a rather more optimistic picture on
   the job creation potential of technologies such as big data analytics,
   mobile internet, the internet of things and robotics. However, by far
   the biggest expected drivers of employment creation are demographic and
   socio-economic in nature; in particular, the opportunities offered by
   young demographics and rising middle classes in emerging markets and
   the rising economic power and aspirations of women. Conversely, the
   survey respondents predict that increasing geopolitical volatility
   risks are the biggest threat – by far – to employment and job creation
   globally.

   Regional Analysis

   At country level, expectations of the nature of upcoming disruptions
   are shaped by the demographic, economic and technological development
   of the country in question. Overall, changing and flexible work is seen
   as the most significant driver of change in advanced economies, whereas
   the rising middle class takes this role in emerging markets. New energy
   supplies and technologies are expected to play the largest role in the
   Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, while climate change
   adaptation is seen as a particularly major driver in Germany. A number
   of developing countries expect particularly large impact from the
   mobile internet given that the technology has the potential to bring
   millions of formerly unconnected workers and consumers into the formal
   economy for the first time.

   Skills instability – the rapid change in the skills requirements of all
   existing jobs – will also impact countries differently. While ASEAN,
   GCC and Japan will have only 25% instability in the top skills mix
   overall, in Turkey, China, India and Italy over 40% of the top skills
   required across all jobs will change in the next five years. In the
   United Kingdom, 28% of the top skills mix is expected to change by 2020
   while in the United States this number is expected to be 29%. In France
   (28%) and Germany (39%) the situation is even more challenging.

   Employment outlook is net positive in only five of the 15 countries
   covered, but even in those countries there is significant job churn –
   with some functions becoming redundant as new ones emerge. Using the
   forecasts from chief human resource officers and current employment
   data, the highest ratios of jobs created per job lost is expected to be
   in ASEAN (3.72 jobs gained per job lost), Mexico (3.06), United Kingdom
   (2.91), United States (1.37) and Turkey (1.14). In all other countries
   covered by the Future of Jobs report, there is an expected net loss in
   jobs.

   Industry and Occupation Analysis

   Drivers of change will also have a very disparate impact within
   specific industries. For example, new energy supplies and technologies
   will have a particular impact on Energy, Basic and Infrastructure, and
   Mobility. Processing power and big data will have an especially strong
   impact on Information and Communication Technology, Financial Services
   and Professional Services. The rising middle class in emerging markets
   will have the largest effect on Consumer, Financial Services and
   Mobility. Consumer ethics and privacy issues will have a significant
   impact on the Consumer, Financial Services and Information and
   Communication Technology sectors. The business model changes created by
   these drivers will, in turn, have specific and different consequences
   for employment and skills needs in each industry. While there is a
   modestly positive outlook for employment across most sectors over the
   2015-2020 period, underneath this aggregate outlook there is
   significant relative growth in some job families and significant
   relative decline in others.

   Skills instability is expected to impact all industries but is
   particularly pronounced in Financial Services where 43% of the top
   skills needed in all job families across the industry are expected to
   change by 2020. The next most affected industries are Basics and
   Infrastructure (42%) and Mobility (39%). The least affected by 2020 are
   Media, Entertainment and Information (27%) – unsurprisingly, as the
   industry is already in the midst of a major skills displacement – and
   Consumer industry (30%).

   The survey respondents expect strong employment growth across the
   Architecture and Engineering and Computer and Mathematical job
   families, a moderate decline in Manufacturing and Production roles and
   a significant decline in office and administrative roles. Other
   sizeable job families, such as Business and Financial Operations, Sales
   and Related and Construction and Extraction have a largely flat global
   employment outlook over the 2015-2020 period. However, across all job
   families, chief human resource officers expect major challenges in
   recruiting.

   Our research also explicitly asked respondents about new and emerging
   job categories and functions that they expect to become critically
   important to their industry by the year 2020, and where within their
   global operations they would expect to locate such roles. Two job types
   stand out due to the frequency and consistency with which they were
   mentioned across practically all industries and geographies. The first
   are data analysts, which companies expect will help them make sense of
   the torrent of data generated by the technological disruptions
   referenced above. The second are specialized sales representatives, as
   practically every industry will need to become skilled in
   commercializing and explaining their offerings to clients. Other new
   specialties frequently mentioned include new types of human resources
   and organizational development specialists, engineering specialties
   such as materials, biochemicals, nanotech and robotics, regulatory and
   government relations specialists, geospatial information systems
   experts, and commercial and industrial designers.

   The Case for Cooperation

   While forecasts vary by industry and region, momentous change is under
   way and, ultimately, it is our actions today that will determine
   whether that change mainly results in massive displacement of workers
   or the emergence of new opportunities.

   One of the major barriers to change identified by chief human resource
   officers is the lack of specificity on the types of disruptive change
   under way. Our dataset aims to bring specificity to the debate and to
   the options for action by providing the perspective of chief human
   resources officers of leading employers who are among those at the
   frontline of the emerging trends and are key actors in implementing
   future workforce strategies. “Our analysis reveals that upcoming
   disruptions to the employment landscape will be about much more than
   simply automation. It is essential that we act collectively now to
   prepare ourselves for the changes that we know the Fourth Industrial
   Revolution will bring,” said Saadia Zahidi, Head of the Global
   Challenge on Employment, Skills and Human Capital at the World Economic
   Forum.

   In part, this will entail business taking more responsibility for
   upskilling, reskilling and collaborating rather than competing on
   talent. In addition, it is imperative that governments put in place
   rapid and fundamental change in education systems to prepare for the
   new labour market. The World Economic Forum’s Global Challenge
   Initiative on Employment, Skills and Human Capital (see below) brings
   together businesses and governments to collaborate on making these
   solutions a reality.

   Methodology

   The Future of Jobs Survey that formed the basis of the report covers
   over 350 of the largest companies in the world, including over 150 of
   the Fortune Global 500. In addition to the individual company
   responses. we had over 1,300 detailed occupation-level data points on
   mass employment, specialist and newly emerging occupations based in
   specific geographic locations across these companies’ global
   operations. The survey respondents primarily included chief human
   resource officers, chief strategy officers and other senior talent and
   strategy executives. The target pool of respondents comprised, as the
   primary selection criterion, the 100 largest global employers in each
   of our target industry sectors. In addition to the aggregate analysis,
   the report contains 15 country or regional profiles and nine industry
   profiles providing detailed information for each on the current
   situation and the 2020 outlook.

   Global Challenge on Employment, Skills and Human Capital

   The World Economic Forum’s Global Challenge Initiative on Employment,
   Skills and Human Capital produces analytical tools such as the Human
   Capital Report, the Disrupting Unemployment compendium and the Future
   of Jobs report to allow companies and countries to benchmark their
   current performance, assess their prospects and learn from best
   practices. In addition, the Challenge Initiative serves as a platform
   for public-private partnerships to address skills gaps and prepare for
   the future of jobs in selected regions and countries. It cooperates
   with industries to analyse employment and skills needs and implement
   solutions, working closely with global multistakeholder communities of
   leaders and experts dedicated to boosting employment, closing skills
   gaps and improving education.

   Partners of the Global Challenge on Employment, Skills and Human
   Capital are: Adecco Group, African Rainbow Minerals, Alghanim
   Industries, AlixPartners, The Bahrain Economic Development Board,
