Luxury Watches

   Luxury watches are a source of fascination for people around the globe.
   But what qualifies as a luxury watch? Some may say it's any watch made
   of expensive materials such as gold or platinum. Others could argue
   that it has to be a mechanical watch with a handmade movement. Then
   there are those who define luxury based on legendary brands such as
   Rolex, Patek Philippe, and Breitling.
   Whatever it is you're looking for, you will find luxury watches from
   all the famous brands in every price range on Chrono24. Find and
   purchase your dream watch now.

Used Watches

   Not every watch has to come fresh from the factory. In fact, many
   people fall for the charm of watches with designs from the 60s or 70s.
   These vintage watches include coveted collector's items and hidden
   treasures waiting to be uncovered by watch fans. Here you will find
   both expensive rarities as well as legendary pieces whose predecessor
   models can be purchased at affordable prices.
   Searching for the right vintage watch is part of the overall shopping
   experience and often turns novices into watch aficionados.

Sell Watches

   Every month, over 7 million watch enthusiasts search for their next
   watch on Chrono24 – perhaps yours is the watch they are looking for?
   Create a free listing in a few simple steps and find a buyer for your
   watch.
   Once you've made a sale, the rest is easy: The buyer transfers the
   purchase price to a secure escrow account and then you ship the watch.
   Once it has arrived safely at its destination, you will receive payment
   into your bank account. We retain a small commission fee at the time of
   payout.
   Looking to free up some wrist space? Sell your watch now on Chrono24.

Buying a Watch

   Found your dream watch on Chrono24? Don't hesitate to make this dream a
   reality. The safest way to do so is via Trusted Checkout. You transfer
   the purchase price into an escrow account, and then the seller sends
   you your watch. We only pay out the sum to the seller when you have the
   watch in your hands.
   What's more: Purchases made via Trusted Checkout already include
   Chrono24's Buyer Protection and Authenticity Guarantee. If you pay the
   purchase price directly to the seller, you can still activate these
   services after the fact.
