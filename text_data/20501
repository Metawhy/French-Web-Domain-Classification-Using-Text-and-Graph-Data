Crafted in Partnership

   We paired world class game makers with Alaska Native storytellers and
   elders to create a game which delves deeply into the traditional lore
   of the Iñupiat people to present an experience like no other.

   Never Alone is our first title in an exciting new genre of “World
   Games” that draw fully upon the richness of unique cultures to create
   complex and fascinating game worlds for a global audience.
