   the ages of 2.5 – 6 years old. We have half-day program (8-1130am),
   full-day program (8-3pm) and after school program (3-6pm).

   Here’s the website if you want to find out more. Call me to schedule a

   A great big thank you for those of you who have followed me on this
   journey for the last few years. It’s finally becoming a reality!

Video: Grocery Shopping with 3-Year-Old Twins

   Monday, December 8th, 2014 1:16 pm | By Stephanie Woo

   Grocery Shopping with 3-Year-Old Twins

   Whenever I go grocery shopping, I always see children in strollers with
   iPads, food or toys while their parents are zipping through the aisles,
   picking out the necessities and checking out as fast as possible. Their
   aim is to get in and get out before the children start acting up. I
   know what that feels like, because I’ve done it plenty of times myself
   in crowded grocery stores with unforgiving fellow shoppers. In those
   cases, I always wished I had kept the children at home or shopped
   online.

   But if you’re lucky enough to have a grocery store nearby that doesn’t
   get too busy when you go – and you have a little bit of time to spare –
   then grocery shopping with them can be so much fun and educational.
   Having traveled from NYC, to Baltimore, to Denver, to Portland, to SF
   and to Taiwan, we’ve been to lots of grocery stores together. (New
   Seasons in Portland, OR is our favorite. The staff is extremely
   friendly and we always go during off-peak hours). What children can
   learn in a grocery store is endless: new vocabulary (Can you pick out
   the ‘turmeric,’ ‘chanterelle mushrooms’ and ‘fennel’?), counting and
   simple addition (“I need 8 mushrooms”), food culture (Is it local or
   organic?), sensorial exercise (How do you pick the juiciest grapefruit
   and the firmest onion?) grace and courtesy (What do you say when you
   bump into someone?) and so much more. But I think my favorite is
   self-control. How do you explain to children why we can’t buy down the
   whole chocolate aisle? (Try acknowledging their feeling, being firm and
   then redirecting: “I know you really want those cookies, but we are not
   buying those today. Hey, what’s over here? Look at these pretty
   flowers! Which ones should we buy to put on our dining room?” Or “We
   can’t buy those cookies today, but we can buy these!”)

   We took this video when B and M were 3 years 4 months. Mackenzie has
   always been more interested in helping to get groceries, but Brooke
   will also help. As a general rule, after I given them a task that they
   want to do, I only help when I know something is outside of their
   ability, like something is too heavy for them to carry. But even then,
   I wait and observe. I make sure they really need help, because children
   will surprise you. My goal is to help just enough, never more. If you
   find me buried in my iPhone or drinking my coffee – I’m doing my best
   not to look at them while they’re working. This ensures that I’m not
   giving any unnecessary help. I think (and hope) they have a lot of
   confidence in their abilities. Aside from encouraging them to do things
   they are interested in, even if it seems outside of the norm for a
   3-year-old, I also try to make sure the environment is set up in such a
   way that they will experience success. It takes a lot of quick thinking
   and ignoring stares from strangers, but watching their independence and
   confidence grow makes it worthwhile!
