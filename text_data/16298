Alerts

   Provide contextual feedback messages for typical user actions with the
   handful of available and flexible alert messages.

Examples

   Alerts are available for any length of text, as well as an optional
   dismiss button. For proper styling, use one of the eight required
   contextual classes (e.g., .alert-success). For inline dismissal, use
   the alerts jQuery plugin.
   A simple primary alert—check it out!
   A simple secondary alert—check it out!
   A simple success alert—check it out!
   A simple danger alert—check it out!
   A simple warning alert—check it out!
   A simple info alert—check it out!
   A simple light alert—check it out!
   A simple dark alert—check it out!
<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
  A simple primary alert—check it out!
</div>
<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
  A simple secondary alert—check it out!
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
  A simple success alert—check it out!
</div>
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  A simple danger alert—check it out!
</div>
<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  A simple warning alert—check it out!
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  A simple info alert—check it out!
</div>
<div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">
  A simple light alert—check it out!
</div>
<div class="alert alert-dark" role="alert">
  A simple dark alert—check it out!
</div>

Conveying meaning to assistive technologies

   Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which
   will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies – such as
   screen readers. Ensure that information denoted by the color is either
   obvious from the content itself (e.g. the visible text), or is included
   through alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the
   .sr-only class.

Link color

   Use the .alert-link utility class to quickly provide matching colored
   links within any alert.
   A simple primary alert with an example link. Give it a click if you
   like.
   A simple secondary alert with an example link. Give it a click if you
   like.
   A simple success alert with an example link. Give it a click if you
   like.
   A simple danger alert with an example link. Give it a click if you
   like.
   A simple warning alert with an example link. Give it a click if you
   like.
   A simple info alert with an example link. Give it a click if you like.
   A simple light alert with an example link. Give it a click if you like.
   A simple dark alert with an example link. Give it a click if you like.
<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
  A simple primary alert with <a href="#" class="alert-link">an example link</a>
. Give it a click if you like.
</div>
<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
  A simple secondary alert with <a href="#" class="alert-link">an example link</
a>. Give it a click if you like.
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
  A simple success alert with <a href="#" class="alert-link">an example link</a>
. Give it a click if you like.
</div>
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  A simple danger alert with <a href="#" class="alert-link">an example link</a>.
 Give it a click if you like.
</div>
<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  A simple warning alert with <a href="#" class="alert-link">an example link</a>
. Give it a click if you like.
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  A simple info alert with <a href="#" class="alert-link">an example link</a>. G
ive it a click if you like.
</div>
<div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">

</div>
<div class="alert alert-dark" role="alert">
  A simple dark alert with <a href="#" class="alert-link">an example link</a>. G
ive it a click if you like.
</div>

Additional content

   Alerts can also contain additional HTML elements like headings,
   paragraphs and dividers.

Well done!

   Aww yeah, you successfully read this important alert message. This
   example text is going to run a bit longer so that you can see how
   spacing within an alert works with this kind of content.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Whenever you need to, be sure to use margin utilities to keep things
   nice and tidy.
<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
  <h4 class="alert-heading">Well done!</h4>
  <p>Aww yeah, you successfully read this important alert message. This example
text is going to run a bit longer so that you can see how spacing within an aler
t works with this kind of content.</p>
  <hr>
  <p class="mb-0">Whenever you need to, be sure to use margin utilities to keep
things nice and tidy.</p>
</div>

Dismissing

   Using the alert JavaScript plugin, it’s possible to dismiss any alert
   inline. Here’s how:
     * Be sure you’ve loaded the alert plugin, or the compiled Bootstrap
       JavaScript.
     * If you’re building our JavaScript from source, it requires util.js.
       The compiled version includes this.
     * Add a dismiss button and the .alert-dismissible class, which adds
       extra padding to the right of the alert and positions the .close
       button.
     * On the dismiss button, add the data-dismiss="alert" attribute,
       which triggers the JavaScript functionality. Be sure to use the
       <button> element with it for proper behavior across all devices.
     * To animate alerts when dismissing them, be sure to add the .fade
       and .show classes.

   You can see this in action with a live demo:
   Holy guacamole! You should check in on some of those fields below.
   (BUTTON) ×
<div class="alert alert-warning alert-dismissible fade show" role="alert">
  <strong>Holy guacamole!</strong> You should check in on some of those fields b
elow.
  <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close">
    <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
  </button>
</div>

JavaScript behavior

Triggers

   Enable dismissal of an alert via JavaScript:
$('.alert').alert()

   Or with data attributes on a button within the alert, as demonstrated
   above:
<button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close">
  <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
</button>

   Note that closing an alert will remove it from the DOM.

Methods

   Method Description
   $().alert() Makes an alert listen for click events on descendant
   elements which have the data-dismiss="alert" attribute. (Not necessary
   when using the data-api’s auto-initialization.)
   $().alert('close') Closes an alert by removing it from the DOM. If the
   .fade and .show classes are present on the element, the alert will fade
   out before it is removed.
   $().alert('dispose') Destroys an element’s alert.
$('.alert').alert('close')

Events

   Bootstrap’s alert plugin exposes a few events for hooking into alert
   functionality.
   Event Description
   close.bs.alert This event fires immediately when the close instance
   method is called.
   closed.bs.alert This event is fired when the alert has been closed
   (will wait for CSS transitions to complete).
$('#myAlert').on('closed.bs.alert', function () {
  // do something...
})

Browsers and devices

   Learn about the browsers and devices, from modern to old, that are
   supported by Bootstrap, including known quirks and bugs for each.

Supported browsers

   Bootstrap supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers
   and platforms. On Windows, we support Internet Explorer 10-11 /
   Microsoft Edge.

   Alternative browsers which use the latest version of WebKit, Blink, or
   Gecko, whether directly or via the platform’s web view API, are not
   explicitly supported. However, Bootstrap should (in most cases) display
   and function correctly in these browsers as well. More specific support
   information is provided below.

Mobile devices

   Generally speaking, Bootstrap supports the latest versions of each
   major platform’s default browsers. Note that proxy browsers (such as
   Opera Mini, Opera Mobile’s Turbo mode, UC Browser Mini, Amazon Silk)
   are not supported.
   Chrome Firefox Safari Android Browser & WebView Microsoft Edge
   Android Supported Supported N/A Android v5.0+ supported Supported
   iOS Supported Supported Supported N/A Supported
   Windows 10 Mobile N/A N/A N/A N/A Supported

Desktop browsers

   Similarly, the latest versions of most desktop browsers are supported.
   Chrome Firefox Internet Explorer Microsoft Edge Opera Safari
   Mac Supported Supported N/A N/A Supported Supported
   Windows Supported Supported Supported, IE10+ Supported Supported Not
   supported

   For Firefox, in addition to the latest normal stable release, we also
   support the latest Extended Support Release (ESR) version of Firefox.

   Unofficially, Bootstrap should look and behave well enough in Chromium
   and Chrome for Linux, Firefox for Linux, and Internet Explorer 9,
   though they are not officially supported.

   For a list of some of the browser bugs that Bootstrap has to grapple
   with, see our Wall of browser bugs.

Internet Explorer

   Internet Explorer 10+ is supported; IE9 and down is not. Please be
   aware that some CSS3 properties and HTML5 elements are not fully
   supported in IE10, or require prefixed properties for full
   functionality. Visit Can I use… for details on browser support of CSS3
   and HTML5 features.

   If you require IE8-9 support, use Bootstrap 3. It’s the most stable
   version of our code and is still supported by our team for critical
   bugfixes and documentation changes. However, no new features will be
   added to it.

Modals and dropdowns on mobile

Overflow and scrolling

   Support for overflow: hidden; on the <body> element is quite limited in
   iOS and Android. To that end, when you scroll past the top or bottom of
   a modal in either of those devices’ browsers, the <body> content will
   begin to scroll. See Chrome bug #175502 (fixed in Chrome v40) and
   WebKit bug #153852.

iOS text fields and scrolling

   As of iOS 9.2, while a modal is open, if the initial touch of a scroll
   gesture is within the boundary of a textual <input> or a <textarea>,
   the <body> content underneath the modal will be scrolled instead of the
   modal itself. See WebKit bug #153856.

Navbar Dropdowns

   The .dropdown-backdrop element isn’t used on iOS in the nav because of
   the complexity of z-indexing. Thus, to close dropdowns in navbars, you
   must directly click the dropdown element (or any other element which
   will fire a click event in iOS).

Browser zooming

   Page zooming inevitably presents rendering artifacts in some
   components, both in Bootstrap and the rest of the web. Depending on the
   issue, we may be able to fix it (search first and then open an issue if
   need be). However, we tend to ignore these as they often have no direct
   solution other than hacky workarounds.

Sticky :hover/:focus on iOS

   While :hover isn’t possible on most touch devices, iOS emulates this
   behavior, resulting in “sticky” hover styles that persist after tapping
   one element. These hover styles are only removed when users tap another
   element. This behavior is considered largely undesirable and appears to
   not be an issue on Android or Windows devices.

   Throughout our v4 alpha and beta releases, we included incomplete and
   commented out code for opting into a media query shim that would
   disable hover styles in touch device browsers that emulate hovering.
   This work was never fully completed or enabled, but to avoid complete
   breakage, we’ve opted to deprecate this shim and keep the mixins as
   shortcuts for the pseudo-classes.

Printing

   Even in some modern browsers, printing can be quirky.

   As of Safari v8.0, use of the fixed-width .container class can cause
   Safari to use an unusually small font size when printing. See issue
   #14868 and WebKit bug #138192 for more details. One potential
   workaround is the following CSS:
@media print {
  .container {
    width: auto;
  }
}

Android stock browser

   Out of the box, Android 4.1 (and even some newer releases apparently)
   ship with the Browser app as the default web browser of choice (as
   opposed to Chrome). Unfortunately, the Browser app has lots of bugs and
   inconsistencies with CSS in general.

Select menu

   On <select> elements, the Android stock browser will not display the
   side controls if there is a border-radius and/or border applied. (See
   this StackOverflow question for details.) Use the snippet of code below
   to remove the offending CSS and render the <select> as an unstyled
   element on the Android stock browser. The user agent sniffing avoids
   interference with Chrome, Safari, and Mozilla browsers.
<script>
$(function () {
  var nua = navigator.userAgent
  var isAndroid = (nua.indexOf('Mozilla/5.0') > -1 && nua.indexOf('Android ') >
-1 && nua.indexOf('AppleWebKit') > -1 && nua.indexOf('Chrome') === -1)
  if (isAndroid) {
    $('select.form-control').removeClass('form-control').css('width', '100%')
  }
})
</script>

   Want to see an example? Check out this JS Bin demo.

Validators

   In order to provide the best possible experience to old and buggy
   browsers, Bootstrap uses CSS browser hacks in several places to target
   special CSS to certain browser versions in order to work around bugs in
   the browsers themselves. These hacks understandably cause CSS
   validators to complain that they are invalid. In a couple places, we
   also use bleeding-edge CSS features that aren’t yet fully standardized,
   but these are used purely for progressive enhancement.

   These validation warnings don’t matter in practice since the non-hacky
   portion of our CSS does fully validate and the hacky portions don’t
   interfere with the proper functioning of the non-hacky portion, hence
   why we deliberately ignore these particular warnings.

   Our HTML docs likewise have some trivial and inconsequential HTML
   validation warnings due to our inclusion of a workaround for a certain
   Firefox bug.

Alerts

   Provide contextual feedback messages for typical user actions with the
   handful of available and flexible alert messages.

Examples

   Alerts are available for any length of text, as well as an optional
   dismiss button. For proper styling, use one of the eight required
   contextual classes (e.g., .alert-success). For inline dismissal, use
   the alerts jQuery plugin.
   A simple primary alert—check it out!
   A simple secondary alert—check it out!
   A simple success alert—check it out!
   A simple danger alert—check it out!
   A simple warning alert—check it out!
   A simple info alert—check it out!
   A simple light alert—check it out!
   A simple dark alert—check it out!
<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
  A simple primary alert—check it out!
</div>
<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
  A simple secondary alert—check it out!
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
  A simple success alert—check it out!
</div>
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  A simple danger alert—check it out!
</div>
<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  A simple warning alert—check it out!
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  A simple info alert—check it out!
</div>
<div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">
  A simple light alert—check it out!
</div>
<div class="alert alert-dark" role="alert">
  A simple dark alert—check it out!
</div>

Conveying meaning to assistive technologies

   Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which
   will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies – such as
   screen readers. Ensure that information denoted by the color is either
   obvious from the content itself (e.g. the visible text), or is included
   through alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the
   .sr-only class.

Link color

   Use the .alert-link utility class to quickly provide matching colored
   links within any alert.
   A simple primary alert with an example link. Give it a click if you
   like.
   A simple secondary alert with an example link. Give it a click if you
   like.
   A simple success alert with an example link. Give it a click if you
   like.
   A simple danger alert with an example link. Give it a click if you
   like.
   A simple warning alert with an example link. Give it a click if you
   like.
   A simple info alert with an example link. Give it a click if you like.
   A simple light alert with an example link. Give it a click if you like.
   A simple dark alert with an example link. Give it a click if you like.
<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
  A simple primary alert with <a href="#" class="alert-link">an example link</a>
. Give it a click if you like.
</div>
<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
  A simple secondary alert with <a href="#" class="alert-link">an example link</
a>. Give it a click if you like.
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
  A simple success alert with <a href="#" class="alert-link">an example link</a>
. Give it a click if you like.
</div>
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  A simple danger alert with <a href="#" class="alert-link">an example link</a>.
 Give it a click if you like.
</div>
<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  A simple warning alert with <a href="#" class="alert-link">an example link</a>
. Give it a click if you like.
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  A simple info alert with <a href="#" class="alert-link">an example link</a>. G
ive it a click if you like.
</div>
<div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">

</div>
<div class="alert alert-dark" role="alert">
  A simple dark alert with <a href="#" class="alert-link">an example link</a>. G
ive it a click if you like.
</div>

Additional content

   Alerts can also contain additional HTML elements like headings,
   paragraphs and dividers.

Well done!

   Aww yeah, you successfully read this important alert message. This
   example text is going to run a bit longer so that you can see how
   spacing within an alert works with this kind of content.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Whenever you need to, be sure to use margin utilities to keep things
   nice and tidy.
<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
  <h4 class="alert-heading">Well done!</h4>
  <p>Aww yeah, you successfully read this important alert message. This example
text is going to run a bit longer so that you can see how spacing within an aler
t works with this kind of content.</p>
  <hr>
  <p class="mb-0">Whenever you need to, be sure to use margin utilities to keep
things nice and tidy.</p>
</div>

Dismissing

   Using the alert JavaScript plugin, it’s possible to dismiss any alert
   inline. Here’s how:
     * Be sure you’ve loaded the alert plugin, or the compiled Bootstrap
       JavaScript.
     * If you’re building our JavaScript from source, it requires util.js.
       The compiled version includes this.
     * Add a dismiss button and the .alert-dismissible class, which adds
       extra padding to the right of the alert and positions the .close
       button.
     * On the dismiss button, add the data-dismiss="alert" attribute,
       which triggers the JavaScript functionality. Be sure to use the
       <button> element with it for proper behavior across all devices.
     * To animate alerts when dismissing them, be sure to add the .fade
       and .show classes.

   You can see this in action with a live demo:
   Holy guacamole! You should check in on some of those fields below.
   (BUTTON) ×
<div class="alert alert-warning alert-dismissible fade show" role="alert">
  <strong>Holy guacamole!</strong> You should check in on some of those fields b
elow.
  <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close">
    <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
  </button>
</div>

JavaScript behavior

Triggers

   Enable dismissal of an alert via JavaScript:
$('.alert').alert()

   Or with data attributes on a button within the alert, as demonstrated
   above:
<button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close">
  <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
</button>

   Note that closing an alert will remove it from the DOM.

Methods

   Method Description
   $().alert() Makes an alert listen for click events on descendant
   elements which have the data-dismiss="alert" attribute. (Not necessary
   when using the data-api’s auto-initialization.)
   $().alert('close') Closes an alert by removing it from the DOM. If the
   .fade and .show classes are present on the element, the alert will fade
   out before it is removed.
   $().alert('dispose') Destroys an element’s alert.
$('.alert').alert('close')

Events

   Bootstrap’s alert plugin exposes a few events for hooking into alert
   functionality.
   Event Description
   close.bs.alert This event fires immediately when the close instance
   method is called.
   closed.bs.alert This event is fired when the alert has been closed
   (will wait for CSS transitions to complete).
$('#myAlert').on('closed.bs.alert', function () {
  // do something...
})

Browsers and devices

   Learn about the browsers and devices, from modern to old, that are
   supported by Bootstrap, including known quirks and bugs for each.

Supported browsers

   Bootstrap supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers
   and platforms. On Windows, we support Internet Explorer 10-11 /
   Microsoft Edge.

   Alternative browsers which use the latest version of WebKit, Blink, or
   Gecko, whether directly or via the platform’s web view API, are not
   explicitly supported. However, Bootstrap should (in most cases) display
   and function correctly in these browsers as well. More specific support
   information is provided below.

Mobile devices

   Generally speaking, Bootstrap supports the latest versions of each
   major platform’s default browsers. Note that proxy browsers (such as
   Opera Mini, Opera Mobile’s Turbo mode, UC Browser Mini, Amazon Silk)
   are not supported.
   Chrome Firefox Safari Android Browser & WebView Microsoft Edge
   Android Supported Supported N/A Android v5.0+ supported Supported
   iOS Supported Supported Supported N/A Supported
   Windows 10 Mobile N/A N/A N/A N/A Supported

Desktop browsers

   Similarly, the latest versions of most desktop browsers are supported.
   Chrome Firefox Internet Explorer Microsoft Edge Opera Safari
   Mac Supported Supported N/A N/A Supported Supported
   Windows Supported Supported Supported, IE10+ Supported Supported Not
   supported

   For Firefox, in addition to the latest normal stable release, we also
   support the latest Extended Support Release (ESR) version of Firefox.

   Unofficially, Bootstrap should look and behave well enough in Chromium
   and Chrome for Linux, Firefox for Linux, and Internet Explorer 9,
   though they are not officially supported.

   For a list of some of the browser bugs that Bootstrap has to grapple
   with, see our Wall of browser bugs.

Internet Explorer

   Internet Explorer 10+ is supported; IE9 and down is not. Please be
   aware that some CSS3 properties and HTML5 elements are not fully
   supported in IE10, or require prefixed properties for full
   functionality. Visit Can I use… for details on browser support of CSS3
   and HTML5 features.

   If you require IE8-9 support, use Bootstrap 3. It’s the most stable
   version of our code and is still supported by our team for critical
   bugfixes and documentation changes. However, no new features will be
   added to it.

Modals and dropdowns on mobile

Overflow and scrolling

   Support for overflow: hidden; on the <body> element is quite limited in
   iOS and Android. To that end, when you scroll past the top or bottom of
   a modal in either of those devices’ browsers, the <body> content will
   begin to scroll. See Chrome bug #175502 (fixed in Chrome v40) and
   WebKit bug #153852.

iOS text fields and scrolling

   As of iOS 9.2, while a modal is open, if the initial touch of a scroll
   gesture is within the boundary of a textual <input> or a <textarea>,
   the <body> content underneath the modal will be scrolled instead of the
   modal itself. See WebKit bug #153856.

Navbar Dropdowns

   The .dropdown-backdrop element isn’t used on iOS in the nav because of
   the complexity of z-indexing. Thus, to close dropdowns in navbars, you
   must directly click the dropdown element (or any other element which
   will fire a click event in iOS).

Browser zooming

   Page zooming inevitably presents rendering artifacts in some
   components, both in Bootstrap and the rest of the web. Depending on the
   issue, we may be able to fix it (search first and then open an issue if
   need be). However, we tend to ignore these as they often have no direct
   solution other than hacky workarounds.

Sticky :hover/:focus on iOS

   While :hover isn’t possible on most touch devices, iOS emulates this
   behavior, resulting in “sticky” hover styles that persist after tapping
   one element. These hover styles are only removed when users tap another
   element. This behavior is considered largely undesirable and appears to
   not be an issue on Android or Windows devices.

   Throughout our v4 alpha and beta releases, we included incomplete and
   commented out code for opting into a media query shim that would
   disable hover styles in touch device browsers that emulate hovering.
   This work was never fully completed or enabled, but to avoid complete
   breakage, we’ve opted to deprecate this shim and keep the mixins as
   shortcuts for the pseudo-classes.

Printing

   Even in some modern browsers, printing can be quirky.

   As of Safari v8.0, use of the fixed-width .container class can cause
   Safari to use an unusually small font size when printing. See issue
   #14868 and WebKit bug #138192 for more details. One potential
   workaround is the following CSS:
@media print {
  .container {
    width: auto;
  }
}

Android stock browser

   Out of the box, Android 4.1 (and even some newer releases apparently)
   ship with the Browser app as the default web browser of choice (as
   opposed to Chrome). Unfortunately, the Browser app has lots of bugs and
   inconsistencies with CSS in general.

Select menu

   On <select> elements, the Android stock browser will not display the
   side controls if there is a border-radius and/or border applied. (See
   this StackOverflow question for details.) Use the snippet of code below
   to remove the offending CSS and render the <select> as an unstyled
   element on the Android stock browser. The user agent sniffing avoids
   interference with Chrome, Safari, and Mozilla browsers.
<script>
$(function () {
  var nua = navigator.userAgent
  var isAndroid = (nua.indexOf('Mozilla/5.0') > -1 && nua.indexOf('Android ') >
-1 && nua.indexOf('AppleWebKit') > -1 && nua.indexOf('Chrome') === -1)
  if (isAndroid) {
    $('select.form-control').removeClass('form-control').css('width', '100%')
  }
})
</script>

   Want to see an example? Check out this JS Bin demo.

Validators

   In order to provide the best possible experience to old and buggy
   browsers, Bootstrap uses CSS browser hacks in several places to target
   special CSS to certain browser versions in order to work around bugs in
   the browsers themselves. These hacks understandably cause CSS
   validators to complain that they are invalid. In a couple places, we
   also use bleeding-edge CSS features that aren’t yet fully standardized,
   but these are used purely for progressive enhancement.

   These validation warnings don’t matter in practice since the non-hacky
   portion of our CSS does fully validate and the hacky portions don’t
   interfere with the proper functioning of the non-hacky portion, hence
   why we deliberately ignore these particular warnings.

   Our HTML docs likewise have some trivial and inconsequential HTML
   validation warnings due to our inclusion of a workaround for a certain
   Firefox bug.
