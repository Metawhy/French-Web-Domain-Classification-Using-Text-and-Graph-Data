Camden's Little Monster Bash!

   Welcome to my big view of Camden's Little Monster party!  It was a
   beautiful day for a party and we had lots of family, friends and 'lil'
   monsters' in attendance to join in the fun!

                                            [DSC_5992.JPG]
    I got the theme idea from the Hostess with the Mostess Blog, which I
            highly recommend for fun party ideas and inspiration!

   [DSC_5993.JPG]
   I made this banner for his first birthday and have used it every year
   since.

                                             [DSC_5989.JPG]
   The monsters were from the Little Monster Cricut cartridge.  I like any
                         excuse to use googly eyes!

                                             [DSC_5996.jpg]
    My sister, Emily, graciously helped me assemble the monsters and also
          found this monster pinata at Target!  What are the odds?

                                             [DSC_5997.jpg]
   Birthday hats are my favorite part of a kids party!  I bought these at
    Target and then cut the paper with Martha's starburst punch and stuck
    C's & 4's with stickers found at a Dollar store.  I bent the sparkly
     pipe cleaners in half and glued them in making them look like crazy
                           little monster antlers.

                               [DSC_6003.jpg]
               This turned out to be a big hit with the kids.!

                                            [DSC_6000.JPG]
      I cut extra monsters in larger sizes and then laid out pom pom's,
                  markers, glitter glue and more eyeballs!

   I only added this picture to show my spray tan mishap on my elbow!  So
                                    sexy.

Public Service Announcement - back it up baby!

   Hello! So, over the past few months I've been busy as a bee working on
   the re-design of our Lulubelles website {which should be ready for it's
   world wide launch later this month!! :-) yipee!}  As bad timing would
   have it, during the process of meeting deadlines, my computer hard
   drive crashed!  Gone-so.   AND I hadn't backed it up since December 11,
   2010 so I lost ALL of my pictures of Hadley's 1st birthday, Christmas,
   and the beginning months of the new year *tears*.  I'll use this time
   to insert my public service announcement - ALWAYS KEEP YOUR EXTERNAL
   HARD DRIVE PLUGGED IN AND SET FOR AUTOMATIC BACKUPS!  If you are a
   picture crazed person as I am, this is a devastating loss!  The folks
   at Apple replaced my hard drive and wrapped my old one up in a little
   coffin of sorts and sent me on my way.  The guy there said they
   actually aren't allowed to give back the old, broken hard drive but he
   felt sorry for me so slid it in my computer box...in hopes that I could
   take it to a doctor for reincarnation.   It couldn't have been the
   dramatic scene I created at Apple mourning the loss of my pictures that
   caused the pity!?!  If you are thinking "I can't leave it plugged in
   because I need to plug in my printer, camera, iphone charger,
   etc."...buy a USB hub.  This will give you more usb ports and will
   allow for a permanent home for your external hard drive.
   Shortly after 'the loss', I was going about my business trying to work
   extra fast in order to not delay the website and my computer popped up
   an error message with some technical jargon that basically said "your
   hard drive space is full and you can't do anything until you fix it".
   I started deleting stuff like crazy but nothing made a difference.  I
   then did some good ol' Google research and found a free application
   called Disc Inventory X which shows you exactly what files are taking
   up the most space and where they are located.  The big culprit for me
   was video!  I didn't even think I had taken that much home video, but
   it's such a space hog that a little takes up a lot.  So, I bought a new
   larger external hard drive and moved all of my video and photos to that
   and then a 2nd external hard drive is still plugged in at all times and
   backs up my computer hard drive and my video/photo hard drive.
   Something else I learned was that if you are a good girl and you do
   backup your computer, it's up to you to check how much space is left on
   your external hard drive.  If it fills up, it automatically starts
   deleting the oldest files - GASP - without asking your permission!
   That was a shocker to me.  To find out how much space yours has, find
   the icon (on a MAC, it's located at your left side bar) and right click
   on it then click 'get info' and it will tell you the capacity yours has
   and the availability.
   As I was doing my research it looked like there were a lot of people
   experiencing the same issues because of so many people using DSLR
   cameras, whose picture files are bigger than a traditional point and
   shoot camera, and taking more videos with their phones and smaller,
   more user friendly video cameras.  Because of this, I thought I'd share
   my story with you so that you can be proactive before you go through
   the major headaches that I have over the past couple of months!  So,
   the moral of the story is Back It Up Baby!!
   Xo,
   Natalie

My new camera lens!

   Happy February Friends!
   I've been having a lot of fun trying to improve my photography skills.
    Recently my sweet cousin Abigail, owner of Fleur de Lis Photography,
   was up for a visit and gave my sister and I a photography lesson.  We
   really enjoyed it but evidently my mom and cousin, Trenton, did not -
   they were both snoring on the couch 10 minutes into the 'lecture'!   We
   learned about such things as aperture, ISO and shutter speed.   If you
   are not into photography, you may already be asleep like our
   aforementioned family members!  Anyway, after the little lesson, I was
   ready to do my first photo session with my new, and long coveted, 50mm
   lens.   Here are the pictures from the shoot.
   [DSC_1239.JPG]
   Hadley was such a good little model for my shoot.

   This tiny little gold locket was mine when I was a baby.
   [DSC_1218.JPG]
   These little personalized bloomers were a gift from her Godmother,
   Gretchen.
   [DSC_1219.JPG]
   The end.
   If you have any good photography tips, I'd love to hear about them!  As
   always, thanks for checking in!
   xoxo, Natalie

About Me

   Natalie Olivia Gerlack
          Hello & welcome to my blog! I am an Account Executive for an IT
          services firm by day and the co-owner & designer of a
          hand-crafted jewelry business, Lulubelles, by night. I am also a
          Mother to two amazing kids – a toddler boy and infant girl. I
          LOVE them to pieces. I LOVE lots of ‘things’ too, like shopping
          for new stuff and old, at malls, boutiques or flea markets – I
          do not discriminate. ;-) I love creating, *making jewelry*,
          paper crafts - especially card making, and I buy pretty fabric
          with great intention of making many things. I love ruffles,
          sparkly things, purses, vintage finds, big jewelry, shoes,
          glitter, nail polish, home design, road trips, color, especially
          all shades of aqua, etc. etc….the list goes on and thus the name
          of my blog “Natalie Loves…” I hope you will join me as I type
          all about it!
