Welcome To Where’s The Jump?


   Where’s The Jump? is a movie jump scare database. Our aim is to
   provide a comprehensive listing of the jump scares in horror and
   thriller movies along with a short description of the scene and the
   time in the movie they occur.

   We give each movie a star rating based on the intensity and frequency
   of jump scares in the film. A movie with 4 or 5 stars suggests a
   seriously “jumpy” experience while a 0 star movie indicates a movie
   completely free of jump scares.

   We also have a collection of movie subtitle files available that will
   enable a warning message to display on screen shortly before a jump
   scare (requires a media player that supports .srt files). In most cases
   we try and use the blu-ray version of the film to derive our jump scare
   timings.

   Find a movie using the search bar at the top of the page or browse our
   full list of movies. You can also search by tag. If the movie you are
   looking for is not on our list please let us know and we will do our
   best to add it.
