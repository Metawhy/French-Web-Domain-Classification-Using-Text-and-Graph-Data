   More power to your Pi

   It’s been just over three weeks since we launched the new Raspberry Pi
   3 Model B+. Although the product is branded Raspberry Pi 3B+ and not
   Raspberry Pi 4, a serious amount of engineering was involved in
   creating it. The wireless networking, USB/Ethernet hub, on-board power
   supplies, and BCM2837 chip were all upgraded: together these … Continue

   And here it is in the flesh:

   Still a handsome devil

Raspberry Pi 4 memory options

   This is the first time we’re offering a choice of memory capacities.
   We’ve gone for the following price structure, retaining our signature
   $35 price for the entry-level model:
   RAM Retail price
   1GB $35
   2GB $45
   4GB $55

   As always these prices exclude sales tax, import duty (where
   appropriate), and shipping. All three variants are launching today: we
   have initially built more of the 2GB variant than of the others, and
   will adjust the mix over time as we discover which one is most popular.

New Raspberry Pi 4, new features

   At first glance, the Raspberry Pi 4 board looks very similar to our
   previous $35 products, all the way back to 2014’s Raspberry Pi 1B+.
   James worked hard to keep it this way, but for the first time he has
   made a small number of essential tweaks to the form factor to
   accommodate new features.

Power

   We’ve moved from USB micro-B to USB-C for our power connector. This
   supports an extra 500mA of current, ensuring we have a full 1.2A for
   downstream USB devices, even under heavy CPU load.

   An extra half amp, and USB OTG to boot

Video

   To accommodate dual display output within the existing board footprint,
   we’ve replaced the type-A (full-size) HDMI connector with a pair of
   type-D (micro) HDMI connectors.

   Seeing double

Ethernet and USB

   Our Gigabit Ethernet magjack has moved to the top right of the board,
   from the bottom right, greatly simplifying PCB routing. The 4-pin
   Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) connector remains in the same location, so
   Raspberry Pi 4 remains compatible with the PoE HAT.

   Through the looking glass

   The Ethernet controller on the main SoC is connected to an external
   Broadcom PHY over a dedicated RGMII link, providing full throughput.
   USB is provided via an external VLI controller, connected over a single
   PCI Express Gen 2 lane, and providing a total of 4Gbps of bandwidth,
   shared between the four ports.

   All three connectors on the right-hand side of the board overhang the
   edge by an additional millimetre, with the aim of simplifying case
   design. In all other respects, the connector and mounting hole layout
   remains the same, ensuring compatibility with existing HATs and other
   accessories.

New Raspbian software

   To support Raspberry Pi 4, we are shipping a radically overhauled
   operating system, based on the forthcoming Debian 10 Buster release.
   This brings numerous behind-the-scenes technical improvements, along
   with an extensively modernised user interface, and updated applications
   including the Chromium 74 web browser. Simon will take an in-depth look
   at the changes in tomorrow’s blog post, but for now, here’s a
   screenshot of it in action.

   Raspbian Buster desktop

   Some advice for those who are keen to get going with Raspbian Buster
   right away: we strongly recommend you download a new image, rather than
   upgrading an existing card. This ensures that you’re starting with a
   clean, working Buster system. If you really, really want to try
   upgrading, make a backup first.

   One notable step forward is that for Raspberry Pi 4, we are retiring
   the legacy graphics driver stack used on previous models. Instead,
   we’re using the Mesa “V3D” driver developed by Eric Anholt at Broadcom
   over the last five years. This offers many benefits, including
   OpenGL-accelerated web browsing and desktop composition, and the
   ability to run 3D applications in a window under X. It also eliminates
   roughly half of the lines of closed-source code in the platform.

New Raspberry Pi 4 accessories

   Connector and form-factor changes bring with them a requirement for new
   accessories. We’re sensitive to the fact that we’re requiring people to
   buy these: Mike and Austin have worked hard to source good-quality,
   cost-effective products for our reseller and licensee partners, and to
   find low-cost alternatives where possible.

Raspberry Pi 4 Case

   Gordon has been working with our design partners Kinneir Dufort and
   manufacturers T-Zero to develop an all-new two-part case, priced at $5.

   New toy, new toy box

   We’re very pleased with how this has turned out, but if you’d like to
   re-use one of our existing cases, you can simply cut away the plastic
   fins on the right-hand side and omit one of the side panels as shown
   below.

   Quick work with a Dremel

Raspberry Pi 4 Power Supply

   Good, low-cost USB-C power supplies (and USB-C cables) are surprisingly
   hard to find, as we discovered when sending out prototype units to
   alpha testers. So we worked with Ktec to develop a suitable 5V/3A power
   supply; this is priced at $8, and is available in UK (type G), European
   (type C), North American (type A) and Australian (type I) plug formats.

   Behold the marvel that is BS 1363

   If you’d like to re-use a Raspberry Pi 3 Official Power Supply, our
   resellers are offering a $1 adapter which converts from USB micro-B to
   USB-C. The thick wires and good load-step response of the old official
   supply make this a surprisingly competitive solution if you don’t need
   a full 3 amps.

   Somewhat less marvellous, but still good

Raspberry Pi 4 micro HDMI Cables

   Again, low-cost micro HDMI cables which reliably support the 6Gbps data
   rate needed for 4Kp60 video can be hard to find. We like the Amazon
   Basics cable, but we’ve also sourced a 1m cable, which will be
   available from our resellers for $5.

   Official micro HDMI to HDMI cable

Updated Raspberry Pi Beginner’s Guide

   At the end of last year, Raspberry Pi Press released the Official
   Raspberry Pi Beginner’s Guide. Gareth Halfacree has produced an updated
   version, covering the new features of Raspberry Pi 4 and our updated
   operating system.

New Raspberry Pi silicon

   Since we launched the original Raspberry Pi in 2012, all our products
   have been based on 40nm silicon, with performance improvements
   delivered by adding progressively larger in-order cores (Cortex-A7,
   Cortex-A53) to the original ARM11-based BCM2835 design. With BCM2837B0
   for Raspberry Pi 3B+ we reached the end of that particular road: we
   could no longer afford to toggle more transistors within our power
   budget.

   Raspberry Pi 4 is built around BCM2711, a complete re-implementation of
   BCM283X on 28nm. The power savings delivered by the smaller process
   geometry have allowed us to replace Cortex-A53 with the much more
   powerful, out-of-order, Cortex-A72 core; this can execute more
   instructions per clock, yielding performance increases over Raspberry
   Pi 3B+ of between two and four times, depending on the benchmark.

   We’ve taken advantage of the process change to overhaul many other
   elements of the design. We moved to a more modern memory technology,
   LPDDR4, tripling available bandwidth; we upgraded the entire display
   pipeline, including video decode, 3D graphics and display output to
   support 4Kp60 (or dual 4Kp30) throughput; and we addressed the
   non-multimedia I/O limitations of previous devices by adding on-board
   Gigabit Ethernet and PCI Express controllers.

Raspberry Pi 4 FAQs

   We’ll keep updating this list over the next couple of days, but here
   are a few to get you started.

   Wait, is it 2020 yet?

   In the past, we’ve indicated 2020 as a likely introduction date for
   Raspberry Pi 4. We budgeted time for four silicon revisions of BCM2711
   (A0, B0, C0, and C1); in comparison, we ship BCM2835C2 (the fifth
   revision of that design) on Raspberry Pi 1 and Zero.

   Fortunately, 2711B0 has turned out to be production-ready, which has
   taken roughly 9–12 months out of the schedule.

   Are you discontinuing earlier Raspberry Pi models?

   No. We have a lot of industrial customers who will want to stick with
   the existing products for the time being. We’ll keep building these
   models for as long as there’s demand. Raspberry Pi 1B+, 2B, 3B, and 3B+
   will continue to sell for $25, $35, $35, and $35 respectively.

   What about a Model A version?

   Historically, we’ve produced cut-down, lower-cost, versions of some of
   our $35 products, including Model 1A+ in 2014, and Model 3A+ at the end
   of last year. At present we haven’t identified a sensible set of
   changes to allow us to do a “Model 4A” product at significantly less
   than $35. We’ll keep looking though.

   What about the Compute Module?

   CM1, CM3, and CM3+ will continue to be available. We are evaluating
   options for producing a Compute Module product based on the Raspberry
   Pi 4 chipset.

   Are you still using VideoCore?

   Yes. VideoCore 3D is the only publicly documented 3D graphics core for
   ARM‑based SoCs, and we want to make Raspberry Pi more open over time,
   not less.

Credits

   A project like Raspberry Pi 4 is the work of many hundreds of people,
   and we always try to acknowledge some of those people here.

   This time round, particular credit is due to James Adams, who designed
   the board itself (you’ll find his signature under the USB 3.0 socket);
   to Mike Buffham, who ran the commercial operation, working with
   suppliers, licensees, and resellers to bring our most complicated
   product yet to market; and to all those at Raspberry Pi and Broadcom
   who have worked tirelessly to make this product a reality over the last
   few years.

   A partial list of others who made major direct contributions to the
   BCM2711 chip program, CYW43455, VL805, and MxL7704 integrations, DRAM

       Congratulations. Amazing achievement to pack so many features in an
       retain the $35 price point for the base model.

            Correct me if I’m wrong, but it appears to cost $120, not $35.
            I was super-excited when I learned of the Pi 4, but at that
            price, it’s not really in a competitive league with the 3 B+.
            Still certainly more impressive bang-for-buck than the NanoPi,
            FriendlyARM or Libre.
            The 3 B+ and Zero W are fun because you can buy a bunch of
            them and tinker with different things at once. At $120, I
            probably would only buy one, and I’d want to make certain that
            I had something in mind that would make it worthwhile. Not
            really a “tinker” price point anymore.
            If you’re creating Internets of Thing, $120 will also eat into
            your margins.

                 You’re wrong, happily! You’re looking at the Desktop Kit,
                 not the computer on its own. That includes keyboard,
                 mouse, cables, a book, case and SD card.

                      Technically speaking, for 95% of the users, the
                      lowest cost is about $50 to $55. They admit a new
                      power adapter had to be manufactured and most people
                      will also have to purchase mini hmdi cable.
                      There was no need to go to double mini hdmi, they
                      should make a single standard hdmi version.

                           Doesn’t segmentation of the market with more
                           variants typically mean higher manufacturing
                           and logistics costs, though? $250-350 laptops
                           ship with the same CPU and 2-3 storage/RAM
                           variants, while the ones that allow you to
                           individually choose the CPU, GPU, RAM, and
                           storage start at $50-100 more, even if you get
                           the exact same spec from the cheap model. The
                           cheapest economy car brands have 2-3 trim
                           levels, 4-5 colors that all come with one
                           interior color, and almost no separate
                           packages, while Toyota, Honda, and Mazda have
                           3-7 trims with several packages and multiple
                           engines, and let you mix-and-match interior
                           color, paint, and wheels, but in exchange for
                           the freedom of choice, you get $3-5k less for
                           your money. Kind bars give you less bar for
                           twice the money than the ones at the grocery
                           store checkout line, because you get to choose
                           from about 100 flavors instead of 5.
                           Personally, I’d rather have a 4B
                           double-mini-HDMI version for $35, then a 4A
                           single-HDMI version for $35 with the
                           double-mini 4B costing $40-45. Yes, that gap is
                           about made up with the cost of the cables, but
                           you’d have to buy the cables either way, which
                           would raise the cost to get a usable 4B by yet
                           another $5-10. They also wouldn’t be able to
                           offer 3 RAM variants in the same model if their
                           differentiation budget was spend on having 2-3
                           completely different models, so you’d only be
                           able to get a 4A with 1GB and a 4B with 4GB at
                           $55; even if there were a $40-45 2GB version it
                           would almost certainly be mini-HDMI only.

                 Ah, but you have forgotten Moore’s law: “[T]he principle
                 that the speed and capability of computers can be
                 expected to double every two years, as a result of
                 increases in the number of transistors a microchip can
                 contain.” This also means that processors and computers
                 will have 50% price-cut as their technology becomes
                 easier to produce.
                 The best part is that the RPi 4 is the same size as as a
                 normal RPi! You can fit the same number of Pi’s in your
                 Pi-server with 4X the power!

            No for mainly the same reason as before: the OS standard
            Raspbian image needs to be backwards compatible with the older
            Pi versions, and therefore isn’t 64 bit.

                      No, 4GB is the largest size which can be accessed
                      with a 32-bit address. 2^32 = 4GB.

                           It is, yes, but on the Pi, video RAM is part of
                           the same physical RAM device anyway – the
                           system memory is split between CPU and GPU
                           memory. Memory available to the CPU is whatever
                           is left after the GPU has taken what it needs…

                           Does the Pi 4 SoC/Raspbian support ARM’s LPAE
                           to extend memory access? As otherwise wouldn’t
                           a 32-bit OS be stuck with access to just the
                           first 3.2GB of that 4GB?

                 Unfortunately too much of a focus on backwards
                 compatibility can be a bad thing! I’d much rather see
                 plan that puts this board into the 64 bit OS space. The
                 reason is pretty simple 2-4 years down the road when PI5
                 comes out, and it has 6-8 GB of RAM you will really want
                 a 64 bit OS and nobody else Will be demanding 32 bit
                 support. At least nobody with any sense.
                 To put it another way the transition has to be made at
                 some point in time and this looks like the ideal board to
                 do that on. This especially when you continue to sell the
                 32 bit platforms. It literally takes years to get to the
                 point of a 64 bit only distro that is fully fleshed out.

                      We cannot avoid focussing on backwards
                      compatibility; it may not matter to you, but it is
                      massively important to us. There are 27 million Pis
                      in the wild; I don’t have exact numbers to hand for
                      how many of those are Pis 1, 2 and Zero, but it’s
                      well over 10 million of them. As soon as we move to
                      a 64-bit OS, those devices are orphaned, because we
                      do not have the resource to maintain two separate
                      forks of Raspbian. (Not to mention to handle the
                      support requests we will get from the thousands of
                      users who download the wrong version and find it
                      doesn’t boot.)
                      No-one has yet managed to provide us with a
                      convincing use-case for where a 64-bit OS actually
                      provides a real, quantifiable benefit to end-users.
                      32-bit accesses the entire RAM of the 4GB Pi 4.
                      64-bit code is invariably larger than 32-bit code –
                      compare the sizes of the 32-bit and 64-bit versions
                      of Windows 7; the 64-bit version is 30-40% larger.
                      That’s a lot of extra download bandwidth for us, and
                      for our users. A lot of 64-bit code actually runs
                      slower than the 32-bit equivalent – because it’s
                      larger, it takes longer to pull in from backing
                      store. There are numerous costs attached to 64-bit –
                      and we have yet to find a proven use-case where it
                      actually offers any benefit whatsoever to the vast
                      majority of our user base.
                      So no, this is not the ideal platform for the
                      transition, or the time to make it. When (and if) we
                      have a board that has more than 4GB of RAM – and
                      that is likely to be a good few years off from
                      today’s launch – we will look at 64-bit. But until
                      then, the advantages of 32-bit – backwards
                      compatibility, size, speed; of which backwards
                      compatibility is easily the largest – vastly
                      outweigh the putative advantages of a move to 64-bit
                      at this point in time.

                           Thanks for keeping the backwards compatibility!
                           I agree on the 32 bit decision. I think that
                           people have this theory that a $35 (or with all
                           the memory a $55) computer should be able
                           process a huge amount of data and code.
                           Your market of reaching out to new programmers
                           and the learning aspects don’t need a 64 bit
                           world. I’ve found the Pi to be able to do
                           everything I wanted. When it starts to stumble,
                           I split the load off and provision a new Pi.
                           Most of mine run headless, so it’s not like
                           it’s a big deal.
                           If you need to run data center level of
                           production, the Pi isn’t really anyone’s first
                           choice.
                           Thanks for the upgrades, and thanks again for
                           keeping my entire ecosystem looking forward
                           with the stick to 32 bits.

                      While I agree that sometimes keeping backward
                      compatibility is necessary, doing it can be a
                      disastrous business decision. Software development
                      is the most expensive item these days, nobody wants
                      to recompile and re-tests their applications, that
                      cost money and time. I believe the RPI Foundation is
                      doing the right thing by keeping everything backward
                      compatible until the 64 bit killer app for the RPI4
                      appears.
                      And, in any case, there will be plenty of 64bit
                      Linux distros that will happily run on the RPI 4.

                      Industry seems to be one of the main markets for
                      SBC’s they NEED long term support, 32-bit does the
                      job, and as said 64 is needless bloat for a platform
                      like this.
                      Still there are other distro’s that can be run on
                      Pi, as it supports 64-bit you get best of both

            Yes camera and display are the same as older Pis so existing
            peripherals will work fine. USB-C is connected to a separate
            USB2 OTG controller in the BCM2711 SoC so can be used as a
            host or device.

                 We’re looking at it. The ultimate limitation (at least
                 for video) is the data rate we can squeeze over the
                 2-lane MIPI interface on the camera connector; this
                 hasn’t been significantly increased with the new SoC.

            At present we only support booting from SD card. We will
            support booting from USB and network in due course via an
            upgrade to the onboard SPI Flash.
            Your best bet for a root filesystem is a good USB3 SSD. The
            performance delta over SD card is very noticeable.

       I understand why it doesn’t have a SATA-port, but why not have an

       Yes I know, more wants more, but SD cards are really bad for heavy

       eMMC storage modules don’t easily get corrupted like SD cards, so

            With the USB3 ports you can get 1Gbps throughput for an SSD —
            four times faster than eMMC (according to a cursory Google).
            It’s not on-board of course, but you can boot from it.

                 Point is that an onboard eMMC header would be very nice
                 for embedded solutions. This is for similar reasons why
                 people ask for an onboard SATA port.
                 The main benefit of having a small eMMC storage module
                 compared to a SATA SSD hard drive when large storage is
                 not needed is the size, and another is power usage for
                 battery-powered solutions.
                 Having an onboard eMMC header would be a more embedded
                 experience when large storage is not needed.

            HEVC decode is 10-bit. The HDMI output in theory does up to
            12-bit colourspaces with rec.2100 and HLG support, but there’s
            likely to be a few unintended software barriers (bugs) between
            your HDR content and the screen.

            There is a new blog post on libreelec.tv that state that the
            Raspberry Pi 4B hardware is HDR capable, but software support
            has dependencies that will be released in Linux 5.2 Kernel.
            That blog post also states that LibreELEC and Kodi developers
            have been working with the Raspberry Pi Foundation staff on
            this and more media playback related features for the past
            6-months.
            Another new media playback related feature includes support
            for H.264 decode in 1080p @ 60fps, and working is also being
            done to possible in the future support HBR audio
            (TrueHD/DTS-HD), as well as future support for “3D video”
            which I assume must mean either mean support for HEVC 3D MVC
            (Multiview Video Coding) since there already is support for
            H.264 3D MVC on Raspberry Pi 3 and 3B+

            HDR support is critical for making the Raspberry Pi 4 the
            go-to choice for 4K media centers. As it stands, all options
            out there that are 4K + HDR are typically $250 or more.

       Great job, I always liked the Raspberry Pi but with some things it
       shows that the Pi 3 is a old for its age. The only questions I have
       is if there is a 64 bit os version. It would be a shame if not. And
       the other question is WHY MICRO HDMI. Why. I liked the pi for not
       having to use dongles or special adapters.

            There is no 64bit OS yet. The Raspbian image has to be
            backward compatible. We are assured that 64bits is being
            developed and I for one hope it will be available before too
            long, but I’m a tech nerd. In fact there is no great need for
            it. The only advantages are accessing more than 4GB of RAM and
            allowing 64-bit programs. Other than that it makes the OS less
            efficient. Pointers are bigger and require more memory
            addressing, caching becomes less efficient. Only programs that
            use more than 4GB of virtual memory or use a lot of 64bit data
            would profit.
            There’s only so much space on the board, so if you want two
            HDMI connectors, something has to give. The cable is only $5.
            I can live with that.

                 Compatibility is a good reason to do an 64bit os anyway.
                 The 64bit arm support is a little more general then
                 32bit, and its gaining traction fast. I’ve seen some
                 projects build only 64bit arm binaries at this point.
                 I’ve started doing 64bit only myself when I can, so I
                 don’t need to do 32bit for some machines, and 64 for
                 others.

                 Getting to 64 bit is more about the long game than any
                 specific need. It amounts to prep for the future as much
                 as it solves current problems. I would imagine that in
                 2-4 years(maybe a bit longer) PI 5 will come out with 6-8
                 GB of RAM. If we started now on a 64 bit Raspian it would
                 be fully ready for that new world.
                 Frankly when it comes to arguments about 32 bit or 64 bit
                 operating systems I’ve never have seen a good reason to
                 maintain backward compatibility. Backward compatibility
                 is taken care of via PI3’s and earlier products. Now that
                 we have really good 64 bit hardware a transition would
                 make a lot of sense.
                 As for 64 bit data I suspect that there is much happening
                 in this realm as improving hardware means less of a
                 penalty to use that data. Again it is the idea of looking
                 towards the future as opposed to the past. Of course 64
                 bit data isn’t a problem on older 32 bit hardware but you
                 have to admit that 64 bit hardware available today is far
                 better at handling that data than in the past. Often the
                 scare tactics with respect to 64 bit pointers taking up
                 lots of memory are revealed to be very application
                 dependent. Often the efficiency of the 64 bit hardware
                 makes the impact a wash.
                 To look at this another way look at the mess created in
                 the Python world buy guys that failed to move forward.
                 Sure the transition to Python 3 created work for
                 developers but that work paid off over the long run with
                 much better and cleaner code. I wouldn’t expect a
                 transition to 64 bit on PI 4 to take anywhere near as
                 long but a clean transition point would eliminate a lot
                 of problems in the I86 world where 32 bit has become a
                 ball and chain for developers, distros and even users.
                 I have this live /hate relationship with Apple but the
                 one thing they have done right is to push developers real
                 hard in the direction of 64 bit apps. They clearly
                 defined when the 32 but world would come to an end. This
                 has been very positive for the platform.

                      Pi 3 and earlier products do not “take care” of
                      backward compatibility – they are the reason we want
                      to maintain it! We do not want to do what certain
                      other computer manufacturers have done (such as the
                      one you mention below…) and deliberately cut off
                      older hardware unless there is an actual requirement
                      to do so. Pi’s low price point is one of our key
                      USPs. If we then turn around to people a couple of
                      years on and say “ah – sorry – your hardware doesn’t
                      work with the new software; guess you’ll need to buy
                      some more”, we significantly weaken that point. You
                      may be able to afford to replace your hardware every
                      time we release an update, but significant
                      proportions of our user base – the education market;
                      developing nations; industrial users – cannot.
                      And to misquote you – frankly, when it comes to
                      arguments about 32 bit or 64 bit operating systems,
                      I’ve never yet seen a good reason for moving Pi to
                      64-bit, other than 64-bit is newer and bigger so it
                      must be better. We’ve asked people to provide
                      use-cases where 64-bit shows a significant
                      quantifiable difference in performance on a
                      commonly-used application, but so far, such things
                      have been conspicuous by their absence.
                      “I have this live /hate relationship with Apple but

                      For the platform, maybe. For users, not so much. I
                      still run iOS 10 on all my devices, because I have
                      several 32-bit apps for which the developer has now
                      vanished and there is no 64-bit equivalent. I know
                      several other iOS users in the same position – stuck
                      on an old version of the OS because Apple
                      arbitrarily decided to dump support for applications
                      and code that worked perfectly well.

                           Snap! My home Mac is a 2010 Mac Mini – still on
                           Yosemite. With an SSD instead of the (very
                           slow) HDD supplied by Apple, and 8GB of RAM,
                           it’s still, like yours, perfectly usable on a

                           Then Apple didn’t handle it well. Both Linux
                           and Windows can handle 32-bit applications in
                           64-bit mode. It’s the OS that wouldn’t be
                           backward compatible, not the applications.
                           It is, of course, a major advantage of the
                           RaspPi that there is one OS image that works in
                           every board. But it wouldn’t be entirely
                           horrible to have two builds.
                           As for a convincing use-case, you’ve got 19

            There might not be a Raspbian image, but you can surely use a
            64-bit OS if you need it — I understand the RPI4 will boot the
            Debian unofficial preview image for the RPI3 I produced —
            https://wiki.debian.org/RaspberryPi3
            If not, well, please wait a month or so. I will get my hands
            on a RPI4 by mid July, and expect to hack on it during
            DebConf, so by early August we should be able to boot it, no
            matter what! :-]

            In theory yes, but not currently.
            The hardware has 3 composition channels, however the third one
            has always been reserved for offscreen composition to memory
            (potentially with transpose) rather than onscreen composition.
            Removing that assumption would be a significant amount of work
            in the firmware, so is likely to be left until we have the
            fullly open KMS driver sorted (and I’m not sure how easy it is
            to do there either).

                 Actually I’ve just gone through the demos in
                 /opt/vc/src/hello_pi with the new GL driver enabled and
                 none seem to work (well hello_world does). However the
                 the raspberrypi org documentation usage demos claims that
                 they work apart from hello_triangle and hello_teapot
                 which will fail on RPi4.
                 So, obviously someone’s recently gone through and updated
                 the documentation, but they haven’t added any hints about
                 how to make the demos work with the new driver.
                 Given the enormous number of credits for the launch of
                 the RPi I would have thought it was relatively trivial
                 for someone to take a few minutes to update
                 /opt/vc/src/hello_pi code!!

                      You have assumed it’s a trivial change, I’m not sure

                      all there was time for. If you want to provide a PR

                           Sorry James, I was being needlessly fatuous. If
                           I really thought it was easy I wouldn’t be
                           asking for someone else to do it!
                           I have been intending to sort out a version of
                           pi3d using more portable wrappers such as SDL2
                           for ages and this is just the kick I need to
                           get it fixed! – once I’ve got the python module
                           working I’ll see if I can do a patch for the
                           hello_pi examples.

       It would be good if you could bring down idle power draw again in
       future designs. Having extra oomph on demand is good, but for
       battery and off-grid power, being able to turn the wick right down
       at other times is magic.

       Very, very impressive, well done team! I was thinking about a
       Nvidia Jetson Nano Developer Kit for more power, but now I get that
       extra power on my preferred platform. New possibilities are there
       to explore!

            The big difference will be in the GPU; the Jetson Nano has a
            128 core Maxwell GPU, which is going to give you a lot more
            compute power and it comes standard with 4GB of RAM. It’s
            pretty impressive for AI/ML operations from the experiments
            with it I’ve run so far.
            However as a general-purpose device, this is quite the deal
            and the video improvements alone are fantastic, especially
            keeping the price still this low

            compatible switch. No need for multiple cables. The full

            I don’t believe there is any limit. Pi3 is reported as working
            with 256G sdcards and there are no additional limitations with
            Pi4.
            The FAT partition on raspbian is only 256M so there is no
            issue there with a raspbian image.

       Congratulations folks, what a surprise this morning !
       Very very impressed by the choice of 4*A72, it’s a good choice and
       surprise ! I was afraid of seeing 8*A53 like many manufacturers,
       but I rather prefer less powerful cores than more light ones ! Big
       congratulations for this point !
       Almost all limitations are gone (single USB2 line, DDR2 1G limit,
       etc…) within the same price point ! Impressed, really.
       The USB C OTG would allow SD-less configurations and interesting
       hacks, I hope.
       This Raspberry Pi is really a brand new model. I hope the
       compatibility won’t be a problem for previous models.
       Now, we want more details about your choices, the process and story
       about this Raspberry Pi 4 (and this mysterious VideoCore VI) !!!

       Well done on an great product – it looks to have solved so many of
       the niggles which people have been asking for – true Gigabit
       ethernet and full USB3 rates. Brilliant – thank you.
       That said, the UK pricing of 2GB/4GB variants at UK resellers
       (Pimoroni and PiHut) seems off, **even taking VAT into account**.
       Current $/£ direct exchange (currently $1 = £0.79 according to
       Google):
       1GB: $35 = £27.48. Add VAT (20%) = £32.98. UK resellers = £34. No
       complaint, seems fine, even £35 may be reasonable.
       2GB: $40 = £31.40. Add VAT (20%) = £37.68 (about £5 more than 1GB).
       UK resellers = £44 (£10 more than 1GB). Seems at least £5 mark-up
       from $40 advertised on blog.
       4GB: $45 = £35.33. Add VAT (20%) = £42.40 (about £10 more than 1GB)
       . UK resellers = £54 (£20 more than 1GB). Again, at least £10
       mark-up (from $45 advertised on blog.
       So, even accounting for VAT, the UK pricing actually doubles the
       difference in price between higher models, which means (after
       removing VAT again) the 2GB version is more like $45, with 4GB
       version more like $55.
       It’s the disconnect between the 2GB/4GB variants, when the 1GB
       variant is bang on $:£ + VAT conversion which I’m questioning. Of
       course, retailers are free to sell for whatever price they want,
       but other than that 1GB headliner, they don’t seem to match the
       advertised $ prices, even with VAT included.

       How much is the typical idle and maximum power consumption of the
       1/2/4 GB variants when nothing is attached to the Pi (over USB,
       HDMI, etc.)? Theoretically the 5V/3A power supply could allow for a
       15W maximum consumption, but I’m guessing that with no peripherals
       the maximum consumption (even at full CPU load) should be much
       lower. And the typical idle power consumption should be even lower.

       The current Pi 3b+ can boot from an USB Mass Storage device, I
       assume that will also work on the new Pi4, but is booting also
       supported over the USB 3.0 ports?
       (as these use the external VIA USB 3.0 controller)

            USB and network booting are not ready today but will come.
            (The SPI boot eprom means new boot modes can be added without
            an sdcard inserted, or hardware updates).

            The answer to this is, really, since VAT has been set at 20%.
            As Eben writes above, “these prices exclude sales tax, import
            duty (where appropriate), and shipping”. Because Raspberry Pi
            products are sold around the world, and taxes and duties vary
            greatly, it’s not possible to quote any single meaningful
            price that includes tax.

            Instead of about the weakness in their security that allowed a

       The new Raspberry Pi 4B looks great and I have already ordered a
       4GB version from Pimoroni. Given the higher power consumption and
       hence heat needing to be dissipated reported in the reviews, will
       there be an official Raspberry Pi case that includes a mounting
       space for a cooling fan as this would seem very desirable for the
       4B? I have a 3B+ running quite hard in a (not official Raspberry
       Pi) case with a fan which drops the temperature around 20 degrees.
       Thanks.

            H265 with low latency is very difficult!

                 Has the h.264 encoding and decoding maybe become a bit
                 faster with the newer hardware?
                 Currently, the “glass-to-glass” (i.e. encode on Pi with
                 Pi Cam, transmit over wireless, decode on another Pi)
                 latency achievable with 720p 48fps video is about 125ms,
                 would be nice if some milliseconds could be shaved off.

            No, because just like the previous models this Pi doesn’t have
            a proper storage interface either. Until the RPis come with
            something else than USB/SD storage they will offer only a slow
            and somewhat infuriating experience in terms of typical
            everyday desktop computer tasks.

                 With a Raspberry Pi 4, there is nothing stopping you from
                 using a desktop 2.5″ SSD with a USB3.0-SATA adapter and
                 getting 330MB/s read/write performance. If you really
                 need it. Which you don’t for web browsing – because
                 previously that has been exclusively RAM and CPU limited.

                      You do, unless you want to disable all caching and
                      request a million files everytime you revisit this
                      or that webpage. It is most definitely dependant on
                      quickly issuing many separate write tasks, which USB
                      and flash drives are bad at.

                      You don’t understand the modern web or the massive
                      number of auxillary files involved in it these days.
                      The web isn’t a single big file, anywhere, and web
                      browsers don’t cache resources in RAM. Sure, you do
                      need a somewhat snappy processor and some decent
                      amount of RAM for a modern browser, but even older
                      RPis were entirely sufficient in this territory.
                      What’s stalling is the storage; SD’s (and USB mass
                      storage’s) inability to do lots of small writes
                      quickly.
                      I get that you’re advocating for the RPi and want to
                      defend it, but being ignorant about its shortcomings
                      and trying to rationalize around them isn’t doing it
                      or the community a favor. Instead, be vocal about it
                      so that the RPi foundation hears you … or we’ll just
                      keep getting one more board after the other, to
                      build yet another useless file server with.

                           Absolutely right!
                           Having decided almost two years ago to use my
                           Pi 3B as my everyday desktop I at first saw it
                           freeze regularly for a couple of seconds during
                           web browsing while the CPU was idling. I nailed
                           it down to a lot (a LOT) of Chromium’s small
                           writes at the local cache folder. Kept the SD
                           just for boot, and switched to a spare HDD at
                           first, then a 240GB SSD. Even with the HDD it
                           became obvious that the SD was a major
                           bottleneck. Everything now loaded at a snap and
                           cache or other writes were now transparent to
                           me. Everything, from browsing to Mathematica
                           was responsive and usable, until of course the
                           CPU or RAM topped out. I can only imagine how
                           much faster the new setup will be, with a
                           snappier CPU, 4GB, and an SSD connected via
                           USB3.
                           Seriously though, to all the people complaining
                           about the SD card, would you run your PC OS
                           from such a medium? Using it was a decision of
                           least cost, not a strategy for performance. So
                           switch to an SSD. They’re dirt cheap these days
                           and they work wonders.

                           Browsers don’t cache resources in RAM? Sorry,
                           but Firefox can be configured to do exactly
                           that. You can force Frefox to have your
                           complete cache in RAM. And, by the way, the
                           cache isn’t that useful, because its contents
                           expire very fast. I have compeltely turned off

            I just put Buster on a brand new Samsung SD card and, to be
            fair (and maybe it’s my imagination), Chromium seems to be
            more responsive on a 3B+. I did see a benchmark on the web
            that indicated at least a 2X browsing improvement with a 4 so
            I am looking forward to that.
            Hats off to the RPi team – this is another quantum leap
            forward for the HW design. And, as an EE, I am amazed that
            they continue to hold to the $35 price point.

       I was so impressed by what I read, that I placed an order for the
       ‘starter kit'(which included the new case & power supply as well!)
       at about 9 am, and was surprised and delighted to receive an email
       from them less than one hour later advising me that my order was
       already on its way to me.

                 Sure, if 99% of users don’t want to use the Pi as a
                 replacement for a general-use PC. I don’t think 99% is an
                 accurate number for this. I don’t think even 75% is.
                 At the very least I’d like to see an eMMC slot, ideally a
                 plain standard SATA or M.2 connector. USB and SD are
                 totally OK for reading from, but insufferably slow when
                 it comes to writing anything but one long sequential
                 amount of data. This type of storage use isn’t the case
                 for any normal use of an operating system, and the idea
                 that general computing’s storage requirement is only
                 about SIZE is (pardon the harsh word) ignorant. The main
                 reason that the Pi is awful as a Linux desktop machine is
                 because USB and SD is terribly slow and ill-suited for
                 small random writes.

                      I use a Pi3B+ with Ubuntu Mate as a Linux Desktop
                      and it performs quite well. Much better than
                      expected, but I use a fast SD card. There’s seems to
                      be a memory freeze with certain browsers, but that’s
                      it. ( Might be better with more RAM or it’s a Ubuntu
                      bug.)
                      If you want a complete PC replacement, your biggest
                      issue should be the ARM processor and the GPU.
                      There’s a lot of software not available on ARM, and
                      a lot of things the GPU can’t do. That said, it’s
                      also not the point of $35 hardware, I think.

            I’d recommend using a USB3 attached SSD. Although in my use of
            it with just an SD card, it’s been very good, as the
            controller now has double the speed of previous models.

                 doesn’t matter that it’s an ssd on the other end of that
                 usb3 connector. the problem isn’t about theoretical
                 throughput of usb3 or sd. problem is that these two are
                 not good for doing lots of tiny writing to because every
                 time you write to sd or usb mass storage there’s an
                 extended verification/finalizing procedure which takes in
                 relative terms a huge amount of time. sd and usb is only
                 good for reading fast from. fire up a web browser on any
                 pi with any storage and it will be painful because of how
                 often the browsers write little temp cache data here and
                 there, and usb3/sd is the reason this will bog down to a
                 crawl.

                      And yet, here I am using Chromium on a Pi4, multiple
                      tabs open, using an SD card for storage, and I
                      cannot really tell the difference between it and my
                      i7 laptop with SATA attached SSD. So it seem this
                      ‘small writes problem’ with USB or even SD card
                      storage isn’t really that much of a problem. Seems
                      like it’s one of these theoretical problems that
                      most people never encounter.

                      Also worth noting that Linux’s write behind caching
                      collates small writes, which might be why the actual
                      performance impact is negligible. In effect, the
                      caching means less small writes, more big ones.

                           Can you check if Chromium has Hardware

                           Additional I’d recommend changing the fs to
                           f2fs. It makes a world of difference to SD card
                           access speed.

            Use already have eMMC slot. Just use a converter like this
            https://wiki.radxa.com/Rockpi4/install/eMMC
            from eMMC storage to microSD.
            Protocol is the same. Just check the voltage of eMMC to be
            3.3V It has some peculiarities though, read
            https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1482610
            From what I know, eMMC can have some logical “partitions”.
            Maybe it’s necessary to partition them first.

       Finally 5 years later a raspberry-pi gets USB3 to compete with
       Odroid SBCs. Still the Odroid-N2 with 12nm and it’s awesome
       heatsink is cooler than the rpi4 with 28nm and no heatsink. Let’s
       see how the software evolves.

            in some places less good. And its software support is nowhere
            near as good as the Pi range. Would it be worth comparing

       Now that was a good start of the week! The internet buzzing with
       good news, you could almost feel the excitement in the air. I’ve
       been expecting this announcement for a long time.
       A question though and I quote:
       “One notable step forward is that for Raspberry Pi 4, we are
       retiring the legacy graphics driver stack used on previous models.
       Instead, we’re using the Mesa “V3D” driver developed by Eric Anholt
       at Broadcom over the last five years. This offers many benefits,
       including OpenGL-accelerated web browsing and desktop composition,
       and the ability to run 3D applications in a window under X.”
       Does this mean that we’ll be working in an always OpenGL mode (no
       longer experimental) and that apps like Blender or Glise will
       finally work flawlessly?
       It’s not like I won’t try myself when my board arrives, it would be
       nice to know though what that statement means beforehand.

       Awesome!
       Is there a reason to limit to 4Gb of ram, would it possible to have
       one with a empty ram slot so we can put 16 or 32 Gb chips?

                      Not sure there is a decent use case. It’s cheaper to
                      provide multiple versions than pay for a slot (very
                      expensive) on every board. There may also be
                      technical reasons – doing the PCB routing would be
                      horrendous and there probably isn’t space on the
                      board.

                           There is also a technical reason. The RAM is
                           limited to 4GB because of the 32 bit OS. 2^32 =
                           4GB. Like some developers said before,
                           supporting both 64 bit and 32 bit versions of
                           the OS is both expensive and impractical.
                           They’re definitely sticking to their guns on
                           the 32 bit OS.

                 So in a hypothetical future (where we can address more
                 than 4GB of RAM; either through PAE or 64-bit) RPiT could
                 release a model with 8GB of RAM? What’s the limit?

            I doubt there would be the room. We had to move to micro hdmi
            just for space reasons. Unless we didn’t provide dual output
            on any 4A.

                 Great job on the new design!
                 I think it would be potentially useful to think of a
                 potential 4A as ‘reduced accessory cost/increased
                 backward compatibility’ vs ‘reduced board cost’.
                 Including a full sized HDMI and maybe using the micro-B
                 power input would reduce the cost of new accessories for
                 people moving up from previous boards. Even if the board
                 cost was the same, I could see this being a popular
                 option.

                      This sounds mad. Why would you replace more modern
                      technology with old technology in the future? (I can
                      just about understand using full size HDMI – but USB
                      C is definitely an upgrade over microUSB. And in any
                      case, the cost of adapters for HDMI is tiny)
                      I just hope that the Pi Zero and “mainline” Pi end
                      up using the same size HDMI connector.

                      really happy to see the new Pi4 features, but
                      reluctant concerning just the micro hdmi… I see it
                      as a very small and fragile connector for usually
                      bulky hdmi cables… using just a solid adapter is
                      IMHO easily asking for breaking the connector on the
                      Pi :(

                      that this would be hard / impossible due to
                      mechanical issues – the amount of strain that would

                 Maybe if full-sized HDMI socket was stacked on top of
                 each other like the USB ports, then the RPi4 could
                 support 2 full-sized HDMI ports? and would probably be a
                 more compatible physical design to the older RPi3B+.
                 I for example got a touch screen and casing that fits
                 snugly over the RPi3B+ that uses the full-sized HDMI
                 port, and which a micro-HDMI dongle or cable is not
                 really an option as no space for it. So can’t use that
                 accessory with the RPi4.

       Do you think pi4 will be enough powerful to run a video
       surveillance software like Shinobi (look @ shinobi video), handling
       4-5 rtsp 2mpx streams ?
       I tested that software (free) over an old Amd Sempron laptop
       (ouch!) with obvious poor results.
       I was oriented to an odroid xu4 solution, especially for 8cores and
       video decoding features.. But now I read about the new pi..
       How is the new board compared to the odroid,in terms of cpu power
       and video handling features?

       The 4B specs listed above note that “USB is provided via an
       external VLI controller.”
       On the 3B+ power to the USB ports can be toggled through software
       control of the LAN9514 ethernet and USB hub chip.
       This is a really nice feature on the 3B+ as it obviates the need
       for a separate USB relay device or managed hub since one can use
       simple “/usr/sbin/uhubctl -l 1-1 -p 2 -a off” and
       “/usr/sbin/uhubctl -l 1-1 -p 2 -a on” commands to toggle power to
       the USB ports.
       Can the power to the USB ports be toggled in software on the 4B via
       the provided VLI controller?

       Great news!
       Ordered mine (4GB), will probably get it between 9th-13th (got an
       event on the 14th, so cutting close to show it off).
       Mmm… will there be added gpio alt functions? As the speed per pin
       is about 2.5x higher, it seems there could be more options under
       the hood.

            Why would we need dual ethernet? Its a minor use case easily
            achieved with a USB->ethernet dongle.

       Linus Torvalds once said if developers don’t write code on ARM
       machines, then ARM will never be ready to overtake x86. I started
       looking at ARM boards with enough power to support full desktop
       environment + IDE + browsers. I think the 4GB Pi4 is still a little
       bit short (I would have preferred 6GB, perhaps for $65?) but it is
       a big step forward. I look forward to the day where developers can
       happily develop on a complete PI kit costing <$100.

            drop, and that’ll make room for an 8GB model (perhaps 1GB for

       I wonder what’s the story behind the dual HDMI display. I heard
       plenty of people who would like a power switch, but never someone
       who wanted dual video output.
       Clearly, what I heard is not representative. :P But how did the Pi
       4 end up with two video outputs? Has another highly desired feature
       been considered but turned down because of… _reasons_?

            The Pi is very commonly used in digital signage displays, I’d
            expect that is where the 2 HDMI’s came from, and there were
            more voices asking for that than a power switch.
            Seems like a reasonable decision to me.

                 I completely forgot about digital signage, but then I
                 also don’t have numbers on how frequently it’s used in
                 such scenarios.
                 I wonder what’s the difference in cost between the second
                 HDMI output and a power switch circuit. If the VideoCore
                 VI can natively output to two displays, then I guess all
                 that was required was just the wiring and the connector
                 itself, making it considerably easier (and cheaper) than
                 adding more circuitry for the power switch.

            Many of the artists I work with who use RPi as embedded
            controllers for their installation displays have been crying
            out for dual displays…

            There are a couple of reasons I can think of.
            The obvious one is digital signage. Two outputs halves the
            number of ‘pis you need for a given installation, which is
            good (especially given how cheap the ‘pi is to start with!).
            But really, I suspect the reason is enterprise thin clients.
            “we have initially built more of the 2GB variant than of the
            others” seems odd; why would this make sense? I can understand
            why 1GB would be popular (it’s cheap, and if 1GB of RAM was
            enough on the Pi 3B+ then 1GB will be enough on the 4… unless
            you need more VRAM for the second screen!), and I can
            understand why 4GB would be popular (all the enthusiasts who
            go “POWERRRRR” a-la Jeremy Clarkson), but 2GB seems like the
            ugly sibling. Citrix have already released a pi-based product
            (https://channeldailynews.com/news/citrix-unveils-new-thin-cli
            ent-and-its-a-sub-100-pi/48199) – I’m sure they’d be
            interested in a more powerful, dual screen ready, product. If
            the SOC already supports multiple displays, then the marginal
            cost of an extra HDMI port is tiny.
            Disclaimer: I don’t work for RPiT / RPiF, and have no
            additional insight; this was just gleened from the internet.

                 @Ben: Indeed, increasing the amount of VRAM allows for
                 better performance for 3D applications that would suffer
                 within the confines of the 1GB version of the Pi. The
                 extra RAM might also come in handy if the two displays
                 would have to run different videos, which implies two
                 players requiring more RAM.
                 When 2GB are enough for RAM+VRAM, with some RAM to spare,
                 it makes more sense to save money by buying lots of 2GB
                 versions instead of the 4GB version. Because it’s just
                 the RAM difference, no extra features or performance.

       This looks awesome, and I cannot wait to see what you guys come up
       with for the compute module 4.
       What is the Rpi team thinking of for compatibility with the
       existing compute modules?
       Would it make sense to put the pcie on a ribbon connector on the
       compute module to allow expansion if needed, but keep pin
       compatibility with previous designs?
       (I may be biased towards this)
       But bias aside, it woule keep costs down, give expansion options,
       and the routing should be fairly possible without all the other
       accessories in the way…

       Hmmm. With 2 HDMI displays, one with touchscreen, then we can have
       digital keyboard! Clamshell Pi, similar to Nintendo 3DS, is
       possible!
       I personally have no use for dual screen, but that’s just me. I’d
       rather have cables that does not use adapters since I travel a lot.
       I still think that Raspberry pi zerow is the best learning computer
       and that vnc is a great way to access it, instead of an external
       monitor.
       My dream 3G computer is finally here, and I’m happy. 1Ghz CPU, 1 GB
       RAM, and 1 Gbit Bandwidth. Anything more is a bonus.
       There’s only a limited application for extra power. Raytracing with
       CPU. Video editing with Bandwidth. Database with RAM. Browsing? RPi
       3 seems to be handling it well enough.
       Oh, well. I’m aiming for that desktop kit bundle, and so I’ll be
       eating ramen for the next few weeks! I’m looking forward to it.
       PS: VNC server suddenly stops working. I suspect that the original
       key is expired and need refreshing. I guess I’ll be installing
       tightvncserver instead.

       What I would like to ask of our AMAZINGLY active developers is,
       will you guys make more in depth Linux and techy stuff? I really
       want to take things a step further with pi projects, but I’m
       faltering trying to find really in depth (AND UP TO DATE) resources
       for that. I want to read the nutty gritty of the technical
       decisions and hardware architecture. I want to learn how to set up
       elaborate use cases and simulated environments. I would really like
       some very challenging RPi learning materials. I know you guys are
       all for education, but I’d just like to ask for a step up in
       difficulty level on the reading material. I would love to hear
       every nerdy thing you have to say.
       Now, don’t get me wrong. I was the kid with an RPi following
       scratch tutorials when I was 12. I was on the original raspberry
       pi. I learned so much. I’m so excited for number four. My current
       boss told my father to buy that original raspberry pi for me. Years
       ago. I didn’t even know that he’s the one who recommended it to him
       when I applied for my job. Now I’m the youngest person (at 18) to
       ever work where I do. I get made fun of for my age, right up until
       I fix their problem. I have my dad, my boss, and the raspberry pi
       foundation to thank for some of my most monumental accomplishments.
       I hope for many future pi revisions to come.

       Please post a 3D model of the Pi 4 in addition to the current
       mechanical drawing. While the current drawing is great, it leaves
       out some critical dimensions needed by anyone creating a case for
       the Pi 4 (it’s also missing 2 critical views, so no elevations).
       A STEP file should be good enough for any CAD software to be able
       to use to design around, although some may prefer an IGES file.
       While the community eventually managed to produce these for the Pi
       3, it took a long time and they’re somewhat difficult to find.
       Congratulations on getting the second iteration of the silicon

            Even easier would be the I/O list with manufacturer of the

            place it. The DXF is a great start and and using the comps
            from the 3B+. But, the usb C, micro hdmi, and micro SD adapter
            (possibly the headset jack) have definitely changed. Hoping
            there will be more info on these soon. If they don’t, I’ll

       For a little while, the CommunityFM (to-air) radio station I was in
       charge of, ran its entire system with 3 raspberry Pi B2’s. They
       were running our own very-hybridised System D linux. There was a
       thin client in the studio which acted like a control module for the
       “real” computer ( another Pi ) at the transmission tower. We
       weren’t sending a microwave feed from studio to tower as most
       traditional setup, and we had a ‘listener’ pi doing things like
       sending telemetry to the tech’s residence, and re-booting or
       switching over in times of power loss. We ran another separate
       Raspberry Pi A as an off-air logger.
       .
       Needless to say our power costs were slashed to about 30% of
       original consumption, and then we had air-conditioning costs cut
       because we weren’t cooling excessive equipment in our transmission
       room. The place was a quiet a a ghost, and I wrote some software
       for iPad that allowed our presenters to broadcast from over IP. The
       only down-side was that we were always searching for a good studio
       quality microphone that didn’t consume a lot of power when doing
       outside interviews. Our studio microphone was, however, almost to
       good, we had to put our clock on the other side of the studio
       window.
       Other people took over and were afraid that we were using $50
       computers when we should have been using $$2000 +, but we were
       broadcast spec through our mondulators etc. Not once ever, even
       when we loaded it up with 10,000 processes, did it ever crash. Not
       once. Meanwhile their expensive PC’s were always needing attention.
       Such is the life of a community or public radio. Do something
       worthwhile, and they come out of the woodwork to stuff it up in any
       way they can. I’ve got the system at my place and can set it up
       again with the PI 4 and I am pleased the Ethernet bottleneck
       through USB has been fixed.

       My “dream” upgrades for the Raspberry Pi for some years have
       included Gigabit Ethernet, USB3 and SATA connectors. Well, 2 out of
       3 ain’t bad, and the inclusion of USB3 means that SATA is not so
       critical. It means that the Pi can now be a network file server
       with decent performance. The two big bottlenecks (network speed and
       filesystem speed) have been shattered, and the CPU looks to have
       the grunt to handle the improved I/O speed.
       Well done to all the team from down under.

       Is it possible to use 1 of the HDMI ports for an input device?
       E.g: capturing video feed on HDMI1, displaying the content on
       HDMI2?

       It may be a trivial point but I like the fact that the RAM is now
       on the top side of the board! It makes it easy to point out all the
       different “parts of a computer” to students. Oh, and there’s a
       separate ROM chip now, too!

       I read the comment about how decoding HDR won’t be immediately
       available, but if I simply want to use this as a NAS with a
       external HDD connected to it and then HDMI to TV can I let the TV
       do the decoding instead?
       What I am looking for is a solution where I can connect a storage
       unit (HDD or whatever) to my TV whilst having access to it via my
       network. Ideally I connect the HDD via USB as the TV is happy to
       play video from the HDD in USB mode. However when I connected my
       HDD to my router and made it a network drive, the TV, for some
       reason, didn’t want to play along. Now I connected the HDD to my
       laptop and set up Plex but for some reason the 4k stuff
       buffers/lags. I have more than adequate network (500/500Mbit line
       and a good router). I read something about setting up specific
       ports but haven’t tried that.
       Now best solution would be RPi4 having the HDD connected to it for
       storage, then connecting the RPi4 via HDMI. Question is, can it
       simply pass through the 4k+HDR content and let the TV do the work?
       Technically you could say what I need is a device that connects my
       storage to my TV and network at the same time. I’m hoping this to
       be it (ofc with it being a RPi4 I’d use it to more than just the
       content so that’s a plus!).

            Not sure what your question was as cannot find it, but there
            is improved circuit protection on the GPIO power pins so
            shorting the PMIC will not cause the same level of damage.
            Probably not the question you asked though. Not idea why it
            didn’t appear, since this one has.

            Yes, the GPIO pins are fundamentally the same – HATs designed

                      connector remains in the same location, so Raspberry

       I’m really interested in the reason why the Raspberry still has no
       UFL external Antenna connector, as I think that this would not be a
       price question (a UFL connector is a cheap component)
       We’re using the Raspberry in industrial environments where they are
       often housed in metal casings and the like making an external
       antenna absolutely necessary.

                      Separate antenna == more cost. Lots more cost.
                      Currently the antenna is part of the PCB, so
                      effectively zero cost.

       I love all the upgrades, but would have liked it a bit different.
       Still, I will be buying many – very many :)
       Since you moved the Ethernet port, making it incompatible with
       older cases, I would have liked it if you went ahead and moved
       other things around as well.
       Drop the USB 2.0 ports (3.0 is backward compatible anyway), and
       replace with 2 (or more ) USB C ports – one for power and the
       others for devices. Then power is on the same side as the most used
       connectors and makes case design and fitting of the Pi into various
       locations easier, IMO, as the most common connections come out of
       the one side only, instead of USB & Ethernet on one side and Power
       on another.
       Then you’d have enough room (maybe?) on the side for 2 full sized
       HDMI ports instead of the 2 fragile mini-ports.
       Of course, there is the price point of $35, which may make all this
       impossible.

       Dear Raspberry Pi folks,
       I’m thrilled that you finally overcame the cramped IO bottlenecks
       for USB and GbE, which was my largest annoyance with the past
       RPi’s. There’s so many new, great things with the Rpi 4, and it’s
       awesome that it’s still $35, and still the same credit-card-sized
       form factor.
       Great work, everyone, and thanks for your very hard work to do so
       much down at the hardware and software levels to facilitate this.
       Moving to the 28nm process no doubt required all sorts of major
       redesigns. And releasing Raspbian Buster now, is a very progressive
       move on your part. I’m typing this now in Raspbian buster myself!
       May you all live long and prosper! You deserve it!
       PS: Thanks for making the new plastic cases and power supplies much
       cheaper, as the accessories were a little too overpriced-feeling
       before this (if you wanted good quality ones). So you’ve addressed
       my second-biggest gripe here too, feeling nickeled-and-dimed, once
       the cost of accessories was factored into the total price.
       I also love the new default desktop background of Raspbian Buster.

       I was surprised by the early release of the 4B but a good present

       The most important to me was backward compatibility, great to see
       RPT have used VideoCore 4/5/6, I was only aware of one Broadcom SoC
       using VC5 and kudos to Broadcom for allowing the VC family to be
       further developed.
       Availability to 2026 is a bold move but does show a commitment to

            as a misprint that will be ‘fixed’, that doesn’t explicitly
            mean that the information printed is negated. It can simply
            mean that that particular feline was not scheduled for release
            from the bag yet.

                 No, I’m afraid the information on the leaflet is simply
                 incorrect. The BCM2711 processor is in theory capable of
                 addressing 16GB of SDRAM, but at present there is no
                 available memory package larger than 4GB that works
                 correctly with its SDRAM controller and PHY.

       The USB 3.0 controller is VIA VL806, it sucks.
       The chipset usually disconnect while transfer large file.
       So that it may not be stable to work a RAID-1 on Pi 4.
       Asmedia is better than VIA.

            In pictures it appeats to be the VL805-Q6 (the 4 port variant
            of the VL806).
            Maybe it is a later revision? In the past I used a NEC
            controller that also had disconnect problems that seem to be
            resolved in later revisions of that chip.
            I also tried a VL805 at that time, but discarded it as it
            didn’t work with IOMMU enabled on my mainboard. But that isn’t
            a problem for the Pi4.
            There aren’t that many options: VIA, ASMedia, Fresco Logic or
            Renesas/NEC (and the much smaller Etron).
            The VIA VL805 is also firmware upgradable, there have been a
            number of different firmware versions, maybe they fixed the
            problems? They probably did test it rather extensively :)

       Awesome, thank you for your great job.
       Since you offer the Pi4 in a “Pi 4 Deskop Kit”, too:
       Do you plan to upgrade the official Pi keyboard to have USB-3
       connector AND hub built-in?
       When using the Pi as a desktop computer, that would give the
       benefit of being able to hide the Pi4 and have only the mouse and
       keyboard on the desk, while still have a USB3 jack accessible for
       e.g. fast memory sticks.

       Seems to me an “A” version would be quite feasible, and useful, if
       it replaces the ethernet port with one of the USB3 ports such that
       there are 3 USB ports across, instead of double height, to make an
       overall lower profile.
       For the (minority?) use cases needing ethernet, a USB adapter would
       do the job, still leaving 2 USB ports (and wifi).
       Re the form factor, could previous cases for Pi2/3 be used if the
       area where the power and HDMI jacks are located were to be “reamed”
       out to make one long opening for the USB-C and micro HDMI
       connectors? Will all other connector openings match?

       This has affected most of my time synced works…especially from a

       And this device shouldn’t need any extra battery thing….just a
       simple small internal battery to keep the clock. Thats all.

            You cannot just add a battery. We’d need to add another chip
            to provide a real-time clock, and a battery to power it. Given
            that in the vast majority of usage cases, the Pi just syncs to
            a network time server as soon as it boots, that would be
            wasted hardware (and wasted board space, wasted cost in the
            bill of materials etc) for most use cases.
            If you really need a secure clock, there are numerous
            third-party HAT accessories which will provide one, such as
            https://www.robotshop.com/uk/rtc-hat-raspberry-pi.html (That’s
            just the first one Google found – no idea how well it works!)

       Hi, really respect what’s been accomplished with the Pi-4.
       When swapping from a single HDMI port, was replacing it with two
       USB-C ports, rather than Micro-HDMI considered, or would this not
       have been possible (due to say a more expensive controller,
       slightly high port costs, or added complexity/conflict with regard
       to powering the device)?

            I really wish they would have stuck with the single standard
            HDMI port. Doing this made the new PI instantly incompatible
            with every Case on the market, and seriously who is going to
            use 4k dual monitors on a weak Raspberry PI?
            With the USB-C issue, the mini-HDMI connectors, and the lack
            of USB boot… I’m glad I didn’t buy this new RPI on impulse
            like I normally do.
            Does anybody really have mini-HDMI connectors laying around? I
            had never seen nor used a mini-HDMI connector before this.
            They also aren’t readily available in my local stores. Which
            is another extra expense along with a new case.
            I think I’ll sit this one out for now and see what happens. My
            other Raspberries are still serving me well anyway.

       The Gigabit interface and separate USB3 bus work well together,
       especially in a NAS application. I can transfer files to the pi at
       65 over megabytes/sec. And for reading (moving a large file from
       the Pi, over the network), I get average speeds well over 100 MB/s.
       It even saturates the Gigabit lan. Astonishing. For more see
       http://unixetc.co.uk/2019/07/07/raspberry-pi-4-real-world-tests/
       The Pi 4 makes apps like Nextcloud enjoyably fast. I have written a
       basic installation procedure here:
       http://unixetc.co.uk/2016/11/20/simple-nextcloud-installation-on-ra

       and an automatic install (with Ansible) here. Not only does the
       software run faster on the Pi 4, it also installs much faster:

       as a teacher, I wouldn’t mind having at least 24 of them at 4gig
       yet, even on E-bat; $1,190.00 for 11 of them is completely silly.
       When the price starts to match what you are asking, then I’ll think
       avout it. And, besides, the model 3B+ at [email protected] each and
       free shipping we Can Afford – I’ve ordered 50 of them and they have
       arrived.
       will the 4B ever have built-in eMMC 64gig or are you allowing what
       has happened to the Arduino Line to take over the 4B designs and do
       it the right way by xmas 2019??

       – Do you plan (and if: when) to release a new PCB version with the
       secondary USB-C resistor included?

More power to your Pi

     * James Adams

   It’s been just over three weeks since we launched the new Raspberry Pi
   3 Model B+. Although the product is branded Raspberry Pi 3B+ and not
   Raspberry Pi 4, a serious amount of engineering was involved in
   creating it. The wireless networking, USB/Ethernet hub, on-board power
   supplies, and BCM2837 chip were all upgraded: together these represent
   almost all the circuitry on the board! Today, I’d like to tell you
   about the work that has gone into creating a custom power supply chip
   for our newest computer.

Successful launch

   The Raspberry Pi 3B+ has been well received, and we’ve enjoyed hearing
   feedback from the community as well as reading the various reviews and
   articles highlighting the solid improvements in wireless networking,
   Ethernet, CPU, and thermal performance of the new board. Gareth
   Halfacree’s post here has some particularly nice graphs showing the
   increased performance as well as how the Pi 3B+ keeps cool under load
   due to the new CPU package that incorporates a metal heat spreader. The
   Raspberry Pi production lines at the Sony UK Technology Centre are
   running at full speed, and it seems most people who want to get hold of
   the new board are able to find one in stock.

Powering your Pi

   One of the most critical but often under-appreciated elements of any
   electronic product, particularly one such as Raspberry Pi with lots of
   complex on-board silicon (processor, networking, high-speed memory), is
   the power supply. In fact, the Raspberry Pi 3B+ has no fewer than six
   different voltage rails: two at 3.3V — one special ‘quiet’ one for
   audio, and one for everything else; 1.8V; 1.2V for the LPDDR2 memory;
   and 1.2V nominal for the CPU core. Note that the CPU voltage is
   actually raised and lowered on the fly as the speed of the CPU is
   increased and decreased depending on how hard the it is working. The
   sixth rail is 5V, which is the master supply that all the others are
   created from, and the output voltage for the four downstream USB ports;
   this is what the mains power adaptor is supplying through the micro USB
   power connector.

Power supply primer

   There are two common classes of power supply circuits: linear
   regulators and switching regulators. Linear regulators work by creating
   a lower, regulated voltage from a higher one. In simple terms, they
   monitor the output voltage against an internally generated reference
   and continually change their own resistance to keep the output voltage
   constant. Switching regulators work in a different way: they ‘pump’
   energy by first storing the energy coming from the source supply in a
   reactive component (usually an inductor, sometimes a capacitor) and
   then releasing it to the regulated output supply. The switches in
   switching regulators effect this energy transfer by first connecting
   the inductor (or capacitor) to store the source energy, and then
   switching the circuit so the energy is released to its destination.

   Linear regulators produce smoother, less noisy output voltages, but
   they can only convert to a lower voltage, and have to dissipate energy
   to do so. The higher the output current and the voltage difference
   across them is, the more energy is lost as heat. On the other hand,
   switching supplies can, depending on their design, convert any voltage
   to any other voltage and can be much more efficient (efficiencies of
   90% and above are not uncommon). However, they are more complex and
   generate noisier output voltages.

   Designers use both types of regulators depending on the needs of the
   downstream circuit: for low-voltage drops, low current, or low noise,
   linear regulators are usually the right choice, while switching
   regulators are used for higher power or when efficiency of conversion
   is required. One of the simplest switch-mode power supply circuits is
   the buck converter, used to create a lower voltage from a higher one,
   and this is what we use on the Pi.

A history lesson

   The BCM2835 processor chip (found on the original Raspberry Pi Model B
   and B+, as well as on the Zero products) has on-chip power supplies:
   one switch-mode regulator for the core voltage, as well as a linear one
   for the LPDDR2 memory supply. This meant that in addition to 5V, we
   only had to provide 3.3V and 1.8V on the board, which was relatively
   simple to do using cheap, off-the-shelf parts.

   The Pi Zero sports a BCM2835 processor, which only needs two external
   switchers (the components clustered behind the camera port)

   When we moved to the BCM2836 for Raspberry Pi Model 2 (and subsequently
   to the BCM2837A1 and B0 for Raspberry Pi 3B and 3B+), the core supply
   and the on-chip LPDDR2 memory supply were not up to the job of
   supplying the extra processor cores and larger memory, so we removed
   them. (We also used the recovered chip area to help fit in the new
   quad-core ARM processors.) The upshot of this was that we had to supply
   these power rails externally for the Raspberry Pi 2 and models
   thereafter. Moreover, we also had to provide circuitry to sequence them
   correctly in order to control exactly when they power up compared to
   the other supplies on the board.

Power supply design is tricky (but critical)

   Raspberry Pi boards take in 5V from the micro USB socket and have to
   generate the other required supplies from this. When 5V is first
   connected, each of these other supplies must ‘start up’, meaning go
   from ‘off’, or 0V, to their correct voltage in some short period of
   time. The order of the supplies starting up is often important:
   commonly, there are structures inside a chip that form diodes between
   supply rails, and bringing supplies up in the wrong order can sometimes
   ‘turn on’ these diodes, causing them to conduct, with undesirable
   consequences. Silicon chips come with a data sheet specifying what
   supplies (voltages and currents) are needed and whether they need to be
   low-noise, in what order they must power up (and in some cases down),
   and sometimes even the rate at which the voltages must power up and
   down.

   A Pi 2. Power supply components are clustered in the bottom left-hand
   corner next to the micro USB port, middle (above the LPDDR2 chip, which
   is on the bottom of the PCB) and above the A/V jack.

   In designing the power chain for the Pi 2 and 3, the sequencing was
   fairly straightforward: power rails power up in order of voltage (5V,
   3.3V, 1.8V, 1.2V). However, the supplies were all generated with
   individual, discrete devices. Therefore, I spent quite a lot of time
   designing circuitry to control the sequencing — even with some design
   tricks to reduce component count, quite a few sequencing components are
   required. More complex systems generally use a Power Management
   Integrated Circuit (PMIC) with multiple supplies on a single chip, and
   many different PMIC variants are made by various manufacturers. Since
   Raspberry Pi 2 days, I was looking for a suitable PMIC to simplify the
   Pi design, but invariably (and somewhat counter-intuitively) these were
   always too expensive compared to my discrete solution, usually because
   they came with more features than needed.

One device to rule them all

   It was way back in May 2015 when I first chatted to Peter Coyle of Exar
   (Exar were bought by MaxLinear in 2017) about power supply products for
   Raspberry Pi. We didn’t find a product match then, but in June 2016
   Peter, along with Tuomas Hollman and Trevor Latham, visited to pitch
   the possibility of building a custom power management solution for us.

   I was initially sceptical that it could be made cheap enough. However,
   our discussion indicated that if we could tailor the solution to just
   what we needed, it could be cost-effective. Over the coming weeks and
   months, we honed a specification we agreed on from the initial sketches
   we’d made, and Exar thought they could build it for us at the target
   price.

   The chip we designed would contain all the key supplies required for
   the Pi on one small device in a cheap QFN package, and it would also
   perform the required sequencing and voltage monitoring. Moreover, the
   chip would be flexible to allow adjustment of supply voltages from
   their default values via I2C; the largest supply would be capable of
   being adjusted quickly to perform the dynamic core voltage changes
   needed in order to reduce voltage to the processor when it is idling
   (to save power), and to boost voltage to the processor when running at
   maximum speed (1.4 GHz). The supplies on the chip would all be
   generously specified and could deliver significantly more power than
   those used on the Raspberry Pi 3. All in all, the chip would contain
   four switch-mode converters and one low-current linear regulator, this
   last one being low-noise for the audio circuitry.

The MXL7704 chip

   The project was a great success: MaxLinear delivered working samples of
   first silicon at the end of May 2017 (almost exactly a year after we
   had kicked off the project), and followed through with production
   quantities in December 2017 in time for the Raspberry Pi 3B+ production
   ramp.

   (group of six men, two of whom are holding Raspberry Pi boards)

   Front row: Roger with the very first Pi 3B+ prototypes and James with a
   MXL7704 development board hacked to power a Pi 3. Back row left to
   right: Will Torgerson, Trevor Latham, Peter Coyle, Tuomas Hollman.

   The MXL7704 device has been key to reducing Pi board complexity and
   therefore overall bill of materials cost. Furthermore, by being able to
   deliver more power when needed, it has also been essential to
   increasing the speed of the (newly packaged) BCM2837B0 processor on the
   3B+ to 1.4GHz. The result is improvements to both the continuous output
   current to the CPU (from 3A to 4A) and to the transient performance
   (i.e. the chip has helped to reduce the ‘transient response’, which is
   the change in supply voltage due to a sudden current spike that occurs
   when the processor suddenly demands a large current in a few
   nanoseconds, as modern CPUs tend to do).

   With the MXL7704, the power supply circuitry on the 3B+ is now a lot
   simpler than the Pi 3B design. This new supply also provides the LPDDR2
   memory voltage directly from a switching regulator rather than using
   linear regulators like the Pi 3, thereby improving energy efficiency.
   This helps to somewhat offset the extra power that the faster Ethernet,
   wireless networking, and processor consume. A pleasing side effect of
   using the new chip is the symmetric board layout of the regulators —
   it’s easy to see the four switch-mode supplies, given away by four
   similar-looking blobs (three grey and one brownish), which are the
   inductors.

Kudos

   It takes a lot of effort to design a new chip from scratch and get it
   all the way through to production — we are very grateful to the team at
   MaxLinear for their hard work, dedication, and enthusiasm. We’re also
   proud to have created something that will not only power Raspberry Pis,
   but will also be useful for other product designs: it turns out when
   you have a low-cost and flexible device, it can be used for many things
   — something we’re fairly familiar with here at Raspberry Pi! For the
   curious, the product page (including the data sheet) for the MXL7704
   chip is here. Particular thanks go to Peter Coyle, Tuomas Hollman, and
   Trevor Latham, and also to Jon Cronk, who has been our contact in the
   US and has had to get up early to attend all our conference calls!

   The MXL7704 design team celebrating on Pi Day — it takes a lot of
   people to design a chip!

   I hope you liked reading about some of the effort that has gone into
   creating the new Pi. It’s nice to finally have a chance to tell people
   about some of the (increasingly complex) technical work that makes
   building a $35 computer possible — we’re very pleased with the
   Raspberry Pi 3B+, and we hope you enjoy using it as much as we’ve
   enjoyed creating it!

       Interesting article, thanks for sharing it. Thanks also to the
       Raspberry Pi Foundation for building an environment that brings
       these industrial strength tools to a large population.
       Would the new supply solution allow us to use traditional (and
       traditionally a bit inadequate) USB supplies to power the model
       3B+? That would simplify life for those who do not have the option
       of using the 5.1 / 5.25 Volt supplies we’ve been accustomed to
       using when we run our RPis in higher performance applications.

            Hi Len I’m afraid you’ll still need a good quality 2.5A power
            supply for the 3B+ – although this new solution is a bit more
            efficient the total power requirement has still gone up
            overall (due to the faster processor, Gigabit Ethernet and
            dual band wireless).

       Will this be able to be “back ported” to the Pi2 and Pi3 platforms,
       since there is not a current plan to end those lines? Maybe reduce

                 Andrew is right, plus the legacy boards are usually
                 bought by customers who have qualified the Pi as part of
                 a system and changing the Pi design in this way would
                 (for some) require expensive re-qualification. It is
                 something we have considered, though.

       It’s been a roller coaster ride for me, some power

            The USB 5V (VBUS) output is limited to 1.2A, but this should
            power a good majority of drives (as long as your upstream

            work.

       way to access the I2C to the chip?
       I also made a forum post, as this is going to be a longer
       discussion. I hope ;-)

       On of the things which need a great attention is by my experience
       the usb cable (of course if you use a power supply without a fixed
       cable).
       In the past I runned i a few of a apparent seeming issues of under
       voltage which belongs to a wrong usb cable. That’s the rerason that
       I have a lot of cables at home which I weeded out for not usable on
       the Rasberry Pi.
       In some cases it could be a good idea to give an exchange of the
       cable a try. I have no finally clue or suggestion but it seems to
       be that a pure charge cable will be a better expirience than a
       regular usb cable.

       Are you still “setting” the price at $35 for the new Pi? I was
       fortunate to acquire one through Amazon at that price … but the
       same merchant is now offering them for about US$10 MORE than
       before. I know you cannot control dealers – but is RaspberryPi.org
       still ASKING that dealers respect a certain price point?

       I have a reservation about the power over ethernet board. It has a
       fan which adds noise and reduces the reliability due to the
       lifetime of the fan.

       Hi James
       Is it possible to remove the xml7704, and power the pi from
       externals ultra lownoise regulators.
       I have removed the power chip on the”old” 3b, and have a remarkable
       improvement in the sound quality. I use the pi for high end audio,
       with software from moode audio.
       All best

       I think that this MXL7704 PMIC for RPI3 B+ is different from normal
       MXL7704(-AQB or -XQB) IC.
       these normal part have a default 1.35V voltage level instead of
       1.2V for LPDDR4.
       (this level can be changed by CPI by I2C protocol.)
       But I’m not sure this PMIC is normal part. (or custom part?)
       Would you let me know the original PMIC is MXL7704-AQB?

       that they are made for people that already know some thing about
       it. Is there a set of commands for the GPIO??) I realize that this
       may not the best place to ask these questions but if you can help
       me or send me to the right place I would deeply appreciate it. I am
       71 years old and it takes a while for things to soak in.

   Today we are excited to launch a new add-on board for your Raspberry
   Pi: the Raspberry Pi TV HAT, on sale now at $21.50.

   The TV HAT connects to the 40-pin GPIO header and to a suitable
   antenna, allowing your Raspberry Pi to receive DVB-T2 television
   broadcasts.

Watch TV with your Raspberry Pi

   With the board, you can receive and view television on a Raspberry Pi,
   or you can use your Pi as a server to stream television over a network
   to other devices. The TV HAT works with all 40-pin GPIO Raspberry Pi
   boards when running as a server. If you want to watch TV on the Pi
   itself, we recommend using a Pi 2, 3, or 3B+, as you may need more
   processing power for this.

Stream television over your network

   Viewing television is not restricted to Raspberry Pi computers: with a
   TV HAT connected to your network, you can view streams on any
   network-connected device. That includes other computers, mobile phones,
   and tablets. You can find instructions for setting up your TV HAT in
   our step-by-step guide.

New HAT form factor

   The Raspberry Pi TV HAT follows a new form factor of HAT (Hardware
   Attached on Top), which we are also announcing today. The TV HAT is a
   half-size HAT that matches the outline of Raspberry Pi Zero boards. A
   new HAT spec is available now. No features have changed electrically –
   this is a purely mechanical change.

   the new HAT form factor. Click to embiggen.

   The TV HAT has three bolt holes; we omitted the fourth so that the HAT
   can be placed on a large-size Pi without obstructing the display
   connector.

   The board comes with a set of mechanical spacers, a 40-way header, and
   an aerial adaptor.

Licences

   Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) is a widely adopted standard for
   transmitting broadcast television; see countries that have adopted the
   DVB standard here.

   Initially, we will be offering the TV HAT in Europe only. Compliance
   work is already underway to open other DVB-T2 regions. If you purchase
   a TV HAT, you must have the appropriate licence or approval to receive
   broadcast television. You can find a list of licences for Europe here.
   If in doubt, please contact your local licensing body.

   The Raspberry Pi TV HAT opens up some fantastic opportunities for
   people looking to embed a TV receiver into their networks. Head over to
   the TV HAT product page to find out where to get hold of yours. We
   can’t wait to see what you use it for!

       Fab little hat there, will be great paired with Plex DVR.
       Has the Pi Zero been tested to make sure it’s powerful enough to
       run it plus wifi, as obviously it struggles to do things like
       camera + wifi at times so would presume its going to be a similar
       situation here?

                 How was the frame rate? I’m getting very jittery
                 performance. I’d expect the bitrate to be just a few
                 megabits. Yet viewing via my browser on my MacBookPro
                 seems unreliable.

                      I downloaded a new desktop Raspbian image, flash it
                      onto a card. Plugged it into a brand new 3B+ with
                      this new hat plugged in, did an update and installed
                      TVHeadend, set it up from a browser on another PC
                      and I’m getting jittery freezes, some channels not
                      playing, and the EPG not populating with information
                      sometimes.
                      When I’ve got time I’ll have a look at settings and
                      config to see if I can tweak it to improve.

                           Update:
                           I had happened to test it on that night when
                           Freeview was affected by the weather (Sat
                           20th).
                           I’ve also discovered that the browser pop-out
                           video viewer in the TVHeaderend isn’t so great
                           and since I replaced it with Kodi as the
                           streaming client, it has been perfect, smooth
                           and reliable video.

       Good news! I have a question: how it’s handles HEVC codec (h265)?
       I’m asking because here in the Czech Republic we have DVB-T2 based
       on h265 and I know that RPi has no hardware acceleration for it.
       So, if this board is RF hardware only, than decoding will be CPU
       based and slllllloooow, right?

            If you want to watch it directly on your Pi you need a
            powerful one.
            “If you want to watch TV on the Pi itself, we recommend using
            a Pi 2, 3, or 3B+, as you may need more processing power for
            this.”
            The use case for this HAT is that you want to stream the raw
            DVB-T2 signal through WiFi and/or Ethernet and leave the
            decoding to a client with the proper hardware.

                 I currently only have ancient RPis. Is anyone selling new

            We can decode 1080p30 H265 in software (we’ve spent a lot of
            time accelerating this), the only question is whether
            tvheadend suitably provides the right formatting information
            for H265.
            Since we’ve been unable to test this in the UK (and we’ve not
            had feedback from our beta testers to the contrary), I can’t
            confirm it’ll work, but I’ve no reason to think it wouldn’t.
            Thanks

                 Is that h265-1080p30 a 3B+ or also on a Zero?
                 If zero that would be very impressive!
                 I assume it’s on a 3B+ but just asking because this HAT
                 is shaped like a zero.

            It depends on the format. I believe 1080p50, 720p50 and 540p50
            are legal formats for HEVC TV broadcasts in Europe.
            The latter two are fine. The first is beyond what we claim to
            support, but we have had reports of being able to play
            broadcast German 1080p50 HEVC from a TV-HAT with some
            overclocking.

                 We first need to find CXD2880 datasheet for inspecting
                 registers and see we we could find a trick to output I/Q.

            I’ve had one of these TV-HATs for a few weeks (the RPF folks
            sent me a couple for early support testing).
            The problem with getting it to run as a SDR is that you
            probably need to be able to poke some values in the Sony
            CXD2880 tuner’s registers.
            Now, if I could find a datasheet for the CXD2880 I might be
            able to find some values to try driving it as an SDR.
            I’m interested in ADS-B. I’ve got a RTL-SDR USB dongle that’s
            sitting on a Raspberry running very hot running a PiAware
            server.

            The TV HAT doesn’t decode the video, it just provides the
            video stream and allows you to access that stream through a
            software interface (tvheadend).
            You can then view the stream using a Pi with a 7″ display the
            same as you would play any video on a Raspberry Pi.

            It requires a different chipset and cable/satellite have the

                 Do note that in continental Europe most DVB-T(2) channels
                 are encrypted as well.
                 E.g. only the 3 public funded channels are unencrypted
                 here in the Netherlands.
                 If you want to watch the other 30, you need a
                 subscription/CAM/smartcard.

                      Actually creating a dual-tuner OR putting another
                      40-pin connector on the hat to allow two tuners be
                      stacked one on top another would be very easy since
                      the Raspberry-PI has TWO SPI interfaces on the hat!

                 DVB-T2. In Germany all private channels are encrypted on
                 DVB-T2 while the SD-versions are not encrypted via
                 DVB-S(2).

                 Shame as there is plenty of single tuners on the market
                 and in London you can get 9 multiplexes:
                 PSB1 BBCA – DTG-3
                 PSB2 D3+4 – DTG-3
                 PSB3 BBCB – DTG-6
                 COM4 SDN – DTG-8
                 COM5 ArqA – DTG-8
                 COM6 ArqB – DTG-8
                 LW – DTG-12
                 com7 – DTG-6
                 com8 – DTG-6
                 DTG-3 64QAM 8K 2/3 24.1Mb/s DVB-T MPEG2
                 DTG-6 256QAM 32KE 2/3 40.2Mb/s DVB-T2 MPEG4
                 DTG-8 64QAM 8K 3/4 27.1Mb/s DVB-T MPEG2
                 DTG-12 QSPK 8K 3/4 8.0Mb/s DVB-T MPEG2
                 How cool it would be to have a “one” pi TV hat to cover

                 To speed an ATSC tuner to market, you can talk with the
                 team at Hauppauge to try to incorporate their
                 WinTV-DualHD usb tuner into a HAT compatible device.
                 For designing your own, you can use the MaxLinear MXL
                 line as they incorporate demod and tuner into one
                 chipset. They are here in California, so let me know if
                 you need a contact.
                 Market for affordable/easy to use ATSC options is opening

                      The Fair Use law is for the United States only and
                      so would not apply to the rest of the world. Also,
                      it would not apply to streaming TV to your friends
                      over the internet. Fair Use is meant for short clips
                      of videos, movies, etc, not the entire thing.
                      However, if you are streaming over the air
                      broadcasts to a few friends, you’d likely not get
                      fined for that, depending upon the circumstances.
                      But, if you are streaming an American Football or
                      Basketball game to a friend that can’t get it
                      because they are in a blackout area, you’ll
                      certainly be fined if caught.
                      The rule of thumb for America is that if you can
                      receive the signals yourself, you’re allowed to
                      watch it. If you can’t, then you’re not.

            Space shifting (also known as place shifting) television

            depending on the usage scenario and your country of residence.

            Place shifting is legal for many European residents for

       be great to have a sentence or two in the product description to

            UK Freeview SD (MPEG2) and Freeview HD (H264) broadcast on
            DVB-T and DVB-T2 work pretty effectively on all flavours of
            Raspberry Pi (from the Zero to the 3B+) in my experience using
            USB or networked tuners, and all flavours of Pi handle the
            MPEG2 and H264 576i and 1080i broadcasts in the UK fine (even
            with 2x deinterlace) The MPEG2 licence was needed at one point
            for all Pis, and may still be for the single core models.
            The WiFI on the Zero W may be a bit marginal for streaming
            DVB-T2 H264 1080i stuff to other backends.
            The UK has no encrypted DVB-T/T2 broadcasts, so decryption
            isn’t an issue here in the UK – but it will be for those in
            other European countries where often only the Public Service
            Broadcasters are Free-to-Air, with many commercial services
            pay-TV and encrypted. The discussion of ways of decoding these
            services outside of using official receivers is always very
            tricky – irrespective of whether you have a valid subscription
            card.
            Out of interest – what interface is used to carry the MPEG2
            transport stream (that is carrying MPEG2 or H264 video and MP2
            or AAC audio) over the GPIO ports – is it a serial or a
            parallel transport stream interface?

                           possible. The deafult 40 way header only uses
                           one SPI interface, you would need to use a
                           second SPI interface for two TV Hats.

                 I can confirm that a PI 3B+ is certainly capable of
                 recording two HD channels from an external USB DVB-T2
                 decoder (PCTV 292e) and a couple of SD channels from a
                 DVB-T decoder (Hauppauge WinTV Nova T Stick). That’s
                 recording to the Pi’s own SD card, using TVHeadend. Oh,
                 and with its other hand it logs data from my weather
                 station using CumulusMX.
                 So in terms of data handling rate, it’s possible. Whether
                 this HAT can handle recording more than one HD channel
                 with suitable software (such as TVHeadend) is another
                 matter, but I can’t see that it would be a problem.
                 Until I buy a powered USB hub, I’m not risking recording
                 to an external HDD (spinning as opposed to SSD) because
                 I’ve had a few glitches in the past where the disk
                 dismounts itself and then comes back as a different
                 device (eg /dev/sdb1 instead of /dev/sda1), so I have to
                 make sure I copy recordings off the SD card via a SAMBA
                 share to my Windows PC.

            Yes, that’s the US dollar price. The electronic components
            used in our products are bought and sold in dollars, so we
            always quote prices in the same currency; it means we can give
            a stable price that doesn’t fluctuate with exchange rates.
            As Roger mentions (near the bottom, so you’re forgiven for not
            scrolling down that far!), at the moment TV HAT is only
            available in Europe, but compliance work to offer it in other
            DVB-T2 regions is already happening.
            We did realise that giving a dollar price might seem odd to
            some readers, given that the HAT isn’t currently available in
            the US. But because there simply is no specific price to quote
            in (for example) Euros, there isn’t really any other option
            unless we were to give a wordy explanation instead of just a
            price. Pi fans outside the US are long used to translating
            from the dollar prices of products.

            I guess the fact that the Sony manufacturing plant in Wales is
            used to make Pi’s might have influenced the chipset choice.
            Secondly a chipset with SPI is needed, the RTL2832 uses USB
            this isn’t available on the GPIO header

            DAB uses OFDM modulation as well as DVB-T(2). Here one
            multiplex od DAB+ uses 1.536Mhz of spectrum in III band.
            Bitrate 1.8Mb/s
            The chipset has support for 1.7MHz channel width, albeit with
            DVB-T2. Thus it may be possible that it can lock on the DAB
            signal and send the data. This feature may be hidden but
            there, has anyone looked?
            It may be more beneficial to make a compact radio receiver
            with crystal clear sound using Zero W than to make TV.
            Car radio comes to my mind…able to decode metadata embedded in
            the stream…

                 I think so. In germany cable companies do not encrypt

                 I know. Commercial TV programs may be encrypted or only

                 Many DVB-T/T2-sticks or cards are able to receive DVB-C

       One word of warning (I speak from bitter experience!). I notice
       that the Pi TV HAT uses a miniature socket and an adaptor to take a
       standard aerial cable. I have found that the miniature plug on the
       adaptor tends to pull out of the socket on my PCTV 292e USB adaptor
       – I have fastened it in securely with sellotape.
       Hopefully the socket on the Pi TV HAT is better engineered for a
       tight fit and doesn’t pull out if the aerial cable strains it. But
       have some sellotape ready just in case!

            This board will work with any Pi that has a 40 Way GPIO
            header. Older models may struggle to stream and view TV on the
            same Pi, running as a backend should be possible on any
            version of Pi.

       I can see this says it can receive DVB-T2 but I’m not clear on
       whether that means it can also receive DVB-T (what Australia is
       using currently). This would solve a terribly-placed antenna point
       problem in my apartment if it can receive DVB-T!

            Yes, I believe you can receive DVB-T, DVB-T2 is an extension
            of the standard.

            Yes – DVB-T2 is backwards compatible with DVB-T. This model is
            going to get a lot of interest in the UK where DVB-T and
            DVB-T2 are both used.
            The specs for the TV uHAT are :
            DVB-T 5,6,7,8 MHz
            DVB-T2 1.7, 5,6,7,8 MHz
            VHF Band III and UHF Bands IV and V
            AIUI this covers all current DVB-T and T2 broadcast standards
            on-the-air around the world.

       23rd Oct 2018 at 12:41 pm
       One question – does the TV uHAT use PID filtering to only send PIDs
       requested over the SPI interface, or can it stream the full
       40.25Mbs DVB-T2 mux across?
       If the latter then all 5 UK HD main services on PSB 3/BBC B can be
       received with a single tuner. If the former, then we may hit issues
       doing this if there is a limit on bandwidth / number of PIDS that
       can be filtered?
       These days most USB 2.0 tuners allow a whole mux to be carried over
       the USB interface, I just wondered if SPI allowed the same on a Pi?

            Hi Stephen,
            Yes, it can record the whole mux, therefore as you say it’s
            possible to record BBC One HD, BBC Two HD, ITV HD, Channel 4
            HD and Channel 5 HD simultaneously with just the one tuner.

                 It doesn’t use PID filtering apparently. On the

            I’m wondering the same thing. Putting solder pads for an IR
            TSOP would have been a neat idea (to allow for IR remote
            control to be added) – but I think that would require three
            pads (VCC,0V and Data)
            I’d assumed they were for testing – but would be great to
            know?
            I know in Europe powered indoor aerials/antennae with built in
            amps powered by 5V on the RF feed are widespread – could it be
            a way of injecting 5V to the RF feed? (They aren’t common in
            the UK and +5V outputs on STBs are unusual as they aren’t part
            of the Freeview receiver spec AFAIK)

            The entire multiplex can be streamed over SPI – so assuming

            ‘a lot’

            issues over cabled network connections to both a Pi Zero and a

       This is a great peace of hardware! Also works in Germany and France
       (non-encrypted DVB-T/T2 channels), BUT:
       1. the frequencies list for Germany that comes with tvheadend is
       outdated. You can instead add the DVB-T2 frequencies for your
       region (tables in https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVB-T2_HD) manually
       in the tvheadend web frontend: Login, Configuration -> DVB inputs
       -> Muxes -> Add (or Edit), Change delivery system to DVB-T2
       (France: DVB-T), add frequency in Hertz, bandwidth 8 MHz, set the
       other parameters to AUTO, status to PEND, then save/create. Then,
       in menu DVB inputs -> Services -> Map Services -> map all
       multiplexes to individual TV channels.
       2. viewing German DVB-T2 HD channels on the Pi is not a pleasure:
       they are H.265 (HEVC) HD of which decoding is too much work even
       for a Pi 3+ (best results I got with Kodi), but it can be used as a
       PVR or to stream via network to a remote Kodi or App. French TNT
       channels (H.264) can be viewed well on the Pi 3.

            There has been a lot of work on optimising HEVC decoding – and

       H.264 720p (or even 480p) by using another computer (or Pi,
       preferabely)?
       The thing is that I can’t even watch the signal on my iPhone 4S,
       because the CPU is way to weak for the signal used here in germany
       (displays around 150% CPU usage in Kodi) and I wanted to watch the
       stream on a iPad 1 running iOS 5.1.1..
       Btw. the Raspberry Pi 3B is also too weak to receive & play (or is
       it due to Raspian?); hope your next Pi is compatible with the uHAT
       and is powerful enough to receive & play on the same deveice and
       maybe even scale down so that other old devices can be used for
       watching.

GoPiGo3 review

   shares
   Twitter Googleplus Email


   For the last couple of years, the GoPiGo has been one of the most
   impressive robot kits available for the Raspberry Pi.

   The build remains excellent for the latest version, GoPiGo3. Two
   3D-printed acrylic boards house a Raspberry Pi 3 and GoPiGo3 board. To
   this, you attach the motors, a wireless networking dongle, a battery
   pack, and a USB thumb drive.

   The full article can be found in The MagPi 60 and was written by Lucy
   Hattersley. WIN! One of two GoPiGo3 kits. Click here to enter

   The build of the robot is relatively complex (although with fewer steps
   than the GoPiGo2 kit it replaces). It took us 45 minutes to put in all
   the screws, washers, and posts that connect the various parts together.
   This build time is about three times as long as most kits we encounter.

   There are good photographic instructions, though, and we didn’t get
   stuck during the build process. More information on the build process
   can be found on the Dexter Industries website.

   You might be wondering why it comes with a wireless dongle when the
   Raspberry Pi 3 has wireless built in. That’s because GoPiGo3 broadcasts
   its own wireless hotspot, so the minute you switch it on, you can
   connect to it via a local network called GoPiGo.

   Thanks to this approach, as soon as you’ve finished the setup and
   inserted the eight batteries, it becomes an absolute breeze to start
   using the GoPiGo3. There’s a whole new DexterOS operating system to
   play with and it’s packed with features.

Hotspot robot

   The robot transmits its network called GoPiGo. You connect to this
   network, and point a web browser to bloxter.com. You don’t need
   internet access to do this. You can log into the network from a from a
   Windows, Mac, or Linux computer; a tablet or smartphone; and of course,
   another Raspberry Pi.

   The web interface starts with four options: Drive, Learn, Code in
   Bloxter, and Code in Python. Click Drive and you can move the robot
   around using the on-screen buttons. Tap Code in Bloxter and you can use
   Scratch-style blocks to control the robot. The Code in Python option
   lets you use a web-based Python IDE to program the robot with the
   GoPiGo3 software library (GitHub).

   You can use Scratch to control the GoPiGo, but you need to switch the
   OS over to Raspbian for Robots. We think DexterOS has the better
   solution with Bloxter and Python. Based on Google Blocky, Bloxter is
   similar enough to Scratch.

   On the whole, DexterOS is a slick solution that enables you to start
   controlling and programming the robot quickly. Perhaps more
   importantly, it combines the lessons and programming environment into
   one single space that doesn’t require an internet connection – the
   robot acts as a router. There are dozens of lessons covering movement,
   sensors, speakers, buzzers, and buttons.

Ready to teach

   There’s a lot here for teachers. The GoPiGo is a great tool for
   introducing robotics to a classroom. It’s relatively easy to set up,
   very easy to connect to from a wide range of computers, network
   independent, and packed full of tutorials for visual and text-based
   programming environments.

   The two motors have encoders built in, so you no longer have to attach
   these separately during the build. These act as tachometers, measuring
   the precise rotation of the wheels. The GoPiGo3 runs forward and
   backwards in a straight line, can move by precise amounts (such as 10
   cm or 5 in), and turn with degree precision. It’s a small thing that
   makes a massive difference to the experience of using a robot.

   There is a GoPiGo base kit for just $99. It includes the GoPiGo3 board,
   chassis, wheels, motors, encoders, and power battery pack. You need to
   add your own Raspberry Pi 3.

   We tested the $199 Starter Kit, which comes with a Raspberry Pi 3, mini
   WiFi dongle, GoPiGo servo package, distance sensor, microSD card (with
   DexterOS software), 8GB USB drive, and power supply. It’s a useful
   complete package, but we think the base kit would be sufficient if you
   already have many of the components.

   The 8GB USB drive is used to update the software. You add software
   updates to the USB drive, power up the GoPiGo robot, and it
   automatically updates its software – again, without the need to remove
   the SD card or connect to a network.

   Both kits will be available soon in the UK from ModMyPi.

   Dexter offers a range of accessories for the GoPiGo. The Starter Kit
   comes with a servo motor and distance sensor, but you can also add an
   ultrasonic distance sensor, sound sensor, buzzer, temperature and
   humidity sensors, camera, and line follower. You can find tutorials for
   each of the sensor projects in the GoPiGo3 documentation.

   There’s a lot about this robot that makes it ideal for the classroom.
   Aside from the integrated lessons and programming environment, it’s a
   sturdy build. We’d wager it can take quite a few knocks.

   Even if you’re not a student or a teacher, it’s a great robot kit. The
   built-in encoders make it more accurate than other robots, and there
   are plenty of holes on the board for adding your own custom equipment.
   We’ve got a lot of time for GoPiGo3, and we intend to spend a lot of
   time experimenting with it. Well done Dexter!

Last word

   5/5

   One of the best robotics kits you can buy, especially for teachers.
   DexterOS is delightful, bringing programming and learning into one
   space. Creating its hotspot frees the robot from network limitations.
