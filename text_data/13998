   We categorise calls by type (debt collection, serious number,
   sweepstakes, etc.) and give the number in question a tellows score,
   which indicates whether a number is trustworthy or suspicious, helping
   you to decide whether or not to take the call.

   We've all had to deal with the same thing. Your phone rings 24/7 and
   shows no sign of stopping, but if ever you should pick up, all you hear
   is the incessant yabbering of a telemarketer or nothing at all. You're
   infuriated by the anonymous calls jamming your phone line. Is there
   some way of finding out who is on the other end? Do you pick up or
   leave it ringing? Who is calling?
   Sound familiar? There are thousands of people asking the same question
   every day. In response to this universal problem, tellows functions as
   an online database of telephone numbers associated with spam and scam
   activity reported by you, our users. By sharing your experiences with
   unknown numbers, you'll be providing vital warning information to other
   users unsure about whether or not to trust a certain caller. The more
   information is shared, the bigger the database grows and thus the
   chance of finding out who's at the end of that anonymous call becomes
   higher and higher. Thanks to the tellows app you can identify unknown
   callers on your iPhone and Android! Whilst you are at it, take a look
   at our various other useful tools in our tellows shop today. Here at
   tellows.com, not only can we provide up-to-date information on regional
   nuisance-call trends and currently active numbers with the heatmap, we
   also pinpoint the origin of your call and display it on a map by
   identifying the prefix.Used by over 200,000 people daily, tellows
   provides its services to people in over 47 countries, but tellows.com
   is geared specifically towards those residing in North America. Want to
   hear more? We have some light reading material that might be of
   interest to you. Check out our tellows blog for news on the latest
   scams, tellows products and updates in telecoms regulations that affect
   you or grab a copy of our free tellows magazine,which came together
   after our many years of experience on the subject of telephone terror
   and scams. This not only includes important background information
   about phone fraud but the methodology behind it.

Where does the information on telephone numbers come from?

   Huge amounts of data are entered into tellows sites worldwide each day
   - further comments on existing numbers as well as entirely new number
   profiles from first-time searches - all thanks to our users. User
   contributions are key to tellows' central function: the tellows score.
   Each time information on a number is given, the information is put
   through a complex algorithm to generate a trustworthiness rating, on a
   scale of 1-9. The respective score is clearly displayed at the top of
   the profile page for each number, making identifying an unknown caller
   possible in a matter of seconds and saving you not only time, but the
   frustration of dealing with annoying sales calls.
