Chicken Kale White Bean Soup

Peach Clafoutis & Vanilla Creme Fraiche

   I have made more variations of this soup than I can count. It’s hearty
   and flavorful with the soul-soothing goodness of chicken broth. This
   time I’ve made this with Jennie-O ground chicken, which is browned with
   onions and garlic and…

Chicken Kale White Bean Soup

   I have made more variations of this soup than I can count. It’s hearty
   and flavorful with the soul-soothing goodness of chicken broth. This
   time I’ve made this with Jennie-O ground chicken, which is browned with
   onions and garlic and simmered with spicy chile de arbol and fragrant
   lemon zest. I guarantee this soup will […]

Cardamom Cinnamon Rolls

   I like cinnamon, but I LOVE cardamom. I never understood why rolls only
   had to have cinnamon in them, why not add other complementary spices
   that go well with cinnamon? I’m known to sneak cardamom into desserts
   whenever I can so, of course, I had to put a cardamom twist on my
   favorite cinnamon roll […]

Strawberry Snacks

   Summer is right around the corner and that means strawberry season is
   upon us! Fragrant red California strawberries are everywhere. Our
   family will be snacking on strawberries all summer since they’re low in
   sugar and high in vitamin C. It is a great treat, especially for kids.
   My 7 month old already loves gnawing on […]

Granola-Crusted Yogurt Fruit Tart

   So this looks pretty impressive right? Well, the reality is that this
   Granola-Crusted Yogurt Fruit Tart is just a granola, yogurt and fruit
   parfait. For brunch entertaining, I love the idea of a simple classic
   breakfast dish reformatted into something more elevated and elegant.
   The crust is a simple granola recipe that is baked into […]

Adzuki bean brownies

   These brownies have no flour or refined sugar. Adzuki (also known as
   red beans) replace all the flour you would ordinarily find in brownies.
   You would never know it. As dense as beans sound, they offer a fluffy
   texture that lightens the brownie batter, much like wheat flour does. I
   absolutely love adzuki beans and they are so nutritious but if you
   can’t find any or don’t want to go through the hassle of cooking them
   from dried beans, you can substitute with black beans. These are
   decadent, fudgey and rich in that chocolate that I know you crave!

Deviled Eggs

   These are not your traditional deviled eggs, but they have classic
   deviled egg flavors, and in my opinion– better texture. I just love the
   velvety and thick runny egg yolk, so I thought why turn them into
   crumbly hard yolks only to smooth them out again with mayo? Also, these
   are easier to make. Each […]

Visiting Bath, England

   Our journey continues onto Somerset, just about 97 miles west of
   London, to a little town called Bath. As you might know, it’s best
   known for its Roman Baths which were once used for public bathing and
   now considered one of the best preserved Roman sites in the world. And
   in a town as small […]

Clams in Spicy Tomato and Fennel Soup

   Clams are often prepared steamed in white wine and aromatics like
   garlic, but I think clams cooked in tomatoes aren’t given enough
   attention. The combination of briny clam juice with acidic and sweet
   tomato soup is just phenomenal.
