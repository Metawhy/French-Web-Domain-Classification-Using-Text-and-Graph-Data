Academic Standards Policies

   Academic Standards Policies

   It is expected that students will complete all examinations,
   assessments, and assignments as described in the Program Admission
   Requirements and Course Syllabus for the program of study. Below are
   the general Academic Standards applicable for all the programs offered
   at the Institute:

Attendance

   1) Students must regularly attend classes at ILAC. See Course Syllabus
   for details.

   2) If there are extenuating circumstances concerning a student’s
   absence, the regional ambassador should be notified as soon as
   possible. It is the student’s own responsibility to stay current with
   the course material and course curriculum and to “catch up” on any
   missed classes regardless of the reason for absence. By way of example,
   skipping or missing a class where a test or an in-class assignment was
   announced will not excuse a student from that test or assignment.

   3) Regular attendance is taken for each class and both absenteeism and
   lateness will be recorded on the attendance sheet and by the Academic
   Department. Students who have missed three or more consecutive days
   will be placed on the ‘Non-Attending List’ and may not be guaranteed a
   place in their previous class. Upon return to ILAC students on the
   ‘Non-Attending List’ will need to speak with an academic ambassador
   prior to being allowed to attend further classes. While the Institute
   will seek to be consistent and reasonable in its approach to deciding
   what constitutes a valid reason for an absence, the Institute’s
   Director of Studies will have decision-making discretion in this
   process. The Institute will seek to balance the validity of the
   student’s excuse with the importance of the course material missed.

   4) The Director of Studies remedies will be governed by the
   requirements of provincial governments and any other regulatory
   requirements, to which the Institute is bound, as well as The
   Institute’s Discipline Policy and best practices in the circumstances.

   5) Completion of the course is contingent upon attending a minimum of
   80% of the classes in each 4-week term. Students who fail to meet this
   requirement will be required to repeat the level. Absences are tracked
   as follows: missing part of a day = a half-day absence, while missing
   an entire day is a full-day absence.

   6) All vacation requests must be received in writing with 4 weeks’
   notice and must be a minimum of two weeks in length. The request must
   be approved by the appropriate regional ambassador. ILAC is not
   responsible for travel plans you make if your request is not approved.
   If you would like to stay longer at ILAC, please speak to your regional
   ambassador before the next term begins so that we can ensure there will
   be space for you during the next term. If you request a vacation with
   less than 4 weeks’ notice due to an unexpected situation, you will be
   required to pay a non-refundable administration fee of $100 and show
   proof of your situation. For example, if your parents are coming to
   visit and you intend to travel with them, we need to see a photocopy of
   their plane tickets. Vacation forms can be filled out online and are
   available at: http://www.ilac.com/vacations/.

   7) Upon successful completion of the program of study, students will be
   issued a Certificate stating their name, graduation date, and ILAC
   language level upon graduation. This is contingent upon full payment of
   all tuition and fees (as applicable).


Make-up Tests, Late Assignments

   1) Make-up tests, in lieu of tests missed due to illness or other
   permissible circumstances are not offered at ILAC. However, any student
   who is unable to write a test at the scheduled time may speak to their
   regional ambassador or a member of the academic department to request a
   review of their academic history.

   2) Students are expected to complete assigned work in the time
   allotted. Late assignments are NOT accepted, unless arrangements have
   been made with an instructor or member of the academic department


Plagiarism (See also “Discipline Policy”)

   1) Plagiarism is the act of submitting work that is, in whole or in
   substantial part, someone else’s work, and representing it to be your
   own. Examples of plagiarism include, but are not limited to, the
   following:

   (a) copying previously published work;

   (b) copying another student’s work;

   (c) reviewing materials or works from mailboxes, printers, faculty
   desks or other sources, and adopting those works as your own; and

   (d) using paid or unpaid services or other people to complete one’s
   assignments.

   2) Students are expected to acknowledge the sources of ideas and
   expressions they use in essays, reports, assignments etc. Failure to do
   so constitutes plagiarism and is subject to academic penalty. Students
   who knowingly loan work to be copied, in whole or in part, by another
   student, for which a grade is assigned, are equally at fault in cases
   where plagiarism has occurred, and may also be open to academic
   sanction.



Cheating (See also “Discipline Policy”)

   1) Cheating is defined as any deliberate attempt to obtain credit
   through the use of deceit or dishonest methods. Examples of such
   behaviour include, but are not limited to, the following:

   (a) passing exam papers/solutions to another student;

   (b) repeatedly looking at other students’ papers;

   (c) discussing or whispering of answers during a test;

   (d) submitting research reports in which no research took place; and

   (e) writing answers on a desktop.

   (f) collaboration where collaboration is expressly prohibited, whether
   or not that collaboration occurs online or otherwise (and despite the
   fact that collaboration will generally be encouraged by ILAC, in order
   to foster learning).

   2) Cheating offences are subject to academic penalty.


Academic Penalty (See also “Discipline Policy”)

   1) Academic penalties often begin with the awarding of a zero on the
   assignment/project/test for the first offence and a notification, in
   writing, of the offence. This notification is copied to the instructor,
   regional ambassador, and academic department and is kept in the
   student’s file. A subsequent offence may result in removal from the
   course and the possibility of complete dismissal/expulsion from the
   program.

   –

   Dismissal/Expulsion (See also “Discipline Policy”)

   1) Without limitation, a student may be dismissed/expelled from a
   program after review by the Director of Studies for one of the
   following reasons:

   (a) failing or not completing all core courses (determined by program)
   in which the student is registered;

   (b) failing any core course three (3) or more times and/or

   2) The Institute will seek to apply its policy of graduated discipline
   consistently, and in accordance with its “Discipline Policy”. A student
   is considered to have withdrawn from his/her program of study if the
   student:

   (a) has advised the Institute that he/she has withdrawn from the
   program by completing the Institute’s Withdrawal and Transfer Form
   and/or

   (b) has not complied with the Institute’s Academic Standards Policy
   and/or has not attended for four consecutive weeks for any reason,
   including absences for reason of sickness, accident, leave of absence,
   etc.


Grading Disagreements

   1) Where a student disagrees with a grade received or any decision
   resulting from application of the rules, policies, and regulations
   referenced in this Contract in its entirety, the student shall discuss
   the matter with Director of Studies in an attempt to resolve the
   problem.

   2) Both individual and/or group complaints should be handled as
   outlined above. Most complaints are resolved informally with the
   instructor or faculty member responsible for grading that student/group
   of students. Faculty members endeavour to be open and fair in dealing
   with students’ concerns, thus students are encouraged to speak with the
   faculty member(s) involved in the matter.

   3) Students have five (5) business days from the day they receive the
   grades to request a re-assessment of a grade.
   –

Appeals

   1) A student who feels there have been extenuating circumstances that
   adversely affected his/her academic outcome/progress may appeal, in
   writing, to a member of the academic department. A student who is
   dissatisfied with the decision of first instance may appeal to the
   Institute’s Director of Studies. Please refer to the Level Progression

Dispute Resolution Policy

   Toronto

   ILAC has created the following Dispute Resolution Policy to better
   attend to our students’ needs. The following terms meet the standards
   of Languages Canada.

The Student’s Responsibilities:

   The student must communicate his/her concern, in writing, to the
   relevant faculty member. Students are encouraged to address any
   concerns immediately, and seek to utilize the Student Support Services
   before partaking in the Dispute Resolution process. Students should
   also retain copies of any written correspondence he/she has with the
   Institute. Should the student be unable or unwilling to approach the
   faculty member, or should concerns remain unaddressed by said faculty
   member, the student may contact the Director of Studies in writing, who
   will assist in determining an appropriate resolution. Students making a
   complaint may make oral submissions and/or have a person present with
   him/her at all stages of proceedings that may make oral submissions on
   behalf of the student.


The Director of Studies/Student Services Manager Responsibilities:

   Within two (2) Business Days of the submission of the complaint, the
   Director of Studies (DOS)/Student Services Manager (SSM) must: (a) hear
   the student complaint; (b) if necessary, ensure the complaint is
   prepared in writing (either by the student or by alternate means); and
   (c) obtain the approval of both parties, evidenced by a signature,
   regarding the contents of the complaint or, if one or both parties
   object to the content, a list of concerns that such a party has.

   The DOS/SSM will investigate the merits of the complaint, which may
   include an in-depth discussion with the faculty or staff member(s), the
   complainant or any other students who may be involved. The DOS/SSM is
   responsible for identifying the appropriate person to address the
   complaint and for notifying the student(s) involved of the status of
   the complaint process. If the DOS/SSM is absent or named in the
   complaint, the VP, Academic & Strategic Partnerships and Managing
   Director or the Head of Operation and Sales Operations will assume
   responsibility for making a determination in respect of the student
   complaint.

   The faculty/staff member or DOS/SSM must record, in writing, all
   resolution plans/decisions, as well as the reasons for such
   resolutions/decisions. The original form outlining the
   decision/resolution must be signed by both the faculty/staff member and
   the student who filed the complaint. A copy of the form will be given
   to the student and the original will be filed in the student’s academic
   file. If the parties agree to a mutual resolution, such resolution must
   be implemented. The DOS/SSM must follow up to ensure the resolution
   resolves the student’s complaint in a satisfactory manner. A student
   who disagrees with the DOS/SSM’s assessment of the complaint may
   escalate his/her concerns to the VP, Academic & Strategic Partnerships
   and Managing Director or the Head of Operation and Sales Operations.

   Once the resolution is mutually resolved, the DOS/SSM and the student
   will close the complaint record by signing a declaration at the bottom
   of the resolution. Decisions will be made as soon as possible and the
   dispute process, including any appeals, will take no later than 45 days
   after the complaint was first received.


Meeting with Faculty/Staff Member:

   If the DOS/SSM finds that the student’s complaint has merit, that
   initial attempts to resolve the complaint have been unsuccessful, and
   that the complaint does not fall under another policy, the DOS/SSM will
   arrange a meeting with the faculty/staff member in order to resolve the
   complaint. The student who submitted the complaint will not attend this
   meeting.

   During or prior to the meeting between the student and the DOS/SSM, the
   DOS/SSM will provide the faculty/staff member with a detailed summary
   of the student’s complaints and concerns, and together the parties will
   develop a strategy to rectify the situation. A mutually agreed-upon
   timeframe will be established for addressing the complaint as well as
   for the faculty/staff member to submit follow-up reports regarding the
   progress of such resolution.

   After the meeting, the DOS/SSM will notify the student in writing that
   his/her complaint has been addressed with the faculty/staff member and
   requesting that the student report whether or not the situation has
   improved after the agreed-upon timeframe. The DOS/SSM will also
   follow-up with the faculty/staff member or students if they fail to
   provide feedback after the agreed-upon timeframe.


Further Investigation:

   If the problem has not been resolved, the Director of Studies/Student
   Services Manager may be required to further investigate the situation.
   If it becomes apparent that the complaint is an issue of management or
   discipline, the Director of Studies/ Student Services Manager will
   engage in appropriate activities to address the situation. Such
   activities may include training for the faculty member.

   In this case, the Director of Studies/Student Services Manager will
   report to the student, in writing, that the complaint has been
   investigated and is being addressed. Director of Studies/Student
   Services Manager must not provide specific details of the actions taken
   as this would violate the faculty member’s right to confidentiality in
   matters of a personal nature.

   Should a resolution not be possible, the matter can be referred to the
   Board of Directors of Languages Canada
   (http://www.languagescanada.ca/en/contact or 1-604-625-1532) for

Anti-Bullying / Anti-Harassment / Anti-Discrimination Policy

   Anti-Bullying / Anti-Harassment / Anti-Discrimination Policy

Scope of Policy

   1)   Who is bound: The Institution has adopted this Anti-Bullying,
   Anti-Harassment, and Anti-Discrimination Policy to ensure ethical and
   respectful employment practices and treatment for all students of the
   Institution, as well as employees.

   2)   Objective: The objective of this policy is to create a climate of
   understanding and mutual respect where each person feels a part of the
   Institution’s community.

   3)   Zero tolerance: The Institution will have a zero-tolerance policy
   for harassment or bullying. The Institution will not tolerate, ignore,
   or condone any form of discrimination or harassment and is committed to
   promoting appropriate standards of conduct at all times.

   4)   May result in dismissal/expulsion: All employees in the
   Institution’s family are responsible for respecting the dignity and
   rights of their co-workers and the students whom they educate. Students
   in turn are responsible for respecting the dignity and rights of their
   fellow students. Bullying and harassment are serious forms of employee
   and student misconduct which may result in disciplinary action up to
   and including discharge of an employee, and which may result in
   suspension or dismissal/expulsion of a student or a denial of admission
   to any prospective student.

   5)   Harassment-free workplace: The Institution will take any and all
   reasonable steps available to ensure a harassment-free environment,
   including barring the harasser from its facilities, where appropriate,
   or discontinuing business with harassers, as the case may be.


Application of Policies

   1)   Online bullying, harassment, and social media: Harassment and
   bullying will not be tolerated on or off campus to the extent that such
   conduct compromises a respectful and harassment-free environment at the
   Institution. For example, online (social media, e-mail, or otherwise)
   harassment or bullying by a student or Employee in our Institutional
   family will not be tolerated – and will be treated as if it occurred on
   campus.

   2)   Enumerated grounds: Without limitation, the following prohibited
   grounds of discrimination and any combination of these grounds will
   specifically not be tolerated, apart and aside from any harassment or
   bullying issue:

   a) Race;
   b) Citizenship;
   c) Sexual Orientation;
   d) Ancestry;
   e) Creed;
   f) Age;
   g) Place of Origin;
   h) Sex (including pregnancy);
   i) Marital Status;
   j) Colour;
   k) Gender;
   l) Family Status;
   m) Ethnic Origin;
   n) Disability

   3)   Right to contract equally: Every person having legal capacity has
   a right to contract on equal terms without discrimination based on
   those items enumerated in paragraph 2 above.

   4)   Equal treatment in employment: Every person has a right to equal
   treatment with respect to employment without discrimination or
   harassment based on those items enumerated in paragraph 2 above.

   5)   “Bullying” standards may be adopted which go beyond any
   legislation that is in place or which has been introduced as draft
   legislation in British Columbia, in order to determine whether
   instances of “bullying” (which may fall short of or be different from
   “harassment”) have occurred.

   6)   Obligation to Report: Staff and students must report any alleged
   form of discrimination, harassment, or bullying to the Regional
   Ambassador, Academic Ambassador, Instructor, or Director of Studies as
   soon as they become aware of an issue.

   7)   Discrimination: Discrimination, as used in this Policy, is any
   practice or behaviour, whether intentional or not, which has a negative
   impact on an individual or group because of personal characteristics or
   circumstances unrelated to the person’s abilities or the employment or
   service issue in question (e.g., disability, sex, race, sexual
   orientation). Discrimination may arise as a result of direct
   differential treatment or it may result from the unequal effect of
   treating individuals and groups in the same way. Either way, if the
   effect of the behaviour on the individual is to withhold or limit full,
   equal and meaningful access to goods, services, facilities, employment,
   housing accommodation or contracts available to other members of
   society, it is discrimination.

   8)   Duty to accommodate: This refers to the legal obligation of an
   organization to take steps to eliminate disadvantage caused by
   systemic, attitudinal, or physical barriers that unfairly exclude
   individuals or groups protected under the applicable British Columbia
   Human Rights legislation and any regulations thereto. It also includes
   an obligation to meet the special needs of individuals and groups
   protected by any such regulation and legislation unless meeting such
   needs would create undue hardship.

   9)   Definitions:

   a) “Bullying”: means the severe or repeated use by one or more pupils
   of a written, verbal, electronic or other form of expression, a
   physical act or gesture or any combination of them if it is directed at
   another person if it has the effect of or is reasonably intended to
   have the effect of:i) causing physical or emotional harm to another
   person or damage to the another person’s property,

   i) causing physical or emotional harm to another person or damage to
   the another person’s property,

   ii) placing another person in reasonable fear of harm to himself or
   herself or damage to his or her property,

   iii) creating a hostile environment at the Institution for another
   person,

   iv) infringing on the legal rights of another person at the
   Institution, or

   v) materially and substantially disrupting the education process or the
   orderly operation of the Institution; (“intimidation”)

   b) “Employee”: For the purpose of this policy, the term employee
   includes: full- time, part-time, temporary, probationary and casual
   employees, co-op students, volunteers, job applicants, staff,
   contractors, and consultants working for the Institution;

   c) “Student”: means student or prospective student of the International
   Language Academy of Canada;

   d) “Equal Treatment”: Equal treatment is treatment that brings about an
   equality of results and that may, in some instances, require different
   treatment. For example, to give all employees equal treatment in
   entering a building, it may be necessary to provide a ramp or an
   elevator for an employee who requires the use of a wheelchair; ande)
   “Harassment”: Means improper comment or conduct based on one or more of
   the prohibited grounds listed in applicable British Columbia Human
   Rights legislation and regulations thereto, that a person knows or
   ought to know would be unwelcome, offensive, embarrassing or hurtful.

   e) “Harassment”: Means improper comment or conduct based on one or more
   of the prohibited grounds listed in applicable British Columbia Human
   Rights legislation and regulations thereto, that a person knows or
   ought to know would be unwelcome, offensive, embarrassing or hurtful.

   10)   Discipline: The Institution will investigate any and all
   allegations of harassment promptly, in accordance with the law, and
   free from reprisal.

   11)   Where to report: See the Director of Studies immediately if there
   are any questions or concerns about this policy

Non-Disparagement Policy

   Non-Disparagement Policy

   1)   Consideration: In consideration for delivery of the programs and
   other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
   which is hereby acknowledged by all current Students;

   2)   “Disparagement” for the purposes of this contract, shall generally
   refer to negative remarks about the Institution which are made
   maliciously or recklessly (including all of those persons covered under
   this policy) or without taking reasonable steps to verify the truth of
   such remarks prior to having made them.

   3)   Who is bound: Subject only to Canadian law held to be applicable
   in any province (including but without limitation the enabling
   legislation governing private career schools or institutions and the
   Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms if/where held to applicable),
   all students shall be bound by this non-disparagement policy. Adhering
   to the policy is a condition of enrolment.

   4)   Purpose of policy: The Institution has a reputation for
   excellence. The Institution is a private institution operating multiple
   locations in various provinces across Canada, and is committed to
   maintaining high standards in teaching and in ensuring that the value
   of International Language Academy of Canada’s credential remains
   strong.

   5)   Social media: With the popularity of social media (Facebook,
   YouTube, Twitter, etc.) students, and alumni of the Institution and all
   its affiliates, can communicate in a way that they have never done so
   before. The Institution applauds the fact that students and alumni have
   new opportunities to network for employment in their chosen vocation,
   and can communicate with each other socially. The Institution is
   confident that this will contribute to the Institution’s long-standing
   reputation in the marketplace.

   6)   Reputation is a two-way street: Students derive significant
   benefit from being an alumnus of International Language Academy of
   Canada. At the same time, the Institution is ultimately “defined” by
   the “quality” of its graduates i.e. where they end up working, how they
   are putting their skills to the test in the workforce, and whether they
   are happy with their chosen vocation. The Institution and its students
   have a common interest in preserving and protecting the integrity and
   image of the Institution and all its affiliates.

   7)   Specific undertakings of student: With the above in mind, students
   shall undertake to do the following:

   a) Refrain from making any public statement or statements, through
   social media or otherwise, about the Institution or any of its
   affiliates, which would be considered inaccurate, unduly critical or
   derogatory, or libellous, or which may tend to unfairly injure the
   reputation of the Institution or any of its affiliates;

   b) Refrain from making any public statement or statements, through
   social media or otherwise, that would be considered inaccurate, unduly
   critical or derogatory, or libellous, or which may tend to unfairly
   injure the reputation of another (and without limitation) existing or
   former student, alumni, instructor, or staff member of the Institution;

   c) Report to the Institution immediately, the publication of any unduly
   critical, derogatory, or libellous statement or statements, or
   statement/s which may tend to unfairly injure the reputation of the
   Institution or any of its affiliates, through social media or
   otherwise. Such reporting shall include the author or authors of such
   publication, and all other specifics known to the reporting student;

   d) Report to the Institution immediately, the publication of any
   inaccurate, unduly critical or derogatory, or libellous statement or
   statements tending to unfairly injure the reputation of another (and
   without limitation) existing or former student, alumni, instructor, or
   staff member of the Institution or any of its affiliates. Such
   reporting shall include the author or authors of such publication, and
   all other specifics known to the reporting student.

   e) Refrain from disparagement of the Institution or any of its
   affiliates in any other form that would reasonably be considered to
   bring the Institution or any of its affiliates, and without limitation,
   its faculty, staff, students or alumni, into disrepute;

   f) Familiarize themselves with any other policies which bind them while

   other sanctions as appropriate, may result from non-compliance with
   this Policy.

Discipline Policy

   Discipline Policy

   1)   All students are expected to conduct themselves in a dignified and
   professional manner.

   2)   Students may be suspended or dismissed/expelled, depending on the
   severity and/or degree of their “Misconduct”: Misconduct is defined as,
   and without limitation:

   a) conduct which disrupts or in any material respect compromises the
   Institute or any of its students, including the administration of the
   program (including but without limitation any act or threatened act of
   violence, failure to cooperate with an inclusion or accommodation
   policy of the Institution);

   b) student performance bringing discredit on the professional,
   academic, or ethical standards of the institution;

   c) academic failure;

   d) poor attendance i.e. attendance which falls below any program
   approval requirements, or poor participation (without medical excuse
   that gives rise to the legal need for accommodation);

   e) conduct which interferes with the legal rights of other students
   and/or the Institution, its staff, agents, or employees

   f) repeated contravention of the Institute’s policies as set out in
   this Student Enrolment Contract and amended from time to time as the
   Institution deems necessary, or pursuant to applicable laws and/or
   regulations;

   g) failure to pay required fees as set out in the student’s signed
   contract;

   h) contravention of the performance requirements or other rules and/or
   guidelines as they may apply to the student; and

   i) distribution of materials within the campus and to the Institute’s
   students that have not been approved by the Institute (such as
   brochures, 3rd party advertisements, promotional materials, political
   or religious materials, etc.)

   3)   Repeated failure to abide by Institute’s policies, which may be
   amended from time to time as the Institution deems necessary or
   pursuant to applicable laws and/or regulations, is grounds for
   dismissal/withdrawal. Note that contravention of some school’s policies
   may lead to immediate dismissal/expulsion from the program depending on
   the severity of the contravention (see paragraph 5 below).

   4)   The Institute may, at its sole discretion and consistent with
   applicable laws and/or regulations, consider a Suspension prior to the
   possible dismissal/expulsion of the student.

   5)   Certain types of serious misconduct will lead to the immediate
   dismissal/expulsion of the student on a “zero tolerance” basis. Such
   conduct includes, but without limitation,

   a) the use of alcohol or drugs;

   b) violent and/or threatening behavior toward another student,
   employee, faculty member, or visitor on campus;

   c) dishonesty by the student relating to academic testing or
   credentials, or any dishonesty going to the academic integrity of the
   Institution.

   6)   Harassment or Discrimination – International Language Academy of
   Canada does not condone harassment or discrimination of any student,
   staff, employees, or agents. Students who engage in harassing or
   discrimination are subject to immediate suspension pending
   investigation. Any student deemed by the International Language Academy
   of Canada’s investigators as having engaged in harassing or
   discriminatory activities contrary to any applicable laws and
   regulations may be subjected to immediate dismissal/expulsion.

   will be required to make restitution to replace or fully repair the
   property.

   8)   Fee refunds will be governed by the provisions of this contract
   and applicable laws and/or regulations as prescribed. However, where
   International Language Academy of Canada has no legal
   requirement/obligation to refund tuition or any portion of a student’s
   tuition to any student who has been expelled (or suspended, where the
   suspension is long enough such that the student has lost a significant
   amount of time or opportunity that would otherwise have been spent in
   course study), International Language Academy of Canada will have no
   obligation to refund tuition or any part of that student’s tuition.

   9)   A sanction of suspension or dismissal/expulsion will be recorded
   on a student’s academic record and transcript.

   10)   Notification – Students who are expelled for any reason will be

   dismissal/expulsion must file their appeal with the Institution within
   5 days of the notification having been received by the student

   12)   ILAC may, at its sole discretion, determine that a restorative
   process is warranted in lieu of or in tandem with any of the above
   forms of discipline that it seeks to impose. A restorative process is
   one which emphasizes repairing the harm caused or revealed by unjust
   behavior through an inclusive or cooperative process.

   to providing customer service and to ensuring equal access and
   participation for people with disabilities. We believe in integration
   and we are committed to treating people with disabilities in a way that
   respects their dignity, independence, integration and equal
   opportunity. We will meet the needs of people with disabilities by
   removing and preventing barriers to accessibility and by meeting our
   accessibility requirements under Ontario’s accessibility laws,
   including Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) and
   Integrated Accessibility Standards (O. Reg. 191/11).


   Definitions

   Disability means:

   (a)             any degree of physical disability, infirmity,
   malformation or disfigurement that is caused by bodily injury, birth
   defect or illness and, without limiting the generality of the
   foregoing, includes diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, a brain injury, any
   degree of paralysis, amputation, lack of physical co-ordination,
   blindness or visual impediment, deafness or hearing impediment,
   muteness or speech impediment, or physical reliance on a guide dog or
   other animal or on a wheelchair or other remedial appliance or device,

   (b)             a condition of mental impairment or a developmental
   disability,

   (c)             a learning disability, or a dysfunction in one or more
   of the processes involved in understanding or using symbols or spoken
   language,

   (d)             a mental disorder, or

   (e)             an injury or disability for which benefits were claimed
   or received under the insurance plan established under the Workplace
   Safety and Insurance Act, 1997; (“handicap”)

   Barrier means anything that prevents a person with a disability from
   fully participating in all aspects of society because of his or her
   disability, including a physical barrier, an architectural barrier, an
   information or communications barrier, an attitudinal barrier, a
   technological barrier, a policy or a practice;

   Personal Assistive Devices is a piece of equipment a person with a
   disability uses to help them with daily living (e.g., a wheelchair,
   screen reader, hearing aid, cane or walker, an oxygen tank).

   Personal Supports is used by persons with disabilities that enable them
   to carry out the activities of daily living and allow access to care
   and services. For example, walkers, personal oxygen tank,
   power-mobility devices such as power wheelchairs or scooters.

   Service Animals are animals used by people with many different kinds of
   disabilities, such as vision loss, epilepsy, autism and anxiety
   disorder. Examples of service animals include dogs used by people who
   are blind, hearing alert animals for people who are deaf, deafened or
   hard of hearing, and animals trained to alert an individual to an
   oncoming seizure and lead them to safety. An animal is considered a
   service animal if it wears a harness, vest or other visual indicator or
   the person with a disability provides documentation from a regulated
   health professional.

   Support Person is someone who accompanies a person with a disability to
   help with communication, mobility, personal care or medical needs or
   with access to goods or services. A support person may be a paid
   professional, a volunteer, a family member or friend.


   Training

   In accordance with the Accessibility Standards Regulation, ILAC
   undertakes to train all members of its organization in these
   requirements and will ensure that all employees, volunteers, directors,
   board members and owners and anyone who provides goods, services or
   facilities to ILAC’s customers have received training in these
   procedures as it relates to their specific roles. The training will be
   offered within the probation period after the effective hiring, or
   whenever there is a need.

   ILAC will provide written notice to each member on an ongoing basis
   when changes to the policies, practices and procedures governing the
   provision of accessibility standards. Revised training will be provided
   in the event of changes to legislation, procedures and/or practices.


   Procedures and Commitment

   ILAC has outlined its procedures and commitment as below:
    1. ILAC will communicate with people with disabilities in ways that
       take into account their disability;
    2. When asked, ILAC will provide information about the organization
       and its services, including public safety information, in
       accessible formats or with communication supports;
    3. Where a customer or guest has specific requirements for alternate
       means communication and requests that alternate forms of
       communication be used, ILAC will accommodate the person with
       disability with whatever means necessary to allow proper and
       courteous communication. This may include, but is not limited to
       communication in writing by email, communication by telephone,
       reading information to the person or providing large font written
       communications;
    4. Where ILAC is unable to supply the communication in a format that
       meets the person’s needs, an explanation will be provided to the
       person with disability giving the reasons why the person’s
       communication needs cannot be accommodated;
    5. Wherever possible, ILAC’s internet Website and its content will be
       created in a way that considers how assistive devices, such as
       screen readers, speech and input systems and other devices, operate
       and how people with disabilities use them to allow the site to be
       accessible to people with disabilities;
    6. We will notify employees, potential hires, volunteers and the
       public that accommodations can be made during recruitment and
       hiring;
    7. We will notify staff that supports are available for those with
       disabilities. We will put in place a process to develop individual
       accommodation plans for employees and students. Where needed, we
       will also provide customized emergency information to help an
       employee and students with a disability during an emergency;
    8. We will modify or remove an existing policy that does not respect
       and promote the dignity, independence, integration and equal
       opportunity of people with disabilities;
    9. Where a person with a disability is accompanied by a Service
       Animal, the Service Animal will be permitted in all areas of the
       premises, except where excluded by law. Such laws could include the
       Food Safety and Quality or the Health Protection and Promotion Act;
   10. Where the Service Animal is a breed that is restricted by the
       province or municipality, the provisions of the Provincial or
       municipal law will prevail;
   11. The Service Animal of a person with a disability must be registered
       with ILAC at Front Desk;
   12. The employee, volunteer, customer or student that is accompanied by
       a Service Animal is responsible for maintaining care and control of
       Service Animal at all times while on ILAC premises;
   13. If a health and safety concern presents itself, for example in the
       form of a severe allergy to the animal, ILAC will make all
       reasonable efforts to meet the needs of all individuals;
   14. If ILAC staff or volunteer is not able to easily identify that the
       animal is a service animal, he/she can kindly ask the person to
       provide documentation (e.g. template, letter, form) from a
       regulated health professional that confirms that the person needs
       the service animal for reasons relating to their disability;
   15. Assistive devices such as a cane, a walker, a personal oxygen tank,
       a wheelchair or mobility scooter are permitted to be used in all
       common areas of the property. ILAC requests that all compressed gas
       or oxygen be registered with the Front desk to properly advise the
       Fire Department in the event of a fire emergency;
   16. Where elevators are not present and where an individual requires
       assistive device for the purpose of mobility, service will be
       provided in a location that meets the needs of the customer;
   17. In the event of planned or unexpected disruption of regular service
       for customers, ILAC will communicate this information to each
       person with a disability by such means as is appropriate for each
       individual;
   18. When a notification needs to be posted, it will include information
       about the reason for the disruption, its anticipated length of
       time, and a description of alternative facilities or services, if
       available;
   19. If a customer with a disability is accompanied by a Support Person,
       ILAC will ensure that both persons are allowed to enter the
       premises together and that the customer is not prevented from
       having access to the Support Person;
   20. A Support Person is subject to the same By-Laws and Rules of ILAC
       as a customer or guest;
   21. Where a person utilizes a Support Person and confidential
       information must be discussed, the person with the disability will
       be asked to consent to the presence of the Support Person during
       the discussion;
   22. The support person who accompanies the person with a disability due
       to health or safety reasons may be subjected to an admission and/or
       tuition fee.
   23. A Support Person may be requested by ILAC to protect the health and
       safety of the person with the disability or the health and safety
       of others on the premises;
   24. In case ILAC understands that a person with disability needs a
       support person to accompany he/she in its premises, before making a
       decision, ILAC will consult with the person with a disability to
       understand their needs, consider health or safety reasons based on
       available evidence and determine if there is no other reasonable
       way to protect the health or safety of the person or others on the
       premises;
   25. In such a situation, ILAC will waive the admission fee for the
       support person, if applicable.


   Emergency Communications

   Where a person’s disability might affect their ability to hear the fire
   alarm or voice communication system, or where the person with a
   disability may have difficulty in evacuating their suite in an
   emergency situation, ILAC will discuss the needs of each person with a
   disability with them individually to put into place an individual plan
   to handle the emergency situation.

   Once the individual emergency plan for each person with a disability
   has been established, ILAC and the person with a disability will adhere
   to that plan in an emergency situation.


   Feedback

   ILAC is committed to equal access and participation for people with
   disabilities who are working, learning or visiting at the school. We
   welcome your comments and feedback on any accessibility relating to the
   school. You can submit your comments and feedback by e-mailing

The Rider

   Toronto

   ATTENTION STUDENTS: A Rider is a condition or proviso added to
   something already said or decreed in a binding agreement, or which
   qualifies an existing agreement. The purpose of this Rider is to:

   (a) Discourage from entering our program those international students
   who seek to deceptively enter Canada on a study Visa i.e. under the
   false pretenses of studying at an approved institution—but whose intent
   it is to immediately seek a refund.

   (b) Eliminate from our program those international students who
   deceptively enter Canada on a study Visa but under the false pretenses
   of studying at an approved institution– but whose intent is other than
   to study at the institution.

   To the extent that the provisions below are inconsistent with or
   contradict any of the provisions in this Student Enrollment Contract,
   you acknowledge that the provisions below shall prevail:
    1. Deception: If an international student deceptively obtains his/her
       letter of acceptance issued by the institution to enter Canada or
       in a manner that is inconsistent with Canada’s immigration
       policies, the institution may retain up to 100% of the tuition paid
       by the student, or paid by any third party on behalf of the
       student.
    2. Misuse: If an international student otherwise misuses his/her
       letter of acceptance issued by the institution to enter Canada or
       in a manner that is inconsistent with Canada’s immigration
       policies, the institution may retain up to 100% of the tuition paid
       by the student, or paid by any third party on behalf of the
       student.
    3. Legal Limitations: Subject only to the limitations of applicable
       laws that govern the institution within the institution’s
       jurisdiction, the institution shall use its discretion to make a
       determination as to whether or not an international student has
       acted improperly as enumerated paragraphs 1 or 2 above.
    4. Third Party Agents: Where the institution makes a determination
       that an international student has acted improperly in accordance
       with paragraphs 1 or 2 above and that tuition should be withheld,
       and where that tuition was paid to a third party such as a reseller
       of the institution that operates outside of Canada, the student
       shall have no direct recourse to the institution in any event. For
       greater certainty, where the institution does not take issue with a
       tuition refund or partial tuition refund in such cases, the
       student’s sole and exclusive remedy is to seek redress from the
       agent in the jurisdiction where the funds were paid.
    5. Condition of Ongoing Enrollment: Where the institution subsequently
       discovers that a student has misused or misrepresented in a manner
       described in paragraphs 1 and 2 during the term of his/her
       enrollment, the student may be expelled at any time without the
       institution having to refund any portion of his/her tuition
       (independent of any other grounds of or reasons for prescribing
       discipline specifically enumerated in this Student Enrollment
       Contract or pursuant to the institution’s policies).
    6. Acknowledgement: An offending student acknowledges that by
       enrolling at the institution, he/she has taken away a spot from
       another prospective student to enroll, and denied that prospective
       student a training opportunity and denying the institution a
       revenue opportunity.
    7. Declaration: The institution encourages prospective students who
       seriously intend to study at the institution to further their
       education and pursue new opportunities in Canada. To that end, the
       potential students understand that they must be otherwise compliant
       with the laws of Canada and that understand the gravity of
       providing false information to Canada’s immigration authorities, to
       the institution, or to any other government agency. The institution
       provides the students with this link, among other resources, for
       their quick reference:
