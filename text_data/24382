   Cavaliers tail order batsman Ceon Heartman prepares to hit a ball but
   was instead clean bowled by Vikings pacer Roshan Hushman for a duck,
   during Sunday afternoon’s match in Greenland

   By Dean “The Sportsman” Greenaway

   When four times champs Cavaliers faced defending champions Vikings
   during Sunday’s play in the LIME Twenty 20 League in Greenland,
   everyone expected a Cavaliers walk over against a seemingly ‘depleted’
   Vikings Squad.

   However, the Vikings bowlers ploughed through the Cavaliers batting
   line up that had one of its most pathetic performances in the four
   times champs history, sending them to a humiliating defeat.

   “It was just a bad day—one of the worst I can probably recall in the
   batting—we just didn’t click at all,” Cavaliers captain Vishal Bharat
   pointed out.

   Vikings used Keelan Walker’s 63 and Roshan Hushman’s supporting 22, as
   the platform for reaching 195, after winning the toss and electing to
   bat but fell 15 runs short of their target of 220 runs. Cavaliers’
   Teddy Nankashore bagged 3-43 from three overs.

   Nankashore led Cavaliers’ charge with 72 including 10 fours but had no
   support from the anemic line up, that fell apart in the middle and they
   were bowled out for a paltry 111, with spinner Johnny Bailey bagging
   4-15. Hushman grabbed another 2-18.

   “We thought 195 was a below average total on this ground that we could
   get,” Bharat said. “I though they bowled well, but we didn’t do what we
   were supposed to do.”

   Vikings captain Vishal Munesar said they came with a plan because they
   knew Cavaliers would come hard at them and they inserted an extra
   bowler in the lineup.

   “The plan was to win the toss and bat, we did that—and wanted an
   opening partnership of over 60 and we did that too,” he explained. “Our
   target was 220, we fell away a little in the middle and came up short
   by 15 runs. We brought in a new fast bowler and we knew it would have
   been a surprise for them because they know all our fast bowlers—because
   they practice with them—but, they didn’t know him.”

   Royal Knights beat Police by eight wickets in the opening game. Police
   reached 177-7 in their 20 overs, thanks to Shem Stay’s 70 and Collis
   Fraser’s 69—but it wasn’t enough. Julian Sinclair snatched 3-16 and
   Winston Davis, 2-32.

   In reply, Royal Knights posted 178-2. Ryan Mangal had a knock of 49 not
   out and Richard Fredericks, 43. Police’s Dorian Auguste grabbed 2-41.
