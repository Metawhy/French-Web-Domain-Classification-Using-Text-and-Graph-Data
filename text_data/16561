   The estate of the late rapper Xxxtentacion is expected to release a new
   track by the artist on Friday, called “Royalty,” feeding a demand that
   shows no signs of slowing down a year after his death. A snippet of the
   song has been floating around the internet since April, and an
   Instagram account reportedly linked to the estate teased the release on
   Tuesday. The track will be included on a deluxe reissue of
   Xxxtentacion’s album "?,” which will come out July 26.

   Issued by Capitol Records, the forthcoming release will be the first
   major project since Xxx was murdered on June 18, 2018, during an
   ambush-robbery in South Florida. He was 20. A two-CD edition will
   feature the original album and its instrumentals, along with Xxx’s
   Christmas EP; a “bonus” disc includes “Royalty,” other new material,
   some remixes and voices memos. A booklet will include never-before-seen
   photos. There will also be an $80 triple LP version.

   The release will likely face comparisons with another posthumous
   record, by fellow Soundcloud rap star Lil Peep (who was born Gustav
   Åhr). A few days ago on the artist’s official Instagram account, Peep’s
   mother asked, “Who wants a new album with amazing unreleased Lil Peep
   music put together by Gus’ mom and the songs’ original collaborators?
   You have been asking for this, and I can’t wait to get it to you!” That
   will be Peep’s second post-death release.

   Xxxtentacion’s estate has so far only issued a few extant tracks, but
   his presence is all over the charts. Hitmaker JuiceWRLD just dropped a
   new track called “Run” that samples an unreleased Xxx track; the
   original version of "?” just jumped back into the top 50 of Billboard’s
   Top 200 album chart after hitting No. 1; it’s been on the chart for 69
   weeks. Xxxtentacion’s album “17" just cracked the top 100 on that same
   chart, part of a 98-week run that peaked at No. 2.

California invested heavily in solar power. Now there's so much that other
states are sometimes paid to take it

   By Ivan Penn

   June 22, 2017
   [energy_split_illo_color.gif]

   On 14 days during March, Arizona utilities got a gift from California:
   free solar power.

   Well, actually better than free. California produced so much solar
   power on those days that it paid Arizona to take excess electricity its
   residents weren’t using to avoid overloading its own power lines.

   ADVERTISEMENT

   It happened on eight days in January and nine in February as well. All
   told, those transactions helped save Arizona electricity customers
   millions of dollars this year, though grid operators declined to say
   exactly how much. And California also has paid other states to take
   power.

   The number of days that California dumped its unused solar electricity
   would have been even higher if the state hadn’t ordered some solar
   plants to reduce production — even as natural gas power plants, which
   contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, continued generating
   electricity.

   Solar and wind power production was curtailed a relatively small amount
   — about 3% in the first quarter of 2017 — but that’s more than double
   the same period last year. And the surge in solar power could push the
   number even higher in the future.

   Why doesn’t California, a champion of renewable energy, use all the
   solar power it can generate?

   The answer, in part, is that the state has achieved dramatic success in
   increasing renewable energy production in recent years. But it also
   reflects sharp conflicts among major energy players in the state over
   the best way to weave these new electricity sources into a system still
   dominated by fossil-fuel-generated power.

   Department of Water and Power. (Mel Melcon/Los Angels Times) [5x4] City
   officials and builders in Redondo Beach want a mixed-use development to
   replace the current natural gas facility. They say there is no need to
   overhaul the power plant when there is an abundance of clean
   alternatives. (Rick Loomis/Los Angeles Times)

   No single entity is in charge of energy policy in California. This has
   led to a two-track approach that has created an ever-increasing glut of
   power and is proving costly for electricity users. Rates have risen
   faster here than in the rest of the U.S., and Californians now pay
   about 50% more than the national average.

   Perhaps the most glaring example: The California Legislature has
   mandated that one-half of the state’s electricity come from renewable
   sources by 2030; today it’s about one-fourth. That goal once was
   considered wildly optimistic. But solar panels have become much more
   efficient and less expensive. So solar power is now often the same
   price or cheaper than most other types of electricity, and production
   has soared so much that the target now looks laughably easy to achieve.

   At the same time, however, state regulators — who act independently of
   the Legislature — until recently have continued to greenlight utility
   company proposals to build more natural gas power plants.

   Calilfornia to produce 100% of its electricity from clean energy
   sources such as solar and wind by 2045. (Luis Sinco/Los Angeles Times)

   These conflicting energy agendas have frustrated state Senate Leader
   Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles), who opposes more fossil fuel plants. He
   has introduced legislation that would require the state to meet its
   goal of 50% of its electricity from renewable sources five years
   earlier, by 2025. Even more ambitiously, he recently proposed
   legislation to require 100% of the state’s power to come from renewable
   energy sources by 2045.

   “I want to make sure we don’t have two different pathways,” de Leon
   said. Expanding clean energy production and also building natural gas
   plants, he added, is “a bad investment.”

   Environmental groups are even more critical. They contend that building
   more fossil fuel plants at the same time that solar production is being
   curtailed shows that utilities — with the support of regulators — are
   putting higher profits ahead of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

   “California and others have just been getting it wrong,” said Leia
   Guccione, an expert in renewable energy at the Rocky Mountain Institute
   in Colorado, a clean power advocate. “The way [utilities] earn revenue
   is building stuff. When they see a need, they are perversely
   [incentivized] to come up with a solution like a gas plant.”

   California and others have just been getting it wrong.

   — Leia Guccione, renewable energy expert at the Rocky Mountain
   Institute

   Regulators and utility officials dispute this view. They assert that
   the transition from fossil fuel power to renewable energy is
   complicated and that overlap is unavoidable.

   They note that electricity demand fluctuates — it is higher in summer
   in California, because of air conditioning, and lower in the winter —
   so some production capacity inevitably will be underused in the winter.
   Moreover, the solar power supply fluctuates as well. It peaks at
   midday, when the sunlight is strongest. Even then it isn’t totally
   reliable.

   Because no one can be sure when clouds might block sunshine during the
   day, fossil fuel electricity is needed to fill the gaps. Utility
   officials note that solar production is often cut back first because
   starting and stopping natural gas plants is costlier and more difficult
   than shutting down solar panels.

   heat water that powers steam generators. This solar thermal plant — one
   of the clean energy facilities that helps produce 10% of the state’s
   electricity. (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times)

   Eventually, unnecessary redundancy of electricity from renewables and
   fossil fuel will disappear, regulators, utilities and operators of the
   electric grid say.

   “The gas-fired generation overall will show decline,” said Neil Millar,
   executive director of infrastructure at CAISO, the California
   Independent System Operator, which runs the electric grid and shares
   responsibility for preventing blackouts and brownouts. “Right now, as
   the new generation is coming online and the older generation hasn’t
   left yet, there is a bit of overlap.”

   Utility critics acknowledge these complexities. But they counter that
   utilities and regulators have been slow to grasp how rapidly technology
   is transforming the business. A building slowdown is long overdue, they
   argue.

   Despite a growing glut of power, however, authorities only recently
   agreed to put on hold proposals for some of the new natural gas power
   plants that utilities want to build to reconsider whether they are
   needed.

   A key question in the debate is when California will be able to rely on
   renewable power for most or all of its needs and safely phase out
   fossil fuel plants, which regulators are studying.

   The answer depends in large part on how fast battery storage improves,
   so it is cheaper and can store power closer to customers for use when
   the sun isn’t shining. Solar proponents say the technology is advancing
   rapidly, making reliance on renewables possible far sooner than
   previously predicted, perhaps two decades or even less from now — which
   means little need for new power plants with a life span of 30 to 40
   years.

   Calibrating this correctly is crucial to controlling electricity costs.

   “It’s not the renewables that’s the problem. It’s the state’s renewable
   policy that’s the problem,” said Gary Ackerman, president of the
   Western Power Trading Forum, an association of independent power
   producers. “We’re curtailing renewable energy in the summertime months.
   In the spring, we have to give people money to take it off our hands.”
     __________________________________________________________________

   Not long ago, solar was barely a rounding error for California’s energy
   producers.

   In 2010, power plants in the state generated just over 15% of their
   electricity production from renewable sources. But that was mostly wind
   and geothermal power, with only a scant 0.5% from solar. Now that
   overall amount has grown to 27%, with solar power accounting for 10%,
   or most of the increase. The solar figure doesn’t include the hundreds
   of thousands of rooftop solar systems that produce an additional 4
   percentage points, a share that is ever growing.

   Behind the rapid expansion of solar power: its plummeting price, which
   makes it highly competitive with other electricity sources. In part
   that stems from subsidies, but much of the decline comes from the sharp
   drop in the cost of making solar panels and their increased efficiency
   in converting sunlight into electricity.

   The average cost of solar power for residential, commercial and
   utility-scale projects declined 73% between 2010 and 2016. Solar
   electricity now costs 5 to 6 cents per kilowatt-hour — the amount
   needed to light a 100-watt bulb for 10 hours — to produce, or about the
   same as electricity produced by a natural gas plant and half the cost
   of a nuclear facility, according to the U.S. Energy Information
   Administration.

   Fly over the Carrizo Plain in California’s Central Valley near San Luis
   Obispo and you’ll see that what was once barren land is now a sprawling
   solar farm, with panels covering more than seven square miles — one of
   the world’s largest clean-energy projects. When the sun shines over the
   Topaz Solar Farm, the shimmering panels produce enough electricity to
   power all of the residential homes in a city the size of Long Beach,
   population 475,000.

   Other large-scale solar operations blanket swaths of the Mojave Desert,
   which has increasingly become a sun-soaking energy hub. The Beacon
   solar project covers nearly two square miles and the Ivanpah plant
   covers about five and a half square miles.

   The state’s three big shareholder-owned utilities now count themselves
   among the biggest solar power producers. Southern California Edison
   produces or buys more than 7% of its electricity from solar generators,
   Pacific Gas & Electric 13% and San Diego Gas & Electric 22%.

   Similarly, fly over any sizable city and you’ll see warehouses,
   businesses and parking lots with rooftop solar installations, and many
   homes as well.

   With a glut of solar power at times, CAISO has two main options to
   avoid a system overload: order some solar and wind farms to temporarily
   halt operations or divert the excess power to other states.

   That’s because too much electricity can overload the transmission
   system and result in power outages, just as too little can.
   Complicating matters is that even when CAISO requires large-scale solar
   plants to shut off panels, it can’t control solar rooftop installations
   that are churning out electricity.

   CAISO is being forced to juggle this surplus more and more.

   In 2015, solar and wind production were curtailed about 15% of the time
   on average during a 24-hour period. That rose to 21% in 2016 and 31% in
   the first few months of this year. The surge in solar production
   accounts for most of this, though heavy rainfall has increased
   hydroelectric power production in the state this year, adding to the
   surplus of renewables.

   the plug California’s clean energy supply is growing so fast that solar
   and wind producers are increasingly being ordered to halt production.

   Even when solar production is curtailed, the state can produce more
   than it uses, because it is difficult to calibrate supply and demand
   precisely. As more homeowners install rooftop solar, for example, their
   panels can send more electricity to the grid than anticipated on some
   days, while the state’s overall power usage might fall below what was
   expected.

   This means that CAISO increasingly has excess solar and wind power it
   can send to Arizona, Nevada and other states.

   When those states need more electricity than they are producing, they
   pay California for the power. But California has excess power on a
   growing number of days when neighboring states don’t need it, so
   California has to pay them to take it. CAISO calls that “negative
   pricing.”

   Why does California have to pay rather than simply give the power away
   free?

   When there isn’t demand for all the power the state is producing, CAISO
   needs to quickly sell the excess to avoid overloading the electricity
   grid, which can cause blackouts. Basic economics kick in. Oversupply
   causes prices to fall, even below zero. That’s because Arizona has to
   curtail its own sources of electricity to take California’s power when
   it doesn’t really need it, which can cost money. So Arizona will use
   power from California at times like this only if it has an economic
   incentive — which means being paid.

   In the first two months of this year, CAISO paid to send excess power
   to other states seven times more often than same period in 2014.
   “Negative pricing” happened in an average of 18% of all sales, versus
   about 2.5% in the same period in 2014.

   Most “negative pricing” typically has occurred for relatively short
   periods at midday, when solar production is highest.

   But what happened in March shows how the growing supply of solar power
   could have a much greater impact in the future. The periods of
   “negative pricing” lasted longer than in the past — often for six hours
   at a time, and once for eight hours, according to a CAISO report.

   The excess power problem will ease somewhat in the summer, when
   electricity usage is about 50% higher in California than in the winter.

   But CAISO concedes that curtailments and “negative pricing” is likely
   to happen even more often in the future as solar power production
   continues to grow, unless action is taken to better manage the excess
   electricity.

   & Electric and Southern California Edison customers. (Mark Boster/Los
   Angeles Times)

   Arizona’s largest utility, Arizona Public Service, is one of the
   biggest beneficiaries of California’s largesse because it is next door
   and the power can easily be sent there on transmission lines.

   On days that Arizona is paid to take California’s excess solar power,
   Arizona Public Service says it has cut its own solar generation rather
   than fossil fuel power. So California’s excess solar isn’t reducing
   greenhouse gases when that happens.

   CAISO says it does not calculate how much it has paid others so far
   this year to take excess electricity. But its recent oversupply report
   indicated that it frequently paid buyers as much as $25 per
   megawatt-hour to get them to take excess power, according to the Energy
   Information Administration.

   That’s a good deal for Arizona, which uses what it is paid by
   California to reduce its own customers’ electricity bills. Utility
   buyers typically pay an average of $14 to $45 per megawatt-hour for
   electricity when there isn’t a surplus from high solar power
   production.
     __________________________________________________________________

   With solar power surging so much that it is sometimes curtailed, does
   California need to spend $6 billion to $8 billion to build or refurbish
   eight natural gas power plants that have received preliminary approval
   from regulators, especially as legislative leaders want to accelerate
   the move away from fossil fuel energy?

   The answer depends on whom you ask.

   ADVERTISEMENT

   Utilities have repeatedly said yes. State regulators have agreed until
   now, approving almost all proposals for new power plants. But this
   month, citing the growing electricity surplus, regulators announced
   plans to put on hold the earlier approvals of four of the eight plants
   to determine if they really are needed.

   Big utilities continue to push for all of the plants, maintaining that
   building natural gas plants doesn’t conflict with expanding solar
   power. They say both paths are necessary to ensure that California has
   reliable sources of power — wherever and whenever it is needed.

   The biggest industrial solar power plants, they note, produce
   electricity in the desert, in some cases hundreds of miles from
   population centers where most power is used.

   At times of peak demand, transmission lines can get congested, like Los
   Angeles highways. That’s why CAISO, utilities and regulators argue that
   new natural gas plants are needed closer to big cities. In addition,
   they say, the state needs ample electricity sources when the sun isn’t
   shining and the wind isn’t blowing enough.

   Utility critics agree that some redundancy is needed to guarantee
   reliability, but they contend that the state already has more than
   enough.

   California has so much surplus electricity that existing power plants
   run, on average, at slightly less than one-third of capacity. And some
   plants are being closed decades earlier than planned.

   As for congestion, critics note that the state already is crisscrossed
   with an extensive network of transmission lines. Building more plants
   and transmission lines wouldn’t make the power system much more
   reliable, but would mean higher profits for utilities, critics say.

   That is what the debate is about, said Jaleh Firooz, a power industry
   consultant who previously worked as an engineer for San Diego Gas &
   Electric for 24 years and helped in the formation of CAISO.

   “They have the lopsided incentive of building more,” she said.
   [1200] Jaleh Firooz, who worked 24 years as an engineer for San Diego
   Gas & Electric Co., says utilities seeking higher profits “have the
   lopsided incentive of building more” power plants and transmission
   lines. (Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times)

   The reason: Once state regulators approve new plants or transmission
   lines, the cost is now built into the amount that the utility can
   charge electricity users — no matter how much or how little it is used.

   Given that technology is rapidly tilting the competitive advantage
   toward solar power, there are less expensive and cleaner ways to make
   the transition toward renewable energy, she said.

   To buttress her argument, Firooz pointed to a battle in recent years
   over a natural gas plant in Redondo Beach.

   Independent power producer AES Southland in 2012 proposed replacing an
   aging facility there with a new one. The estimated cost: $250 million
   to $275 million, an amount that customers would pay off with higher
   electricity bills.

   CAISO and Southern California Edison, which was going to buy power from
   the new plant, supported it as necessary to protect against potential
   power interruptions. Though solar and wind power production was
   increasing, they said those sources couldn’t be counted on because
   their production is variable, not constant.

   The California Public Utilities Commission approved the project,
   agreeing that it was needed to meet the long-term electricity needs in
   the L.A. area.

   But the California Coastal Conservancy, a conservation group opposed to
   the plant, commissioned an analysis by Firooz to determine how vital it
   was. Her conclusion: not at all.

   Firooz calculated that the L.A. region already had excess power
   production capacity — even without the new plant — at least through
   2020.

   Along with the cushion, her report found, a combination of improved
   energy efficiency, local solar production, storage and other planning
   strategies would be more than sufficient to handle the area’s power
   needs even as the population grew.

   She questioned utility arguments.

   “In their assumptions, the amount of capacity they give to the solar is
   way, way undercut because they have to say, ‘What if it’s cloudy? What
   if the wind is not blowing?’ ” Firooz explained. “That’s how the game
   is played. You build these scenarios so that it basically justifies
   what you want.”

   In their assumptions, the amount of capacity they give to the solar is
   way, way undercut because they have to say, ‘What if it’s cloudy?’

   — Jaleh Firooz, power-industry consultant

   Undeterred, AES Southland pressed forward with its proposal. In 2013,
   Firooz updated her analysis at the request of the city of Redondo
   Beach, which was skeptical that a new plant was needed. Her findings
   remained the same.

   Nonetheless, the state Public Utilities Commission approved the project
   in March 2014 on the grounds that it was needed. But the California
   Energy Commission, another regulatory agency whose approval for new
   plants is required along with the PUC’s, sided with the critics. In
   November 2015 it suspended the project, effectively killing it.

   Asked about the plant, AES said it followed the appropriate processes
   in seeking approval. It declined to say whether it still thinks that a
   new plant is needed.

   The existing facility is expected to close in 2020.

   A March 2017 state report showed why critics are confident that the
   area will be fine without a new plant: The need for power from Redondo
   Beach’s existing four natural gas units has been so low, the state
   found, that the units have operated at less than 5% of their capacity
   during the last four years.

   Netflix has fired back in the battle for popular network sitcoms by
   landing the global streaming rights to “Seinfeld.”

   As part of a deal with Sony Pictures Television, which controls
   distribution of the iconic TV show, Netflix will offer all 180 episodes
   of “Seinfeld” in the U.S. and to its 151 million subscribers throughout
   the world when the five-year pact takes effect in 2021, the companies
   announced Monday.

   “‘Seinfeld’ is a one-of-a-kind, iconic, culture-defining show,” Sony
   Pictures Television Chairman Mike Hopkins said in a statement to The
   Times. “Now, 30 years after its premiere, ‘Seinfeld’ remains center
   stage. We’re thrilled to be partnering with Netflix to bring this
   beloved series to current fans and new audiences around the globe.”

   Landing “Seinfeld” is a major comeback statement for Netflix, which
   recently lost the streaming rights to “The Office” and “Friends” to the
   media conglomerates that own those shows. “The Office” will be part of
   NBCUniversal’s new streaming service, while “Friends” will be offered
   on WarnerMedia’s upcoming HBO Max platform.

   Terms of the transaction were not disclosed, but Netflix paid far more
   than the $500 million NBCUniversal paid for “The Office,” and the $425
   million WarnerMedia shelled out for “Friends,” people familiar with the
   deal said. Both of those five-year deals were for streaming rights in
   the U.S. only.

   Hulu, which is majority owned by Walt Disney Co., has the current
   domestic streaming rights to “Seinfeld,” paying about $130 million in a
   six-year deal that expires in 2021. Amazon had the streaming rights in
   most of the foreign territories that will be picked up by Netfilx.

   For the next five-year licensing period, Netflix topped bids from Hulu,
   Amazon, WarnerMedia, NBCUniversal and Viacom, which controls the CBS
   All Access streaming service since its merger with CBS Corp., according
   to people familiar with the discussions who were not authorized to
   comment.

   “Seinfeld is the television comedy that all television comedy is
   measured against,” Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, said
   in a statement. “It is as fresh and funny as ever and will be available
   to the world in 4K for the first time.”

   The move was a blow to NBCUniversal, which had a long association with
   “Seinfeld” and could have used the show to help lure viewers to its
   upcoming streaming service.

   But Netflix is said to have been particularly aggressive in pursuing
   “Seinfeld,” which is one of a handful of durable, long-running comedy
   series that appeal to several generations of viewers. “Seinfeld,” which
   stars comedian Jerry Seinfeld as himself going through single life in
   Manhattan with his solipsistic pals, ran from 1989 to 1998 on NBC and
   ended its original run while still ranking as the No. 1 show in prime
   time, according to Nielsen.

   The other broad-appeal sitcoms available on the streaming market —
   Warner Bros. Televison’s “The Big Bang Theory” and “Two and a Half Men”
   — are both expected to go to parent company WarnerMedia’s HBO Max. Some
   TV producers believe it has become futile for Netflix to bid against
   companies that are pursuing the rights for their own shows and
   essentially paying themselves.

   The ownership of “Seinfeld,” produced by the defunct studio Castle
   Rock, is spread among several entities, including WarnerMedia, CBS,
   Seinfeld and his co-creator, Larry David. All will share in the revenue
   from the Netflix deal after Sony receives a significant percentage as
   the show’s distributor.

   A new deal structure could have a significant impact on the long-term
   earnings of show creators.

   Even 20 years after “Seinfeld” left NBC, the show’s repeats remain a
   popular attraction on local TV stations and cable network TBS, and have
   generated billions of dollars in revenue worldwide.

   Netflix is already the streaming home for Seinfeld’s current series,
   “Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,” and his stand-up comedy specials.
   The relationship was not a determining factor in “Seinfeld” going to
   the service, sources said.

   In its recent earnings call for investors, Netflix executives
   downplayed the significance of losing “Friends” and “The Office.” The
   Los Gatos-based company has said it would have to eventually wean
   itself from outside program suppliers — a major reason why it invested
   $12 billion on content in 2018 and is investing $15 billion this year.

   The “Seinfeld” deal should not be seen as a departure from that
   strategy, according to an executive familiar with the matter. But the
   company will continue to license shows from outside suppliers when it’s
   seen as making sense for its business.

   It’s a chilly night on the rooftop of a New York City strip club when
   four words entice Constance Wu’s newbie dancer Destiny into the
   maternal, couture-lined fold of Jennifer Lopez’s glamorous Ramona in
   “Hustlers”: “Climb in my fur.”

   Alas, Destiny’s hunger for cash and connection has a cost in the
   true-crime female-empowerment movie of the season, opening Sept. 13
   following a world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival
   the weekend prior, in which a stilettoed sisterhood of ex-strippers
   scheme to steal from their Wall Street clients after the 2008 financial
   crisis. (The real-life tabloid-ready tale ended in arrests, as
   documented in the 2015 New York Magazine article on which “Hustlers” is
   based.)
   For the record:
   9:53 AM, Aug. 30, 2019 In an earlier version of this article, actress
   Lili Reinhart’s last name was misspelled as Reinhardt.

   To fans who know Wu best from television, playing an exotic
   dancer-turned-criminal might seem like quite a detour from Jessica
   Huang, the suburban sitcom mom she’s played for five seasons and
   counting on ABC’s “Fresh Off the Boat.” It’s only her second lead film
   role after portraying plucky rom-com heroine Rachel Chu in last
   summer’s “Crazy Rich Asians,” the Golden Globe-nominated hit that sent
   Wu’s Hollywood star skyrocketing.

   But Wu, 37, wanted the role so strongly she put herself on tape for
   writer-director Lorene Scafaria, to the mild bewilderment of her own
   agents.

   “I was looking for a movie with a character that was deeply lonely,”
   she said on a recent afternoon in the Times office, relaxing in a
   sundress and denim jacket, a cap pulled over her hair. She had noticed,
   and perhaps even felt herself, an overriding sense of isolation
   swirling in the zeitgeist.

   “I feel like loneliness right now is pervasive because of social
   media,” she said. “Some people aren’t connecting as much, or they don’t
   know how to do it in real life.”

   There was something else she was looking for too. After zooming into
   the spotlight as a rising Hollywood star and the anchor of two
   groundbreaking Asian American hit projects, she was on the hunt for
   roles that were multidimensional, human, complex.

   “In every project I choose, I want a character that gets to run the
   gamut of a full spectrum of an arc,” said Wu, whose “Hustlers”
   character, like the women around her, contains multitudes: The daughter
   of immigrants and a single mother herself, she’s a ladyboss in the
   making — until she’s left holding the designer bag. “Destiny has
   moments where she’s really funny, and moments when she’s really sad.
   Moments where she’s irresponsible, moments where she’s the only one who
   is responsible. That complexity is what I seek in any role, and this
   script really afforded her that journey.”

   Scafaria (“Seeking a Friend for the End of the World,” “The Meddler”)
   wrote the screenplay, imagining Lopez as the perfect Ramona, the
   ringleader set on turning the tables on the sleazy suits who
   underestimate women like her. Signing Lopez was the first piece of the
   casting puzzle for “Hustlers,” which STX acquired for production after
   a struggling Annapurna put the film in turnaround. (Annapurna head
   Megan Ellison remains an executive producer on the film.)

   The search for Destiny led to Wu, and then to the stacked ensemble,
   which includes Keke Palmer, Lili Reinhart, Julia Stiles, Mercedes
   Ruehl, Madeline Brewer, Trace Lysette, Lizzo (and her flute) and Cardi
   B.

   “Constance connected with this and wanted a shot at doing something
   that is obviously so different from anything we’ve ever seen her do,”
   said producer Jessica Elbaum, who optioned Jessica Pressler’s original
   article for Gloria Sanchez Productions.

   As soon as they met, Scafaria and Wu clicked. “I saw that she has a
   fragility and a vulnerability and a sensitivity and a very deep core,”
   said the writer-director. “She’s obviously a very gifted comedic
   actress, and she brought me to tears in ‘Crazy Rich Asians,’ so she is
   an incredible dramatic actress too. But I think she has weight and
   chops. And when I met her, I felt that.

   “I couldn’t be more proud of her,” Scafaria said of the actress. “She
   put herself out there; she tweezed those eyebrows up to 2007!”

   Filming began in New York this spring before STX, which has recently
   endured a series of flops including “UglyDolls” and “Poms,”
   fast-tracked “Hustlers” for a fall release. (Early tracking suggests
   the film could debut to the studio’s highest opening weekend gross
   ever.)
   “Hustlers” follows a crew of savvy former strip club employees who band
   together to turn the tables on their Wall Street clients. It stars
   Constance Wu, Jennifer Lopez, Lizzo, Cardi B. and more.

   To prepare for the role, Wu studied hours of interview tapes of
   Destiny’s real-life inspiration, former dancer Roselyn Keo, playing
   them on a loop in her trailer for reference. “When a culture at large
   judges you, in a way, there is camaraderie amongst each other because
   we know who we are even though they don’t,” Wu said of meeting
   real-life strippers for research.

   “Hustlers” aims to do justice to the unseen dimensions of these women’s
   lives. “That’s why we make movies like this. These women are trying
   their best in a world that has not always been fair to them. That’s the
   hustle: trying to get that dream when you started out 10 steps behind
   everybody else.”

   She impressed costar and producer Lopez during a scene in which their
   characters, who become both business partners and close friends, begin
   to disagree on the limits of their increasingly volatile scam
   operation.

   “There is a scene in the movie that we filmed early on where Destiny
   and Ramona get into a fight, and Constance really went for it,” said
   Lopez in an email. “And I was like, ‘Wow! OK. She is a gangster. We are
   going to do this movie.’ I think their story lines are fascinating
   because they start very similarly — same desires, same goals. But as
   they come more into their power and into more ‘success,’ their stories
   and thus their friendship really starts to diverge.”

   “This whole country is a strip club. You’ve got people throwing the
   money and you’ve got people doing the dance.”
   (STX Films)

   Wu could have taken easier roads after her “Crazy Rich Asians” success.
   The Richmond, Va., native had chased the classic actor hustle for
   years, working in theater, on TV and in indie films before scoring
   breakout status on “Fresh Off the Boat” opposite Randall Park and
   Hudson Yang.

   Premiering in 2015, it was the first Asian American-led sitcom to hit
   prime-time in 20 years. By 2017, Wu had been named one of Time’s Most
   Influential People, buoyed by her vocal activism online and in the
   Time’s Up movement. The same year, she was cast in “Crazy Rich Asians,”
   which also made history as the first Asian American-centered studio
   film in a quarter century. In the wake of “Crazy Rich Asians,” Wu is
   now able to get projects green-lighted, such as the upcoming novel
   adaptation “Goodbye, Vitamin,” in which she’ll star and executive
   produce.

   But with great power and over 1 million followers on social media comes
   great accountability, a lesson Wu admits she was still learning earlier
   this year when she posted negative reactions on Twitter and Instagram
   to the news that “Fresh Off the Boat” had been renewed for a sixth
   season.

   The blowback was immediate. Wu quickly apologized and provided context,
   saying she was upset that she’d have to forgo another project. “My
   words and ill-timing were insensitive to those who are struggling,
   especially insensitive considering the fact that I used to be in that
   struggle too. I do regret that and it wasn’t nice and I am sorry for
   that,” she wrote in a lengthy Instagram post.

   Fall Movie Sneaks 2019: ‘Joker,’ ‘Hustlers,’ ‘Maleficent’ and more are

   Character studies like “Joker,” sequels like “It Chapter Two” and
   “Terminator: Dark Fate” and the return of “Downton Abbey” are just a
   few of the films slated to be released this fall that we explore in our
   Fall Movie Sneaks.

   Though she didn’t go into detail at the time, it wasn’t another film
   but a play she’d been hoping to do — one in which she would have played
   a “not Asian-specific” role and likely worked for scale — that Wu had
   to give up to return to her show, for which she is under contract for
   another two years.

   “I had this moment of heat where I got upset because I had to give up a
   job I had been looking forward to and had been chasing for a while,”
   she said of her self-described “Twitter fiasco.” “It was moving to me
   how many people from the show reached out to me, and even on set ... to
   say, ‘Just so you know, we love you and we know who you are, and you
   didn’t deserve any of that stuff.’ Because they also know that I’m an
   actress — I can be dramatic.”

   Actors admitting they’re dramatic? A rarity! She laughed. “I mean,
   that’s our toolkit, right? I’m dramatic. I’m emotional. But they also
   know that that doesn’t represent me because they have a hundred
   episodes of behavior that proves otherwise.”
   Constance Wu
   “I don’t want to be in one box. There’s a part of me that’s like
   Jessica Huang, that’s why I can play her. There’s a part of me that’s
   like Destiny, that’s why I can play her.”

   She also learned a lesson from the backlash: Her platform affords her a
   greater reach than she realized. “I’m not beating myself up for it,
   because I know me,” said Wu. “But I don’t think I realized that people
   were paying so much attention to my Twitter.”

   At the time, she wasn’t sure the show would get renewed for a sixth
   season. Now, a part of her worries she’ll be blamed if Season 6 is its
   last. Still, Wu says, she regrets that her tweets affected others,
   including castmates, colleagues and ABC president Karey Burke.

   “I like that people are expressing their feelings about it, because it
   improved my awareness of what it means to be a ... public figure,” She
   paused, turning over the phrase. “I’ve had a back-and-forth about it.
   It’s the line between being a role model but also authenticity.”

   “I think a lot of why people are lonely in this world is because they
   go through these Instagram feeds and everybody’s life is perfect,” she
   said. “Nobody trips up. And sometimes I think, might it be good to see
   our heroes mess up a little bit and not always be perfect?”

   Imperfection is a quality seldom afforded those who carry the added
   mantle of representation. If Wu’s Asian American fans were particularly
   disappointed by her tweets, it may be because they were rooting for her
   to succeed, an emblem to champion in a Hollywood that’s still so slow
   to change. Can the public allow Wu to be fallible and human, still
   speak her mind, and learn as she goes?

   “There is an expectation of the way that I ought to behave, and not
   just of perfection but of graciousness. And I am grateful. But am I
   elegant?” she said with a laugh. “No. I think I can be verbally
   eloquent sometimes, but as a human, am I an elegant person? No.”

     Me getting to play a fully human experience as an Asian American,
     that shouldn’t be historic. But it is.

   Constance Wu

   As a wise oracle once sang, “A diva is a female version of a hustler.”
   Yet Wu, who just filled out her summer by paying her own way to Hawaii
   to act in an indie film for an emerging Asian American director, found
   herself at the center of headlines during the “Hustlers” promo tour
   describing her as a “diva.”

   Wu considered the label. “A woman owning her power rather than being
   like, ‘Who, me?,’ I think, is a threat to the patriarchy,” said Wu. “I
   know some people were like, ‘Constance demanded top billing.’ No, the
   script had me as the lead. But it’s a juicier story to say the other
   stuff.

   “I am grateful for my entire career,” she said. “But the fact that my
   career has been historic shouldn’t necessarily be a call [to say to]
   me, ‘You should be so lucky’ — it should be a call to pay attention to
   the fact that this kind of thing shouldn’t have been historic. Me
   getting to play a fully human experience as an Asian American, that
   shouldn’t be historic. But it is. Let’s talk about the system, not
   whether or not I deserve to be in it and how I need to feel about it.”

   Wu reiterated that her platform, even if it comes with public scrutiny,
   is not something she takes for granted.

   “I do think when you have a platform, you ought to make sure you use it
   as well and responsibly as you can,” said Wu, who returns to TV with
   the season premiere of “Fresh Off the Boat” on Sept. 27.

   “But,” she continued, flashing a wry smile, “I want to be careful not
   to blow up my profile any more. If it happens as a natural extension of
   me doing the thing that I think I am meant to do, which is to be an
   actor, then I welcome it and I’m grateful for it. That’s not the part
   of myself I’m seeking to put energy into ... but it teaches me.”

Xxxtentacion’s estate teases new song, ‘Royalty,’ one year after his death

   The estate of the late rapper Xxxtentacion is expected to release a new
   track by the artist on Friday, called “Royalty,” feeding a demand that
   shows no signs of slowing down a year after his death. A snippet of the
   song has been floating around the internet since April, and an
   Instagram account reportedly linked to the estate teased the release on
   Tuesday. The track will be included on a deluxe reissue of
   Xxxtentacion’s album "?,” which will come out July 26.

   Issued by Capitol Records, the forthcoming release will be the first
   major project since Xxx was murdered on June 18, 2018, during an
   ambush-robbery in South Florida. He was 20. A two-CD edition will
   feature the original album and its instrumentals, along with Xxx’s
   Christmas EP; a “bonus” disc includes “Royalty,” other new material,
   some remixes and voices memos. A booklet will include never-before-seen
   photos. There will also be an $80 triple LP version.

   The release will likely face comparisons with another posthumous
   record, by fellow Soundcloud rap star Lil Peep (who was born Gustav
   Åhr). A few days ago on the artist’s official Instagram account, Peep’s
   mother asked, “Who wants a new album with amazing unreleased Lil Peep
   music put together by Gus’ mom and the songs’ original collaborators?
   You have been asking for this, and I can’t wait to get it to you!” That
   will be Peep’s second post-death release.

   Xxxtentacion’s estate has so far only issued a few extant tracks, but
   his presence is all over the charts. Hitmaker JuiceWRLD just dropped a
   new track called “Run” that samples an unreleased Xxx track; the
   original version of "?” just jumped back into the top 50 of Billboard’s
   Top 200 album chart after hitting No. 1; it’s been on the chart for 69
   weeks. Xxxtentacion’s album “17" just cracked the top 100 on that same
   chart, part of a 98-week run that peaked at No. 2.

California invested heavily in solar power. Now there's so much that other
states are sometimes paid to take it

   By Ivan Penn

   June 22, 2017
   [energy_split_illo_color.gif]

   On 14 days during March, Arizona utilities got a gift from California:
   free solar power.

   Well, actually better than free. California produced so much solar
   power on those days that it paid Arizona to take excess electricity its
   residents weren’t using to avoid overloading its own power lines.

   ADVERTISEMENT

   It happened on eight days in January and nine in February as well. All
   told, those transactions helped save Arizona electricity customers
   millions of dollars this year, though grid operators declined to say
   exactly how much. And California also has paid other states to take
   power.

   The number of days that California dumped its unused solar electricity
   would have been even higher if the state hadn’t ordered some solar
   plants to reduce production — even as natural gas power plants, which
   contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, continued generating
   electricity.

   Solar and wind power production was curtailed a relatively small amount
   — about 3% in the first quarter of 2017 — but that’s more than double
   the same period last year. And the surge in solar power could push the
   number even higher in the future.

   Why doesn’t California, a champion of renewable energy, use all the
   solar power it can generate?

   The answer, in part, is that the state has achieved dramatic success in
   increasing renewable energy production in recent years. But it also
   reflects sharp conflicts among major energy players in the state over
   the best way to weave these new electricity sources into a system still
   dominated by fossil-fuel-generated power.
   [5x4] In Western Kern County, solar panels on almost two square miles
   of land form the Beacon Solar Project, owned by the Los Angeles
   Department of Water and Power. (Mel Melcon/Los Angels Times) [5x4] City
   officials and builders in Redondo Beach want a mixed-use development to
   replace the current natural gas facility. They say there is no need to
   overhaul the power plant when there is an abundance of clean
   alternatives. (Rick Loomis/Los Angeles Times)

   No single entity is in charge of energy policy in California. This has
   led to a two-track approach that has created an ever-increasing glut of
   power and is proving costly for electricity users. Rates have risen
   faster here than in the rest of the U.S., and Californians now pay
   about 50% more than the national average.

   Perhaps the most glaring example: The California Legislature has
   mandated that one-half of the state’s electricity come from renewable
   sources by 2030; today it’s about one-fourth. That goal once was
   considered wildly optimistic. But solar panels have become much more
   efficient and less expensive. So solar power is now often the same
   price or cheaper than most other types of electricity, and production
   has soared so much that the target now looks laughably easy to achieve.

   At the same time, however, state regulators — who act independently of
   the Legislature — until recently have continued to greenlight utility
   company proposals to build more natural gas power plants.
   [800] State Senate Leader Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles) wants
   Calilfornia to produce 100% of its electricity from clean energy
   sources such as solar and wind by 2045. (Luis Sinco/Los Angeles Times)

   These conflicting energy agendas have frustrated state Senate Leader
   Kevin de Leon (D-Los Angeles), who opposes more fossil fuel plants. He
   has introduced legislation that would require the state to meet its
   goal of 50% of its electricity from renewable sources five years
   earlier, by 2025. Even more ambitiously, he recently proposed
   legislation to require 100% of the state’s power to come from renewable
   energy sources by 2045.

   “I want to make sure we don’t have two different pathways,” de Leon
   said. Expanding clean energy production and also building natural gas
   plants, he added, is “a bad investment.”

   Environmental groups are even more critical. They contend that building
   more fossil fuel plants at the same time that solar production is being
   curtailed shows that utilities — with the support of regulators — are
   putting higher profits ahead of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

   “California and others have just been getting it wrong,” said Leia
   Guccione, an expert in renewable energy at the Rocky Mountain Institute
   in Colorado, a clean power advocate. “The way [utilities] earn revenue
   is building stuff. When they see a need, they are perversely
   [incentivized] to come up with a solution like a gas plant.”

   California and others have just been getting it wrong.

   — Leia Guccione, renewable energy expert at the Rocky Mountain
   Institute

   Regulators and utility officials dispute this view. They assert that
   the transition from fossil fuel power to renewable energy is
   complicated and that overlap is unavoidable.

   They note that electricity demand fluctuates — it is higher in summer
   in California, because of air conditioning, and lower in the winter —
   so some production capacity inevitably will be underused in the winter.
   Moreover, the solar power supply fluctuates as well. It peaks at
   midday, when the sunlight is strongest. Even then it isn’t totally
   reliable.

   Because no one can be sure when clouds might block sunshine during the
   day, fossil fuel electricity is needed to fill the gaps. Utility
   officials note that solar production is often cut back first because
   starting and stopping natural gas plants is costlier and more difficult
   than shutting down solar panels.

   electricity. (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times)

   Eventually, unnecessary redundancy of electricity from renewables and
   fossil fuel will disappear, regulators, utilities and operators of the
   electric grid say.

   “The gas-fired generation overall will show decline,” said Neil Millar,
   executive director of infrastructure at CAISO, the California
   Independent System Operator, which runs the electric grid and shares
   responsibility for preventing blackouts and brownouts. “Right now, as
   the new generation is coming online and the older generation hasn’t
   left yet, there is a bit of overlap.”

   Utility critics acknowledge these complexities. But they counter that
   utilities and regulators have been slow to grasp how rapidly technology
   is transforming the business. A building slowdown is long overdue, they
   argue.

   Despite a growing glut of power, however, authorities only recently
   agreed to put on hold proposals for some of the new natural gas power
   plants that utilities want to build to reconsider whether they are
   needed.

   A key question in the debate is when California will be able to rely on
   renewable power for most or all of its needs and safely phase out
   fossil fuel plants, which regulators are studying.

   The answer depends in large part on how fast battery storage improves,
   so it is cheaper and can store power closer to customers for use when
   the sun isn’t shining. Solar proponents say the technology is advancing
   rapidly, making reliance on renewables possible far sooner than
   previously predicted, perhaps two decades or even less from now — which
   means little need for new power plants with a life span of 30 to 40
   years.

   Calibrating this correctly is crucial to controlling electricity costs.

   “It’s not the renewables that’s the problem. It’s the state’s renewable
   policy that’s the problem,” said Gary Ackerman, president of the
   Western Power Trading Forum, an association of independent power
   producers. “We’re curtailing renewable energy in the summertime months.
   In the spring, we have to give people money to take it off our hands.”
     __________________________________________________________________

   Not long ago, solar was barely a rounding error for California’s energy
   producers.

   In 2010, power plants in the state generated just over 15% of their
   electricity production from renewable sources. But that was mostly wind
   and geothermal power, with only a scant 0.5% from solar. Now that
   overall amount has grown to 27%, with solar power accounting for 10%,
   or most of the increase. The solar figure doesn’t include the hundreds
   of thousands of rooftop solar systems that produce an additional 4
   percentage points, a share that is ever growing.

   Behind the rapid expansion of solar power: its plummeting price, which
   makes it highly competitive with other electricity sources. In part
   that stems from subsidies, but much of the decline comes from the sharp
   drop in the cost of making solar panels and their increased efficiency
   in converting sunlight into electricity.

   The average cost of solar power for residential, commercial and
   utility-scale projects declined 73% between 2010 and 2016. Solar
   electricity now costs 5 to 6 cents per kilowatt-hour — the amount
   needed to light a 100-watt bulb for 10 hours — to produce, or about the
   same as electricity produced by a natural gas plant and half the cost
   of a nuclear facility, according to the U.S. Energy Information
   Administration.

   Fly over the Carrizo Plain in California’s Central Valley near San Luis
   Obispo and you’ll see that what was once barren land is now a sprawling
   solar farm, with panels covering more than seven square miles — one of
   the world’s largest clean-energy projects. When the sun shines over the
   Topaz Solar Farm, the shimmering panels produce enough electricity to
   power all of the residential homes in a city the size of Long Beach,
   population 475,000.

   Other large-scale solar operations blanket swaths of the Mojave Desert,
   which has increasingly become a sun-soaking energy hub. The Beacon
   solar project covers nearly two square miles and the Ivanpah plant
   covers about five and a half square miles.

   The state’s three big shareholder-owned utilities now count themselves
   among the biggest solar power producers. Southern California Edison
   produces or buys more than 7% of its electricity from solar generators,
   Pacific Gas & Electric 13% and San Diego Gas & Electric 22%.

   Similarly, fly over any sizable city and you’ll see warehouses,
   businesses and parking lots with rooftop solar installations, and many
   homes as well.

   With a glut of solar power at times, CAISO has two main options to
   avoid a system overload: order some solar and wind farms to temporarily
   halt operations or divert the excess power to other states.

   That’s because too much electricity can overload the transmission
   system and result in power outages, just as too little can.
   Complicating matters is that even when CAISO requires large-scale solar
   plants to shut off panels, it can’t control solar rooftop installations
   that are churning out electricity.

   CAISO is being forced to juggle this surplus more and more.

   In 2015, solar and wind production were curtailed about 15% of the time
   on average during a 24-hour period. That rose to 21% in 2016 and 31% in
   the first few months of this year. The surge in solar production
   accounts for most of this, though heavy rainfall has increased
   hydroelectric power production in the state this year, adding to the
   surplus of renewables.

   the plug California’s clean energy supply is growing so fast that solar
   and wind producers are increasingly being ordered to halt production.

   Even when solar production is curtailed, the state can produce more
   than it uses, because it is difficult to calibrate supply and demand
   precisely. As more homeowners install rooftop solar, for example, their
   panels can send more electricity to the grid than anticipated on some
   days, while the state’s overall power usage might fall below what was
   expected.

   This means that CAISO increasingly has excess solar and wind power it
   can send to Arizona, Nevada and other states.

   When those states need more electricity than they are producing, they
   pay California for the power. But California has excess power on a
   growing number of days when neighboring states don’t need it, so
   California has to pay them to take it. CAISO calls that “negative
   pricing.”

   Why does California have to pay rather than simply give the power away
   free?

   When there isn’t demand for all the power the state is producing, CAISO
   needs to quickly sell the excess to avoid overloading the electricity
   grid, which can cause blackouts. Basic economics kick in. Oversupply
   causes prices to fall, even below zero. That’s because Arizona has to
   curtail its own sources of electricity to take California’s power when
   it doesn’t really need it, which can cost money. So Arizona will use
   power from California at times like this only if it has an economic
   incentive — which means being paid.

   In the first two months of this year, CAISO paid to send excess power
   to other states seven times more often than same period in 2014.
   “Negative pricing” happened in an average of 18% of all sales, versus
   about 2.5% in the same period in 2014.

   Most “negative pricing” typically has occurred for relatively short
   periods at midday, when solar production is highest.

   But what happened in March shows how the growing supply of solar power
   could have a much greater impact in the future. The periods of
   “negative pricing” lasted longer than in the past — often for six hours
   at a time, and once for eight hours, according to a CAISO report.

   The excess power problem will ease somewhat in the summer, when
   electricity usage is about 50% higher in California than in the winter.

   But CAISO concedes that curtailments and “negative pricing” is likely
   to happen even more often in the future as solar power production
   continues to grow, unless action is taken to better manage the excess
   electricity.

   NRG Energy and BrightSource Energy, occupies 5.5 square miles in the

   & Electric and Southern California Edison customers. (Mark Boster/Los
   Angeles Times)

   Arizona’s largest utility, Arizona Public Service, is one of the
   biggest beneficiaries of California’s largesse because it is next door
   and the power can easily be sent there on transmission lines.

   On days that Arizona is paid to take California’s excess solar power,
   Arizona Public Service says it has cut its own solar generation rather
   than fossil fuel power. So California’s excess solar isn’t reducing
   greenhouse gases when that happens.

   CAISO says it does not calculate how much it has paid others so far
   this year to take excess electricity. But its recent oversupply report
   indicated that it frequently paid buyers as much as $25 per
   megawatt-hour to get them to take excess power, according to the Energy
   Information Administration.

   That’s a good deal for Arizona, which uses what it is paid by
   California to reduce its own customers’ electricity bills. Utility
   buyers typically pay an average of $14 to $45 per megawatt-hour for
   electricity when there isn’t a surplus from high solar power
   production.
     __________________________________________________________________

   With solar power surging so much that it is sometimes curtailed, does
   California need to spend $6 billion to $8 billion to build or refurbish
   eight natural gas power plants that have received preliminary approval
   from regulators, especially as legislative leaders want to accelerate
   the move away from fossil fuel energy?

   The answer depends on whom you ask.

   ADVERTISEMENT

   Utilities have repeatedly said yes. State regulators have agreed until
   now, approving almost all proposals for new power plants. But this
   month, citing the growing electricity surplus, regulators announced
   plans to put on hold the earlier approvals of four of the eight plants
   to determine if they really are needed.

   Big utilities continue to push for all of the plants, maintaining that
   building natural gas plants doesn’t conflict with expanding solar
   power. They say both paths are necessary to ensure that California has
   reliable sources of power — wherever and whenever it is needed.

   The biggest industrial solar power plants, they note, produce
   electricity in the desert, in some cases hundreds of miles from
   population centers where most power is used.

   At times of peak demand, transmission lines can get congested, like Los
   Angeles highways. That’s why CAISO, utilities and regulators argue that
   new natural gas plants are needed closer to big cities. In addition,
   they say, the state needs ample electricity sources when the sun isn’t
   shining and the wind isn’t blowing enough.

   Utility critics agree that some redundancy is needed to guarantee
   reliability, but they contend that the state already has more than
   enough.

   California has so much surplus electricity that existing power plants
   run, on average, at slightly less than one-third of capacity. And some
   plants are being closed decades earlier than planned.

   As for congestion, critics note that the state already is crisscrossed
   with an extensive network of transmission lines. Building more plants
   and transmission lines wouldn’t make the power system much more
   reliable, but would mean higher profits for utilities, critics say.

   That is what the debate is about, said Jaleh Firooz, a power industry
   consultant who previously worked as an engineer for San Diego Gas &
   Electric for 24 years and helped in the formation of CAISO.

   “They have the lopsided incentive of building more,” she said.
   [1200] Jaleh Firooz, who worked 24 years as an engineer for San Diego
   Gas & Electric Co., says utilities seeking higher profits “have the
   lopsided incentive of building more” power plants and transmission
   lines. (Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times)

   The reason: Once state regulators approve new plants or transmission
   lines, the cost is now built into the amount that the utility can
   charge electricity users — no matter how much or how little it is used.

   Given that technology is rapidly tilting the competitive advantage
   toward solar power, there are less expensive and cleaner ways to make
   the transition toward renewable energy, she said.

   To buttress her argument, Firooz pointed to a battle in recent years
   over a natural gas plant in Redondo Beach.

   Independent power producer AES Southland in 2012 proposed replacing an
   aging facility there with a new one. The estimated cost: $250 million
   to $275 million, an amount that customers would pay off with higher
   electricity bills.

   CAISO and Southern California Edison, which was going to buy power from
   the new plant, supported it as necessary to protect against potential
   power interruptions. Though solar and wind power production was
   increasing, they said those sources couldn’t be counted on because
   their production is variable, not constant.

   The California Public Utilities Commission approved the project,
   agreeing that it was needed to meet the long-term electricity needs in
   the L.A. area.

   But the California Coastal Conservancy, a conservation group opposed to
   the plant, commissioned an analysis by Firooz to determine how vital it
   was. Her conclusion: not at all.

   Firooz calculated that the L.A. region already had excess power
   production capacity — even without the new plant — at least through
   2020.

   Along with the cushion, her report found, a combination of improved
   energy efficiency, local solar production, storage and other planning
   strategies would be more than sufficient to handle the area’s power
   needs even as the population grew.

   She questioned utility arguments.

   “In their assumptions, the amount of capacity they give to the solar is
   way, way undercut because they have to say, ‘What if it’s cloudy? What
   if the wind is not blowing?’ ” Firooz explained. “That’s how the game
   is played. You build these scenarios so that it basically justifies
   what you want.”

   In their assumptions, the amount of capacity they give to the solar is
   way, way undercut because they have to say, ‘What if it’s cloudy?’

   — Jaleh Firooz, power-industry consultant

   Undeterred, AES Southland pressed forward with its proposal. In 2013,
   Firooz updated her analysis at the request of the city of Redondo
   Beach, which was skeptical that a new plant was needed. Her findings
   remained the same.

   Nonetheless, the state Public Utilities Commission approved the project
   in March 2014 on the grounds that it was needed. But the California
   Energy Commission, another regulatory agency whose approval for new
   plants is required along with the PUC’s, sided with the critics. In
   November 2015 it suspended the project, effectively killing it.

   Asked about the plant, AES said it followed the appropriate processes
   in seeking approval. It declined to say whether it still thinks that a
   new plant is needed.

   The existing facility is expected to close in 2020.

   A March 2017 state report showed why critics are confident that the
   area will be fine without a new plant: The need for power from Redondo
   Beach’s existing four natural gas units has been so low, the state
   found, that the units have operated at less than 5% of their capacity
   during the last four years.

   Netflix has fired back in the battle for popular network sitcoms by
   landing the global streaming rights to “Seinfeld.”

   As part of a deal with Sony Pictures Television, which controls
   distribution of the iconic TV show, Netflix will offer all 180 episodes
   of “Seinfeld” in the U.S. and to its 151 million subscribers throughout
   the world when the five-year pact takes effect in 2021, the companies
   announced Monday.

   “‘Seinfeld’ is a one-of-a-kind, iconic, culture-defining show,” Sony
   Pictures Television Chairman Mike Hopkins said in a statement to The
   Times. “Now, 30 years after its premiere, ‘Seinfeld’ remains center
   stage. We’re thrilled to be partnering with Netflix to bring this
   beloved series to current fans and new audiences around the globe.”

   Landing “Seinfeld” is a major comeback statement for Netflix, which
   recently lost the streaming rights to “The Office” and “Friends” to the
   media conglomerates that own those shows. “The Office” will be part of
   NBCUniversal’s new streaming service, while “Friends” will be offered
   on WarnerMedia’s upcoming HBO Max platform.

   Terms of the transaction were not disclosed, but Netflix paid far more
   than the $500 million NBCUniversal paid for “The Office,” and the $425
   million WarnerMedia shelled out for “Friends,” people familiar with the
   deal said. Both of those five-year deals were for streaming rights in
   the U.S. only.

   Hulu, which is majority owned by Walt Disney Co., has the current
   domestic streaming rights to “Seinfeld,” paying about $130 million in a
   six-year deal that expires in 2021. Amazon had the streaming rights in
   most of the foreign territories that will be picked up by Netfilx.

   For the next five-year licensing period, Netflix topped bids from Hulu,
   Amazon, WarnerMedia, NBCUniversal and Viacom, which controls the CBS
   All Access streaming service since its merger with CBS Corp., according
   to people familiar with the discussions who were not authorized to
   comment.

   “Seinfeld is the television comedy that all television comedy is
   measured against,” Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, said
   in a statement. “It is as fresh and funny as ever and will be available
   to the world in 4K for the first time.”

   The move was a blow to NBCUniversal, which had a long association with
   “Seinfeld” and could have used the show to help lure viewers to its
   upcoming streaming service.

   But Netflix is said to have been particularly aggressive in pursuing
   “Seinfeld,” which is one of a handful of durable, long-running comedy
   series that appeal to several generations of viewers. “Seinfeld,” which
   stars comedian Jerry Seinfeld as himself going through single life in
   Manhattan with his solipsistic pals, ran from 1989 to 1998 on NBC and
   ended its original run while still ranking as the No. 1 show in prime
   time, according to Nielsen.

   The other broad-appeal sitcoms available on the streaming market —
   Warner Bros. Televison’s “The Big Bang Theory” and “Two and a Half Men”
   — are both expected to go to parent company WarnerMedia’s HBO Max. Some
   TV producers believe it has become futile for Netflix to bid against
   companies that are pursuing the rights for their own shows and
   essentially paying themselves.

   The ownership of “Seinfeld,” produced by the defunct studio Castle
   Rock, is spread among several entities, including WarnerMedia, CBS,
   Seinfeld and his co-creator, Larry David. All will share in the revenue
   from the Netflix deal after Sony receives a significant percentage as
   the show’s distributor.

   A new deal structure could have a significant impact on the long-term
   earnings of show creators.

   Even 20 years after “Seinfeld” left NBC, the show’s repeats remain a
   popular attraction on local TV stations and cable network TBS, and have
   generated billions of dollars in revenue worldwide.

   Netflix is already the streaming home for Seinfeld’s current series,
   “Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,” and his stand-up comedy specials.
   The relationship was not a determining factor in “Seinfeld” going to
   the service, sources said.

   In its recent earnings call for investors, Netflix executives
   downplayed the significance of losing “Friends” and “The Office.” The
   Los Gatos-based company has said it would have to eventually wean
   itself from outside program suppliers — a major reason why it invested
   $12 billion on content in 2018 and is investing $15 billion this year.

   The “Seinfeld” deal should not be seen as a departure from that
   strategy, according to an executive familiar with the matter. But the
   company will continue to license shows from outside suppliers when it’s
   seen as making sense for its business.

Constance Wu fought for ‘Hustlers.’ But the spotlight is the real challenge

   It’s a chilly night on the rooftop of a New York City strip club when
   four words entice Constance Wu’s newbie dancer Destiny into the
   maternal, couture-lined fold of Jennifer Lopez’s glamorous Ramona in
   “Hustlers”: “Climb in my fur.”

   Alas, Destiny’s hunger for cash and connection has a cost in the
   true-crime female-empowerment movie of the season, opening Sept. 13
   following a world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival
   the weekend prior, in which a stilettoed sisterhood of ex-strippers
   scheme to steal from their Wall Street clients after the 2008 financial
   crisis. (The real-life tabloid-ready tale ended in arrests, as
   documented in the 2015 New York Magazine article on which “Hustlers” is
   based.)
   For the record:
   9:53 AM, Aug. 30, 2019 In an earlier version of this article, actress
   Lili Reinhart’s last name was misspelled as Reinhardt.

   To fans who know Wu best from television, playing an exotic
   dancer-turned-criminal might seem like quite a detour from Jessica
   Huang, the suburban sitcom mom she’s played for five seasons and
   counting on ABC’s “Fresh Off the Boat.” It’s only her second lead film
   role after portraying plucky rom-com heroine Rachel Chu in last
   summer’s “Crazy Rich Asians,” the Golden Globe-nominated hit that sent
   Wu’s Hollywood star skyrocketing.

   But Wu, 37, wanted the role so strongly she put herself on tape for
   writer-director Lorene Scafaria, to the mild bewilderment of her own
   agents.

   “I was looking for a movie with a character that was deeply lonely,”
   she said on a recent afternoon in the Times office, relaxing in a
   sundress and denim jacket, a cap pulled over her hair. She had noticed,
   and perhaps even felt herself, an overriding sense of isolation
   swirling in the zeitgeist.

   “I feel like loneliness right now is pervasive because of social
   media,” she said. “Some people aren’t connecting as much, or they don’t
   know how to do it in real life.”

   There was something else she was looking for too. After zooming into
   the spotlight as a rising Hollywood star and the anchor of two
   groundbreaking Asian American hit projects, she was on the hunt for
   roles that were multidimensional, human, complex.

   “In every project I choose, I want a character that gets to run the
   gamut of a full spectrum of an arc,” said Wu, whose “Hustlers”
   character, like the women around her, contains multitudes: The daughter
   of immigrants and a single mother herself, she’s a ladyboss in the
   making — until she’s left holding the designer bag. “Destiny has
   moments where she’s really funny, and moments when she’s really sad.
   Moments where she’s irresponsible, moments where she’s the only one who
   is responsible. That complexity is what I seek in any role, and this
   script really afforded her that journey.”

   Scafaria (“Seeking a Friend for the End of the World,” “The Meddler”)
   wrote the screenplay, imagining Lopez as the perfect Ramona, the
   ringleader set on turning the tables on the sleazy suits who
   underestimate women like her. Signing Lopez was the first piece of the
   casting puzzle for “Hustlers,” which STX acquired for production after
   a struggling Annapurna put the film in turnaround. (Annapurna head
   Megan Ellison remains an executive producer on the film.)

   The search for Destiny led to Wu, and then to the stacked ensemble,
   which includes Keke Palmer, Lili Reinhart, Julia Stiles, Mercedes
   Ruehl, Madeline Brewer, Trace Lysette, Lizzo (and her flute) and Cardi
   B.

   “Constance connected with this and wanted a shot at doing something
   that is obviously so different from anything we’ve ever seen her do,”
   said producer Jessica Elbaum, who optioned Jessica Pressler’s original
   article for Gloria Sanchez Productions.

   As soon as they met, Scafaria and Wu clicked. “I saw that she has a
   fragility and a vulnerability and a sensitivity and a very deep core,”
   said the writer-director. “She’s obviously a very gifted comedic
   actress, and she brought me to tears in ‘Crazy Rich Asians,’ so she is
   an incredible dramatic actress too. But I think she has weight and
   chops. And when I met her, I felt that.

   “I couldn’t be more proud of her,” Scafaria said of the actress. “She
   put herself out there; she tweezed those eyebrows up to 2007!”

   Filming began in New York this spring before STX, which has recently
   endured a series of flops including “UglyDolls” and “Poms,”
   fast-tracked “Hustlers” for a fall release. (Early tracking suggests
   the film could debut to the studio’s highest opening weekend gross
   ever.)
   “Hustlers” follows a crew of savvy former strip club employees who band
   together to turn the tables on their Wall Street clients. It stars
   Constance Wu, Jennifer Lopez, Lizzo, Cardi B. and more.

   To prepare for the role, Wu studied hours of interview tapes of
   Destiny’s real-life inspiration, former dancer Roselyn Keo, playing
   them on a loop in her trailer for reference. “When a culture at large
   judges you, in a way, there is camaraderie amongst each other because
   we know who we are even though they don’t,” Wu said of meeting
   real-life strippers for research.

   “Hustlers” aims to do justice to the unseen dimensions of these women’s
   lives. “That’s why we make movies like this. These women are trying
   their best in a world that has not always been fair to them. That’s the
   hustle: trying to get that dream when you started out 10 steps behind
   everybody else.”

   She impressed costar and producer Lopez during a scene in which their
   characters, who become both business partners and close friends, begin
   to disagree on the limits of their increasingly volatile scam
   operation.

   “There is a scene in the movie that we filmed early on where Destiny
   and Ramona get into a fight, and Constance really went for it,” said
   Lopez in an email. “And I was like, ‘Wow! OK. She is a gangster. We are
   going to do this movie.’ I think their story lines are fascinating
   because they start very similarly — same desires, same goals. But as
   they come more into their power and into more ‘success,’ their stories
   and thus their friendship really starts to diverge.”

   “This whole country is a strip club. You’ve got people throwing the
   money and you’ve got people doing the dance.”
   (STX Films)

   Wu could have taken easier roads after her “Crazy Rich Asians” success.
   The Richmond, Va., native had chased the classic actor hustle for
   years, working in theater, on TV and in indie films before scoring
   breakout status on “Fresh Off the Boat” opposite Randall Park and
   Hudson Yang.

   Premiering in 2015, it was the first Asian American-led sitcom to hit
   prime-time in 20 years. By 2017, Wu had been named one of Time’s Most
   Influential People, buoyed by her vocal activism online and in the
   Time’s Up movement. The same year, she was cast in “Crazy Rich Asians,”
   which also made history as the first Asian American-centered studio
   film in a quarter century. In the wake of “Crazy Rich Asians,” Wu is
   now able to get projects green-lighted, such as the upcoming novel
   adaptation “Goodbye, Vitamin,” in which she’ll star and executive
   produce.

   But with great power and over 1 million followers on social media comes
   great accountability, a lesson Wu admits she was still learning earlier
   this year when she posted negative reactions on Twitter and Instagram
   to the news that “Fresh Off the Boat” had been renewed for a sixth
   season.

   The blowback was immediate. Wu quickly apologized and provided context,
   saying she was upset that she’d have to forgo another project. “My
   words and ill-timing were insensitive to those who are struggling,
   especially insensitive considering the fact that I used to be in that
   struggle too. I do regret that and it wasn’t nice and I am sorry for
   that,” she wrote in a lengthy Instagram post.

   Fall Movie Sneaks 2019: ‘Joker,’ ‘Hustlers,’ ‘Maleficent’ and more are
   set to hit theaters
   Character studies like “Joker,” sequels like “It Chapter Two” and
   “Terminator: Dark Fate” and the return of “Downton Abbey” are just a
   few of the films slated to be released this fall that we explore in our
   Fall Movie Sneaks.

   Though she didn’t go into detail at the time, it wasn’t another film
   but a play she’d been hoping to do — one in which she would have played
   a “not Asian-specific” role and likely worked for scale — that Wu had
   to give up to return to her show, for which she is under contract for
   another two years.

   “I had this moment of heat where I got upset because I had to give up a
   job I had been looking forward to and had been chasing for a while,”
   she said of her self-described “Twitter fiasco.” “It was moving to me
   how many people from the show reached out to me, and even on set ... to
   say, ‘Just so you know, we love you and we know who you are, and you
   didn’t deserve any of that stuff.’ Because they also know that I’m an
   actress — I can be dramatic.”

   Actors admitting they’re dramatic? A rarity! She laughed. “I mean,
   that’s our toolkit, right? I’m dramatic. I’m emotional. But they also
   know that that doesn’t represent me because they have a hundred
   episodes of behavior that proves otherwise.”
   Constance Wu
   “I don’t want to be in one box. There’s a part of me that’s like
   Jessica Huang, that’s why I can play her. There’s a part of me that’s
   like Destiny, that’s why I can play her.”
   (Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times)

   She also learned a lesson from the backlash: Her platform affords her a
   greater reach than she realized. “I’m not beating myself up for it,
   because I know me,” said Wu. “But I don’t think I realized that people
   were paying so much attention to my Twitter.”

   At the time, she wasn’t sure the show would get renewed for a sixth
   season. Now, a part of her worries she’ll be blamed if Season 6 is its
   last. Still, Wu says, she regrets that her tweets affected others,
   including castmates, colleagues and ABC president Karey Burke.

   “I like that people are expressing their feelings about it, because it
   improved my awareness of what it means to be a ... public figure,” She
   paused, turning over the phrase. “I’ve had a back-and-forth about it.
   It’s the line between being a role model but also authenticity.”

   “I think a lot of why people are lonely in this world is because they
   go through these Instagram feeds and everybody’s life is perfect,” she
   said. “Nobody trips up. And sometimes I think, might it be good to see
   our heroes mess up a little bit and not always be perfect?”

   Imperfection is a quality seldom afforded those who carry the added
   mantle of representation. If Wu’s Asian American fans were particularly
   disappointed by her tweets, it may be because they were rooting for her
   to succeed, an emblem to champion in a Hollywood that’s still so slow
   to change. Can the public allow Wu to be fallible and human, still
   speak her mind, and learn as she goes?

   “There is an expectation of the way that I ought to behave, and not
   just of perfection but of graciousness. And I am grateful. But am I
   elegant?” she said with a laugh. “No. I think I can be verbally
   eloquent sometimes, but as a human, am I an elegant person? No.”

     Me getting to play a fully human experience as an Asian American,
     that shouldn’t be historic. But it is.

   Constance Wu

   As a wise oracle once sang, “A diva is a female version of a hustler.”
   Yet Wu, who just filled out her summer by paying her own way to Hawaii
   to act in an indie film for an emerging Asian American director, found
   herself at the center of headlines during the “Hustlers” promo tour
   describing her as a “diva.”

   Wu considered the label. “A woman owning her power rather than being
   like, ‘Who, me?,’ I think, is a threat to the patriarchy,” said Wu. “I
   know some people were like, ‘Constance demanded top billing.’ No, the
   script had me as the lead. But it’s a juicier story to say the other
   stuff.

   “I am grateful for my entire career,” she said. “But the fact that my
   career has been historic shouldn’t necessarily be a call [to say to]
   me, ‘You should be so lucky’ — it should be a call to pay attention to
   the fact that this kind of thing shouldn’t have been historic. Me
   getting to play a fully human experience as an Asian American, that
   shouldn’t be historic. But it is. Let’s talk about the system, not
   whether or not I deserve to be in it and how I need to feel about it.”

   Wu reiterated that her platform, even if it comes with public scrutiny,
   is not something she takes for granted.

   “I do think when you have a platform, you ought to make sure you use it
   as well and responsibly as you can,” said Wu, who returns to TV with
   the season premiere of “Fresh Off the Boat” on Sept. 27.

   “But,” she continued, flashing a wry smile, “I want to be careful not
   to blow up my profile any more. If it happens as a natural extension of

   of myself I’m seeking to put energy into ... but it teaches me.”

Xxxtentacion’s estate teases new song, ‘Royalty,’ one year after his death

   Xxxtentacion visits a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., radio station in 2017.
   (MPI04 / MediaPunch )
   By Randall Roberts Staff Writer

     * LinkedIn
     * Email

   The estate of the late rapper Xxxtentacion is expected to release a new
   track by the artist on Friday, called “Royalty,” feeding a demand that
   shows no signs of slowing down a year after his death. A snippet of the
   song has been floating around the internet since April, and an
   Instagram account reportedly linked to the estate teased the release on
   Tuesday. The track will be included on a deluxe reissue of
   Xxxtentacion’s album "?,” which will come out July 26.

   Issued by Capitol Records, the forthcoming release will be the first
   major project since Xxx was murdered on June 18, 2018, during an
   ambush-robbery in South Florida. He was 20. A two-CD edition will
   feature the original album and its instrumentals, along with Xxx’s
   Christmas EP; a “bonus” disc includes “Royalty,” other new material,
   some remixes and voices memos. A booklet will include never-before-seen
   photos. There will also be an $80 triple LP version.

   The release will likely face comparisons with another posthumous
   record, by fellow Soundcloud rap star Lil Peep (who was born Gustav
   Åhr). A few days ago on the artist’s official Instagram account, Peep’s
   mother asked, “Who wants a new album with amazing unreleased Lil Peep
   music put together by Gus’ mom and the songs’ original collaborators?
   You have been asking for this, and I can’t wait to get it to you!” That
   will be Peep’s second post-death release.

   Xxxtentacion’s estate has so far only issued a few extant tracks, but
   his presence is all over the charts. Hitmaker JuiceWRLD just dropped a
   new track called “Run” that samples an unreleased Xxx track; the
   original version of "?” just jumped back into the top 50 of Billboard’s
   Top 200 album chart after hitting No. 1; it’s been on the chart for 69
   weeks. Xxxtentacion’s album “17" just cracked the top 100 on that same
   chart, part of a 98-week run that peaked at No. 2.

Netflix acquires the global streaming rights to ‘Seinfeld’

   Netflix has fired back in the battle for popular network sitcoms by
   landing the global streaming rights to “Seinfeld.”

   As part of a deal with Sony Pictures Television, which controls
   distribution of the iconic TV show, Netflix will offer all 180 episodes
   of “Seinfeld” in the U.S. and to its 151 million subscribers throughout
   the world when the five-year pact takes effect in 2021, the companies
   announced Monday.

   “‘Seinfeld’ is a one-of-a-kind, iconic, culture-defining show,” Sony
   Pictures Television Chairman Mike Hopkins said in a statement to The
   Times. “Now, 30 years after its premiere, ‘Seinfeld’ remains center
   stage. We’re thrilled to be partnering with Netflix to bring this
   beloved series to current fans and new audiences around the globe.”

   Landing “Seinfeld” is a major comeback statement for Netflix, which
   recently lost the streaming rights to “The Office” and “Friends” to the
   media conglomerates that own those shows. “The Office” will be part of
   NBCUniversal’s new streaming service, while “Friends” will be offered
   on WarnerMedia’s upcoming HBO Max platform.

   Terms of the transaction were not disclosed, but Netflix paid far more
   than the $500 million NBCUniversal paid for “The Office,” and the $425
   million WarnerMedia shelled out for “Friends,” people familiar with the
   deal said. Both of those five-year deals were for streaming rights in
   the U.S. only.

   Hulu, which is majority owned by Walt Disney Co., has the current
   domestic streaming rights to “Seinfeld,” paying about $130 million in a
   six-year deal that expires in 2021. Amazon had the streaming rights in
   most of the foreign territories that will be picked up by Netfilx.

   and maybe Hulu

   For the next five-year licensing period, Netflix topped bids from Hulu,
   Amazon, WarnerMedia, NBCUniversal and Viacom, which controls the CBS
   All Access streaming service since its merger with CBS Corp., according
   to people familiar with the discussions who were not authorized to
   comment.

   “Seinfeld is the television comedy that all television comedy is
   measured against,” Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, said
   in a statement. “It is as fresh and funny as ever and will be available
   to the world in 4K for the first time.”

   The move was a blow to NBCUniversal, which had a long association with
   “Seinfeld” and could have used the show to help lure viewers to its
   upcoming streaming service.

   But Netflix is said to have been particularly aggressive in pursuing
   “Seinfeld,” which is one of a handful of durable, long-running comedy
   series that appeal to several generations of viewers. “Seinfeld,” which
   stars comedian Jerry Seinfeld as himself going through single life in
   Manhattan with his solipsistic pals, ran from 1989 to 1998 on NBC and
   ended its original run while still ranking as the No. 1 show in prime
   time, according to Nielsen.

   The other broad-appeal sitcoms available on the streaming market —
   Warner Bros. Televison’s “The Big Bang Theory” and “Two and a Half Men”
   — are both expected to go to parent company WarnerMedia’s HBO Max. Some
   TV producers believe it has become futile for Netflix to bid against
   companies that are pursuing the rights for their own shows and
   essentially paying themselves.

   The ownership of “Seinfeld,” produced by the defunct studio Castle
   Rock, is spread among several entities, including WarnerMedia, CBS,
   Seinfeld and his co-creator, Larry David. All will share in the revenue
   from the Netflix deal after Sony receives a significant percentage as
   the show’s distributor.

   Even 20 years after “Seinfeld” left NBC, the show’s repeats remain a
   popular attraction on local TV stations and cable network TBS, and have
   generated billions of dollars in revenue worldwide.

   Netflix is already the streaming home for Seinfeld’s current series,
   “Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,” and his stand-up comedy specials.
   The relationship was not a determining factor in “Seinfeld” going to
   the service, sources said.

   In its recent earnings call for investors, Netflix executives
   downplayed the significance of losing “Friends” and “The Office.” The
   Los Gatos-based company has said it would have to eventually wean
   itself from outside program suppliers — a major reason why it invested
   $12 billion on content in 2018 and is investing $15 billion this year.

   The “Seinfeld” deal should not be seen as a departure from that
   strategy, according to an executive familiar with the matter. But the
   company will continue to license shows from outside suppliers when it’s
   seen as making sense for its business.

Constance Wu fought for ‘Hustlers.’ But the spotlight is the real challenge

   (Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times)

   It’s a chilly night on the rooftop of a New York City strip club when
   four words entice Constance Wu’s newbie dancer Destiny into the
   maternal, couture-lined fold of Jennifer Lopez’s glamorous Ramona in
   “Hustlers”: “Climb in my fur.”

   Alas, Destiny’s hunger for cash and connection has a cost in the
   true-crime female-empowerment movie of the season, opening Sept. 13
   following a world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival
   the weekend prior, in which a stilettoed sisterhood of ex-strippers
   scheme to steal from their Wall Street clients after the 2008 financial
   crisis. (The real-life tabloid-ready tale ended in arrests, as
   documented in the 2015 New York Magazine article on which “Hustlers” is
   based.)
   For the record:
   9:53 AM, Aug. 30, 2019 In an earlier version of this article, actress
   Lili Reinhart’s last name was misspelled as Reinhardt.

   To fans who know Wu best from television, playing an exotic
   dancer-turned-criminal might seem like quite a detour from Jessica
   Huang, the suburban sitcom mom she’s played for five seasons and
   counting on ABC’s “Fresh Off the Boat.” It’s only her second lead film
   role after portraying plucky rom-com heroine Rachel Chu in last
   summer’s “Crazy Rich Asians,” the Golden Globe-nominated hit that sent
   Wu’s Hollywood star skyrocketing.

   But Wu, 37, wanted the role so strongly she put herself on tape for
   writer-director Lorene Scafaria, to the mild bewilderment of her own
   agents.

   “I was looking for a movie with a character that was deeply lonely,”
   she said on a recent afternoon in the Times office, relaxing in a
   sundress and denim jacket, a cap pulled over her hair. She had noticed,
   and perhaps even felt herself, an overriding sense of isolation
   swirling in the zeitgeist.

   “I feel like loneliness right now is pervasive because of social
   media,” she said. “Some people aren’t connecting as much, or they don’t
   know how to do it in real life.”

   There was something else she was looking for too. After zooming into
   the spotlight as a rising Hollywood star and the anchor of two
   groundbreaking Asian American hit projects, she was on the hunt for
   roles that were multidimensional, human, complex.

   “In every project I choose, I want a character that gets to run the
   gamut of a full spectrum of an arc,” said Wu, whose “Hustlers”
   character, like the women around her, contains multitudes: The daughter
   of immigrants and a single mother herself, she’s a ladyboss in the
   making — until she’s left holding the designer bag. “Destiny has
   moments where she’s really funny, and moments when she’s really sad.
   Moments where she’s irresponsible, moments where she’s the only one who
   is responsible. That complexity is what I seek in any role, and this
   script really afforded her that journey.”

   Scafaria (“Seeking a Friend for the End of the World,” “The Meddler”)
   wrote the screenplay, imagining Lopez as the perfect Ramona, the
   ringleader set on turning the tables on the sleazy suits who
   underestimate women like her. Signing Lopez was the first piece of the
   casting puzzle for “Hustlers,” which STX acquired for production after
   a struggling Annapurna put the film in turnaround. (Annapurna head
   Megan Ellison remains an executive producer on the film.)

   The search for Destiny led to Wu, and then to the stacked ensemble,
   which includes Keke Palmer, Lili Reinhart, Julia Stiles, Mercedes
   Ruehl, Madeline Brewer, Trace Lysette, Lizzo (and her flute) and Cardi
   B.

   “Constance connected with this and wanted a shot at doing something
   that is obviously so different from anything we’ve ever seen her do,”
   said producer Jessica Elbaum, who optioned Jessica Pressler’s original
   article for Gloria Sanchez Productions.

   As soon as they met, Scafaria and Wu clicked. “I saw that she has a
   fragility and a vulnerability and a sensitivity and a very deep core,”
   said the writer-director. “She’s obviously a very gifted comedic
   actress, and she brought me to tears in ‘Crazy Rich Asians,’ so she is
   an incredible dramatic actress too. But I think she has weight and
   chops. And when I met her, I felt that.

   “I couldn’t be more proud of her,” Scafaria said of the actress. “She
   put herself out there; she tweezed those eyebrows up to 2007!”

   Filming began in New York this spring before STX, which has recently
   endured a series of flops including “UglyDolls” and “Poms,”
   fast-tracked “Hustlers” for a fall release. (Early tracking suggests
   the film could debut to the studio’s highest opening weekend gross
   ever.)
   “Hustlers” follows a crew of savvy former strip club employees who band
   together to turn the tables on their Wall Street clients. It stars
   Constance Wu, Jennifer Lopez, Lizzo, Cardi B. and more.

   To prepare for the role, Wu studied hours of interview tapes of
   Destiny’s real-life inspiration, former dancer Roselyn Keo, playing
   them on a loop in her trailer for reference. “When a culture at large
   judges you, in a way, there is camaraderie amongst each other because
   we know who we are even though they don’t,” Wu said of meeting
   real-life strippers for research.

   “Hustlers” aims to do justice to the unseen dimensions of these women’s
   lives. “That’s why we make movies like this. These women are trying
   their best in a world that has not always been fair to them. That’s the
   hustle: trying to get that dream when you started out 10 steps behind
   everybody else.”

   She impressed costar and producer Lopez during a scene in which their
   characters, who become both business partners and close friends, begin
   to disagree on the limits of their increasingly volatile scam
   operation.

   “There is a scene in the movie that we filmed early on where Destiny
   and Ramona get into a fight, and Constance really went for it,” said
   Lopez in an email. “And I was like, ‘Wow! OK. She is a gangster. We are
   going to do this movie.’ I think their story lines are fascinating
   because they start very similarly — same desires, same goals. But as
   they come more into their power and into more ‘success,’ their stories
   and thus their friendship really starts to diverge.”
   “This whole country is a strip club. You’ve got people throwing the
   money and you’ve got people doing the dance.”
   (STX Films)

   Wu could have taken easier roads after her “Crazy Rich Asians” success.
   The Richmond, Va., native had chased the classic actor hustle for
   years, working in theater, on TV and in indie films before scoring
   breakout status on “Fresh Off the Boat” opposite Randall Park and
   Hudson Yang.

   Premiering in 2015, it was the first Asian American-led sitcom to hit
   prime-time in 20 years. By 2017, Wu had been named one of Time’s Most
   Influential People, buoyed by her vocal activism online and in the
   Time’s Up movement. The same year, she was cast in “Crazy Rich Asians,”
   which also made history as the first Asian American-centered studio
   film in a quarter century. In the wake of “Crazy Rich Asians,” Wu is
   now able to get projects green-lighted, such as the upcoming novel
   adaptation “Goodbye, Vitamin,” in which she’ll star and executive
   produce.

   But with great power and over 1 million followers on social media comes
   great accountability, a lesson Wu admits she was still learning earlier
   this year when she posted negative reactions on Twitter and Instagram
   to the news that “Fresh Off the Boat” had been renewed for a sixth
   season.

   The blowback was immediate. Wu quickly apologized and provided context,
   saying she was upset that she’d have to forgo another project. “My
   words and ill-timing were insensitive to those who are struggling,
   especially insensitive considering the fact that I used to be in that
   struggle too. I do regret that and it wasn’t nice and I am sorry for
   that,” she wrote in a lengthy Instagram post.

   Though she didn’t go into detail at the time, it wasn’t another film
   but a play she’d been hoping to do — one in which she would have played
   a “not Asian-specific” role and likely worked for scale — that Wu had
   to give up to return to her show, for which she is under contract for
   another two years.

   “I had this moment of heat where I got upset because I had to give up a
   job I had been looking forward to and had been chasing for a while,”
   she said of her self-described “Twitter fiasco.” “It was moving to me
   how many people from the show reached out to me, and even on set ... to
   say, ‘Just so you know, we love you and we know who you are, and you
   didn’t deserve any of that stuff.’ Because they also know that I’m an
   actress — I can be dramatic.”

   Actors admitting they’re dramatic? A rarity! She laughed. “I mean,
   that’s our toolkit, right? I’m dramatic. I’m emotional. But they also
   know that that doesn’t represent me because they have a hundred
   episodes of behavior that proves otherwise.”
   “I don’t want to be in one box. There’s a part of me that’s like
   Jessica Huang, that’s why I can play her. There’s a part of me that’s
   like Destiny, that’s why I can play her.”
   (Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times)

   She also learned a lesson from the backlash: Her platform affords her a
   greater reach than she realized. “I’m not beating myself up for it,
   because I know me,” said Wu. “But I don’t think I realized that people
   were paying so much attention to my Twitter.”

   At the time, she wasn’t sure the show would get renewed for a sixth
   season. Now, a part of her worries she’ll be blamed if Season 6 is its
   last. Still, Wu says, she regrets that her tweets affected others,
   including castmates, colleagues and ABC president Karey Burke.

   “I like that people are expressing their feelings about it, because it
   improved my awareness of what it means to be a ... public figure,” She
   paused, turning over the phrase. “I’ve had a back-and-forth about it.
   It’s the line between being a role model but also authenticity.”

   “I think a lot of why people are lonely in this world is because they
   go through these Instagram feeds and everybody’s life is perfect,” she
   said. “Nobody trips up. And sometimes I think, might it be good to see
   our heroes mess up a little bit and not always be perfect?”

   Imperfection is a quality seldom afforded those who carry the added
   mantle of representation. If Wu’s Asian American fans were particularly
   disappointed by her tweets, it may be because they were rooting for her
   to succeed, an emblem to champion in a Hollywood that’s still so slow
   to change. Can the public allow Wu to be fallible and human, still
   speak her mind, and learn as she goes?

   “There is an expectation of the way that I ought to behave, and not
   just of perfection but of graciousness. And I am grateful. But am I
   elegant?” she said with a laugh. “No. I think I can be verbally
   eloquent sometimes, but as a human, am I an elegant person? No.”

     Me getting to play a fully human experience as an Asian American,
     that shouldn’t be historic. But it is.

   Constance Wu

   As a wise oracle once sang, “A diva is a female version of a hustler.”
   Yet Wu, who just filled out her summer by paying her own way to Hawaii
   to act in an indie film for an emerging Asian American director, found
   herself at the center of headlines during the “Hustlers” promo tour
   describing her as a “diva.”

   Wu considered the label. “A woman owning her power rather than being
   like, ‘Who, me?,’ I think, is a threat to the patriarchy,” said Wu. “I
   know some people were like, ‘Constance demanded top billing.’ No, the
   script had me as the lead. But it’s a juicier story to say the other
   stuff.

   “I am grateful for my entire career,” she said. “But the fact that my
   career has been historic shouldn’t necessarily be a call [to say to]
   me, ‘You should be so lucky’ — it should be a call to pay attention to
   the fact that this kind of thing shouldn’t have been historic. Me
   getting to play a fully human experience as an Asian American, that
   shouldn’t be historic. But it is. Let’s talk about the system, not
   whether or not I deserve to be in it and how I need to feel about it.”

   Wu reiterated that her platform, even if it comes with public scrutiny,
   is not something she takes for granted.

   “I do think when you have a platform, you ought to make sure you use it
   as well and responsibly as you can,” said Wu, who returns to TV with
   the season premiere of “Fresh Off the Boat” on Sept. 27.

   “But,” she continued, flashing a wry smile, “I want to be careful not
   to blow up my profile any more. If it happens as a natural extension of
   me doing the thing that I think I am meant to do, which is to be an
   actor, then I welcome it and I’m grateful for it. That’s not the part
   of myself I’m seeking to put energy into ... but it teaches me.”
