Minnesota United FC Details

   Since joining Major League Soccer for its inaugural season in 2017,
   Minnesota United has built on the passionate fan base the club
   established during its time in the NASL and now, in its third year,
   will open its new home as it moves into the soccer-specific Allianz
   Field for 2019.

   From its very first MLS home opener in driving snow and sub-20 degree
   temperatures in 2017 to the club’s first hat trick by Designated Player
   Darwin Quintero against Toronto FC in 2018 to the massive crowd of
   52,242 that broke a Minnesota pro soccer attendance record to finish
   out the team’s tenure at TCF Bank Stadium on the campus of the
   University of Minnesota, Minnesota United’s games have often turned
   into events. Driven by the supporters groups who will pack the
   Wonderwall safe-standing section at Allianz Field, the gameday
   atmosphere is unparalleled in Minnesota sports and will be amplified
   several times over at the new stadium.

   With the signings of MLS veterans Ike Opara and Ozzie Alonso and the
   acquisition of its third Designated Player, Jan Gregus, Minnesota
   United has its sights set squarely on turning its new home into a
   fortress and bringing a new level of grit and toughness to the Twin
   Cities.
