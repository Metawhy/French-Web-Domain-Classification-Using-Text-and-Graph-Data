Bailey's Art Party!

   [3E.jpg]

     Oh my goodness, I can't even believe I'm saying this, but my sweet
   Bailey girl is EIGHT!!! Eight, as in the number 8.  Goodness, she was 8
   months just yesterday...how does this happen!?!?!  I say it every time,
             but ugh...HOW do we slow this time thing down!?!?!

                      Ok, enough of the heavy stuff...

   This was SUCH a fun party theme!!!  Bailey loved the idea of having an
    art party since she loves crafts (just like her mama).  First stop in
      party planning, contact my party design expert Amanda of AMANDAS
    PARTIES TO GO and find her suuuuuuper colorful, gorgeous, PERFECT art
               party collection and plan a party around it! ;)

   I love the way this party turned out.  I'm a sucker for color and this
   one has LOTS of it!!!  If you're planning an art party, this printable
       collection is a MUST!  RIGHT HERE is where you can get your own
                        personalized set.  So fab! ;)

          Ok, here we go....our Bailey's 8th Birthday ART Party!!!

                              Cake first...﻿

    "Blank Canvas" cookies.  Later in the party the kids decorated these
            sugar cookies using Americolor edible ink markers.﻿

                                     ﻿

   Wrapped candy bars...

    One of Bailey's favorite candies are these wax liquid sugar thingies.
     Not even sure what they're called, but we played them off as paint
   tubes.  ;)  She was thrilled that they made an appearance on the table!

     Juice boxes turned into crayons using the wraps from Amanda's
   collection.
   [IMG_2798+(2)E.jpg]
    I  turned dollar store paint brushes into ribbon streamer wands by hot
   gluing ribbon to the base of the brushes (where the brush meets the
   handle).

   This was a fun little punch game I made.  Under each color (tissue
   paper) was a prize.  The girls used the paint brush to break the tissue
   paper and reveal their prize.
