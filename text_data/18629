Thank you

   Dear ICRA attendees,

   Thank you for helping make ICRA 2019 in Montreal such a success,
   setting records for papers published, attendance and several other
   factors.  It was an immense pleasure to see our community come
   together, especially in an era of such rapid progress, increasing
   diversity and with so many opportunities in the offering.

   I'd like to invite you to help asses some of the things we tried, and
   help future organizers, but completing the short post-conference survey
   until June 15.

   Thank you again, Gregory Dudek
   Conference Chair, ICRA 2019
