One-Bowl Chocolate Cake

   Posted on March 23, 2016 by Veronica

   This is a very simple chocolate cake but I daresay it might be even
   better then my previous favorite. It is incredibly moist and so tender,
   with the perfect amount of chocolate flavor. It is a perfect cake to
   whip up when you don’t have time for a fussy recipe, and who needs
   fussy when simplicity brings such deliciousness? I hope you try it.

One-Bowl Chocolate Cake

   Printable recipe

   Printable recipe with picture

   2 cups all-purpose flour

   2 cups sugar

   1/2 cup baking cocoa

   2 teaspoons baking soda

   1 teaspoon baking powder

   1/2 teaspoon salt

   2 large eggs, lightly beaten

   1 cup canola oil

   1 cup buttermilk

   1 cup hot water

   Frosting of your choice

   Colored sprinkles, optional

   Preheat oven to 350°. Grease a 13×9-in. baking pan, or spray with
   cooking oil. In a large bowl, whisk the first six ingredients. Stir in
   eggs, oil and buttermilk. Add water; stir until combined.

   Transfer batter to prepared pan. Bake 35-40 minutes or until a
   toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool completely in pan on
   a wire rack. Frost cake. If desired, decorate with sprinkles.

   Chocolate Buttercream Frosting: In a large bowl, beat 1/2 cup softened
   butter until creamy. Beat in 2 cups confectioners’ sugar, 1/4 cup
   baking cocoa, 1-1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract and 3-4 tablespoons 2%
   milk (I used heavy cream) to achieve desired consistency.

   *Veronica’s notes: I sifted my dry ingredients since my cocoa powder
   was really lumpy. If you find yourself in the same boat, with big
   clumps of cocoa powder in the dry ingredients that won’t mix out, I
   would suggest sifting so you don’t have any clumps.

I’m still alive! :)

   Posted on March 9, 2016 by Veronica

   Once upon a time I wrote posts 3-5 days out of the week and I felt like
   my readers were friends. I don’t know how many of you really even know
   me any more, it’s been so long since I’ve shared my heart (and
   recipes!) like I used to in the good ol’ days. Or even followed others’
   blogs! I do miss that, but wouldn’t trade it for the time I now spend
   with my little homey. I wanted him my whole life, and blogging just
   isn’t as important to me right now. The days fly by and I know that
   soon this brief time in my life, raising the child I always wanted,
   will be over.  I’m just soaking them up!

   But today my little guy is out of town for a sleepover with his
   grandparents, and I have some time all to myself, and I believe I’m way
   overdue for an update! Last time I blogged, I mentioned our fundraising
   efforts to afford the fertility treatments we need to give Joshua a
   sibling. I also mentioned professional photos and it’s about time I
   share those (which you can see two of them above) and update on the
   former!

   Our fundraising went very well and we are gearing up for our first IUI
   of this year.  Several blog readers donated, some that were just
   stopping in for a random recipe and saw the fundraiser link, and I’m so
   grateful for this help, thank you. I have been going to a chiropractor
   since we started fundraising, and we’ve both done natural (herbal)
   things to help our fertility. A large percentage of the money raised,
   as well as money of our own, went to these natural treatments but it
   was money well spent.  Quite a bit went into consultations, blood
   tests, fertility drugs (non-herbal), and sonograms as well. I’ve even
   been doing acupuncture in hopes to give myself an extra fertility
   boost!

   We got to a point where we were ready to move forward with an IUI and
   we needed one more fundraiser to meet our goal so we did a chili
   cook-off & silent auction.  This was our most successful fundraiser (I
   also did a cupcake sale, a garage sale, and a Mary Kay party) and was
   also the easiest!

   The cookies were glued to the plate and he was pretty mad they weren’t
   real. He tried so hard to get them off! lol

   So now we are excited and looking forward to the IUI, amazed how God
   has guided and blessed us through this journey, through family,
   friends, and even strangers.  Taking heart that this is the path we
   were meant to take, and hoping for a positive outcome, though we know
   that is not a guarantee. No one knows that more than us.  After
   thirteen years to get our son, and a failed IUI last year, we know.  I
   still can’t help but be very hopeful, as I’ve never been on this many
   drugs (for fertility) before, LOL!

   So that’s the excitement going on for us right now.  Hopefully I will
   have some good news for you guys some time this year, as it’s the last
   year we will be trying. :) Prayers are much appreciated! <3

Thomas the Cupcake Train!

   Posted on January 5, 2016 by Veronica

   Oh boy, time has really gotten away from me. I can’t believe my last
   post was in September!  I wanted to post our professional photos we had
   done for Christmas, then realized I hadn’t even shared about Joshua’s
   birthday so I better do that first. He turned two on November 23rd!

   This little guy is very into trains. I can’t even tell you the number
   of times I hear “choo choo!” a day, either because he hears a train,
   sees a train track, is playing with trains, or sees Thomas on his socks
   & pajamas, or on TV. He finds trains everywhere, like on a Christmas
   tree figurine I never even noticed a train was at the base of, or in
   the background of pictures in books. You never know how surrounded you
   are by trains until you have a toddler signaling their presence once
   every few minutes. Needless to say, we went with a Thomas the Train
   theme for his birthday this year.

   This was his Halloween costume, and the photos worked nicely for his
   birthday invitations.

   I saw a really cool cupcake train idea on A Britt Without Boys (see her
   post for a much better train, and tutorial), and was really excited to
   make it. It was very simple to put together and while mine didn’t look
   as great as Brittney’s, everyone loved it and it was a hit!

   Basically you need a large engine to start the train off with, if you
   want to go with Thomas I’d look into the “My First Thomas” set you can
   get at Target for around $20. I went with a projector toy I found on
   eBay that was a bit too small, and I’m not sure the My First Thomas is
   bigger but it seemed to be in the online pictures. Then you need
   cupcakes, the number is up to you. You need half as many graham
   crackers as cupcakes, and 4 large marshmallows and Oreo’s per graham
   cracker.

   “Glue” marshmallows with melted chocolate (I used a disposable piping
   bag that I melted white chocolate chips in the microwave) onto the
   bottom of the graham crackers where you want the tires to be. Place
   them marshmallow side down and then glue Oreo’s over the outside of
   each marshmallow to make them look more like train wheels.  To set up
   the train, arrange two cupcakes per graham cracker and set up in a line
   behind the engine. Add candles and you’re done! I got the “Happy
   Birthday” candle set for $1 at Dollar Tree.

   He started out dressed in his train engineer costume but HAD to put on
   the Thomas jammies from Auntie Joan as soon as they were out of the
   gift bag!

   I didn’t get too crazy with the decorations, just cheap stuff in basic
   colors that went with the Thomas theme, but I did put some creativity
   into the favor bags.  I got blue paper bags 3/$1 at Walmart, then
   designed my own labels for them and stuck them on with double sided
   tape. I include a wooden train whistle ($1 at Dollar Tree), Train Smoke
   (Vanilla Snow Cotton Candy, $1 from Dollar Tree, filled 6 bags),
   bubbles (8-pack of wedding bubbles $1 at Dollar Tree, printed out my
   own Thomas’s and taped them on), and a few fun-size candy bars that I
   got half price after Halloween. What can I say, I’m thrifty!

   And this was the front of the thank-you cards I designed and mailed to
   those who gave him a gift. I print my “cards” at Walmart as 4×6 photos
   for about a quarter each with tax (for 1 hour, only 9 cents if you can
   wait for home delivery). If it’s just a card front like this, I cut out
   some card stock to size, fold it, and tape the picture to the front,
   then write a message inside. Can’t beat a personalized card for a
   quarter!

   Oh and one more cute thing from the party, my Mother-in-Law, with the
   help of her artistic sister, made this Thomas veggie train with a
   cardboard Thomas they made “from scratch” and long baskets (I’ve seen
   these at Dollar Tree, like MIL, like DIL!) filled with veggies. It
   looked much cooler spread out until I pushed it aside to make way for
   my big crock pot full of Easy White Chicken Chili, but you get the
   idea.

   I didn’t do any games but had a coloring table set up just in case
   there were slow points and children got bored, but it actually ended up
   being filled with all adults! My sisters joined after I took this
   picture. I printed this Thomas Birthday Express coloring sheet and they
   went to town while they waited for everyone to finish eating and the
   presents to begin.

   I purposely kept the decorating and prep to a minimum to avoid stress
   and it was a really enjoyable party!  I wonder how many more years I’ll
   be able to continue my cake strike before this little boy starts
   working on me and convinces me to make a dragon cake like his cousin
   did once upon a time. For now, I’m enjoying cupcaking it up! hehe.

Velvet Banana Bread – my blue ribbon winner!

   Posted on September 23, 2015 by Veronica

   It all started in 2009 when I entered the foods competitions at the
   Kansas State Fair for the first time, and met a wonderful & talented
   woman named Colleen Woker.  We met while watching the pie judging and I
   asked her if she’d won any ribbons in the other competitions. She
   listed off approximately 241 things she’d placed in, including getting
   “Best in Show” for her banana bread, which as far as I understand means
   that her banana bread was so good, that the judges deemed it better
   than anything else submitted for judging in the foods competitions. I
   mean, it beat cakes!  CAKES! I was so impressed by her and in that
   moment, knew that some day I had to get myself a blue ribbon in the
   banana bread competition.  Little did I know it would become nearly an
   obsession.

   In my quest to win a blue ribbon, I’ve made over fifty different banana
   bread recipes, and no matter how hard I tried to find the best, most
   perfect banana bread, the highest I ever placed was 3rd.  I really
   thought I was doomed to never get my blue ribbon, or even a red one.
   This year I had no idea what recipe I was going to make until the day
   before the competition.  In fact, I had even forgotten to buy bananas
   in advance to let them get super duper ripe, and all I had was bananas
   that were still green at the stems.  Not acceptable!

   I posted a last minute plea on Facebook for rotten bananas and was
   given some by two wonderful women (thank you Lacey & Lisa!), enough to
   make a practice loaf or two if I could find the time.  I decided to
   take my best good friend, Jackie‘s, advice and replace the pumpkin in
   my most favoritest pumpkin bread recipe with bananas, which she has
   been doing for a year.  That recipe has 1/2 cup of water in it, which
   I’d never ever seen in all the banana bread recipes I’ve read in my
   search for the perfect one, and I was so scared to try it.  I asked her
   probably five times, “Do you really put the water in it when you make
   it? REALLY?” She assured me she did, and that it wasn’t wet or gummy,
   but really similar in texture to the pumpkin bread.  That sold me,
   because that soft texture is the ultimate for me in a quick bread.

   Despite my deep fears of including the water, and the temptation to
   replace it with something more exciting like milk or pineapple juice, I
   gave her idea a go, adding a touch of cardamom, and was absolutely
   floored by the result.  I had never in my life had such tender, soft
   banana bread.  And so delicious, sweet & perfectly banana-y with a the
   perfect balance of spices to set it off.  Unfortunately, it was one of
   the uglier loaves I’d ever made, and since 25% of the judging score was
   based on appearance, I lost all hope right there.  Because I knew it
   was too good not to submit, but also knew it was too ugly to win a blue
   ribbon. I just hoped it was good enough to win a red.

   So many things went wrong in making the official loaf and my spirits
   sunk deeper and deeper with each obstacle. I kept questioning why I was
   even bothering.  This wasn’t the regular little banana bread
   competition, this one was sponsored by King Arthur Flour and the first
   place prize was a $150 gift card to their catalog, which is much bigger
   than the usual $9 prize.  This was a big deal, and more people would be
   entering than usual.  I didn’t have a chance! I was exhausted, would
   have loved to sleep in the next morning, didn’t want to waste the gas
   or the effort when I knew it was hopeless, but I’d been in the paper
   about the being the Banana Bread Queen Wannabe, and everyone on
   Facebook knew about it.  I had to go.

   When I arrived to submit my bread, I noticed that everyone around me
   had loaves that were the same dark shiny brown, which I found
   unattractive.  That made me feel a little better, until I looked to see
   if any of my other three baked goods I’d already turned in had placed,
   and they hadn’t.  I knew it was going to be my very first no-ribbon
   year, and I went home defeated, knowing my quest might never end.

   But when we returned to the fair as a family two days later, there it
   was. My ugly brown banana bread sitting front and center.  Next to a
   blue ribbon.

   I squealed. I hopped around.  I squealed and hopped some more.  I think
   there was a lot of, “I can’t believe it!!”  I gushed my entire banana
   bread story to the poor couple standing nearby when my freak out
   started.  They were so happy for me, but everyone else looked pretty
   perturbed & disturbed by my antics.  I stopped myself several times
   from running up to random people to tell them I won.  Joshua was
   grinning and giggling, clearly trying to figure out what had Mom so
   excited.  I took his hands and we did a little celebration dance
   together.  When Dennis approached us (he’d been in the bathroom), I
   wanted to let him discover it on his own but I just couldn’t contain
   myself and as soon as I saw him I beamed and jumped up and down and
   waved him over, pointing wildly at the display case where my winning
   bread resided. He knew instantly of course what that meant, and he
   hopped up and down with me a little in celebration.  Joshua was so
   happy to see all the happiness and I was so happy, and Dennis was so
   happy, I thought all our heads might explode.

   It took six years and countless loaves of banana bread, but I did it.
   The blue ribbon is MINE! Thanks be to God, to Jackie, Lisa, Lacey, and
   to Colleen for not entering the banana bread competition this year and
   giving me a chance.  And to everyone who has rooted for me all these
   years, thank you!!  My quest is complete and I couldn’t be happier to
   have found my very favorite recipe for banana bread and gotten the blue
   for it so that I never have to try another recipe again.  I’m so DONE
   with new banana bread recipes.  This one is definitely my new favorite,
   and I truly may never make another recipe again.

Velvet Banana Bread

   Printable recipe
   Printable recipe with picture

   1 cup (8 oz) mashed overripe banana
   1 1/2 cups (10 1/2 oz) granulated sugar
   1/2 cup (4 1/8 oz) vegetable oil
   1/2 cup (4 oz) water
   2 large eggs
   1 3/4 cups (7 1/2 oz) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
   1 teaspoon baking soda
   1 teaspoon cinnamon
   1/2 teaspoon salt
   1/2 teaspoon baking powder
   1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
   1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
   1/4 teaspoon cardamom

   Preheat oven to 350F. In a large mixing bowl, combine banana, sugar,
   vegetable oil, water, and eggs. Whisk until well mixed. Measure the
   flour, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, baking powder, nutmeg, and cloves
   into a separate bowl and stir until combined. Slowly add the dry
   ingredients to the banana mixture, beating until smooth. Mixture will
   be very very thin and it’s OK to mix until no flour streaks remain, but
   if you see little lumps of flour that won’t mix out, don’t sweat it,
   they will dissolve while baking and overmixing will make this tender
   loaf tough and dry.

   Spray the bottom of a 9×5 loaf pan and pour batter in (if your pan
   sticks, go ahead and grease the whole thing). Bake for 60-70 minutes or
   until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Immediately
   remove from pan, and cool at least 15 minutes before slicing. Remove
   from pan immediately and allow to cool at least 15 minutes on a wire
   rack before slicing. Cool completely before wrapping leftovers in
   plastic wrap.

   Veronica’s notes: If you aren’t measuring your ingredients on a scale,
   please use a very light hand when measuring the flour, spooning it
   gently into the cup and not packing it at all before leveling it.

   Also, I only left the sides of my pan ungreased because the state fair
   judges have disqualified me in the past for greasing the whole pan.
   According to them, this is a baking sin and the sides of your bread
   will be much more tender if you grease only the bottom. This works fine
   with my new nifty galifty USA Loaf Pan because it’s crazy nonstick, but
   if you have any other not fabulously non-stick pan, you’d better go
   ahead and grease the sides. I honestly can’t tell a difference in the
   finished loaf whether the sides have been greased or not, the judges
   need to chill.

   Speaking of loaf pans, be sure to use a large 9×5 as this is too much
   batter for an 8×4 loaf pan.  If you only have a small loaf pan, make
   some muffins with the extra batter, but don’t fill your pan more than
   3/4 full.

   Lastly, if you overbake your loaf a bit (I did on the one photographed,
   by a couple minutes because I was busy when the timer went off), don’t
   forget my water trick. It works on quick breads as well as cakes! Spray
   the sides and bottom well with water, don’t be shy with it, and it will
   all absorb while cooling and soften those hardened edges right up.

Supporting your infertile friends & The Stork OTC giveaway *CLOSED*

   Posted on September 21, 2015 by Veronica

   *This giveaway is now closed. Congratulations to Laura
   (dandelionsarenotweeds6)!*

   I know, you are waiting for my blue ribbon banana bread recipe (still
   happy dancing) I promised last week! Well it is still coming, I’ve
   gotta take pictures of the loaf I just baked, and in the mean time I
   have something very near and dear to my hear to talk to you about, and
   there is a giveaway involved so don’t be too hasty to close the window
   in a fit of banana bread frustration. ;)

   Before the incredible gift of our son, I shared fairly often about my
   personal 13-year struggle with infertility, and the heartbreak.
   There’s nothing quite like infertility to make you realize you’re
   really not in full control here. You can do everything within your
   power to improve your chances, from natural remedies to
   over-the-counter, to medical help…and you still may never get
   pregnant.  It’s hard to want something so badly, and not be able to
   accomplish it no matter the lengths you go to, or how hard you pray.

   Which is why I agreed to join The Stork OTC with other bloggers to help
   raise awareness about how to support infertile couples and to introduce
   you to their nifty at-home conception device (with a chance to win one,
   and more, stay tuned!).  Even if you’ve never suffered from
   infertility, or known anyone else who did, chances are there is more
   than one couple you know that does, and has never revealed it.
   Infertility is largely suffered with silent tears because it’s a very
   personal struggle that is awkward and embarrassing to share even with
   close loved ones.  (After fifteen years, I’m mostly past that, and it’s
   also easier to share to a larger semi-anonymous audience than it is
   one-on-one.)

   Some things you should know:

   Infertility doesn’t affect every person the same way, but in general
   these are some things that can be difficult for us (or even
   heartbreaking, depending on the day):
     * Pregnancy announcements. Personally these aren’t as hard for me as
       other infertiles I know, but at times, they have brought me to my
       knees.
     * Baby showers. Though I’m the odd infertile duck that really LOVES
       baby showers (part of it is the white cake, I just love it, LOL),
       I’m ashamed to admit that there have been times when I couldn’t
       force myself to go to them because my circumstances grieved me too
       much to join in the celebration.  I know it sounds terrible –
       jealous and selfish, and I was. Infertility can really put the ugly
       on beautiful things.
     * Mother’s Day, especially if at a place or function where mothers
       are singled out and honored in a way that shows them apart from the
       women they hope to be some day, and don’t know if they will ever
       be. This can be really shaming to infertile women, almost a
       pointing finger showing them unable to achieve what every other
       woman that wants to can.
     * Questions like, “When are you guys going to have a baby?” This
       truly isn’t an appropriate question to ask anyone, but especially
       if they’re infertile.  No matter who it is, this simply is not your
       business, and if the couple has been trying for an extended time
       without your knowledge, a question like that can really rip into
       their heart.
     * Hearing a pregnant woman or mother bitterly complaining about her
       pregnancy or child/children.  Having now been through pregnancy and
       mothering my own child, I know there are lots of hard times, but I
       make a point to only vent/complain to those who get it because I
       know how easy it is to hurt those who would give anything for the
       hard times by complaining.

   This short list isn’t so much advice as information to help you
   understand your infertile friends and family a little better.  For a
   really wonderful series that is far more extensive with advice, you can
   start reading “Loving Your Friend Through Infertility.”  But if you’re
   looking for the short and sweet answer, it’s this: the best thing you
   can do is simply offer your love, prayers, and support.  And if
   possible, lots of hugs and a shoulder to cry on.

   Now for the fun part, a giveaway!  If you are trying to conceive and
   it’s taking longer than you anticipated, using The Stork OTC is a nifty

I won! THE BLUE RIBBON IS MIIIIIIINE!

   Posted on September 18, 2015 by Veronica

   Excuse the screaming but…

   I WON! I WON! I WON! I won the King Arthur Flour Banana Bread
   Competition at the Kansas State Fair!

   I think after six years and over fifty different banana bread recipes
   tried, I’ve earned the right to yell a little about FINALLY WINNING A
   BLUE RIBBON!!! The curse has been lifted! LOL!

   I know the photo is horrible and you can’t even see my name, but I will
   have better photos (from a friend who’s going to the fair tomorrow, I
   forgot my camera and had to use my horrible camera phone) and a recipe
   for you next week!! In the mean time, I’m going to spend the weekend
   doing a celebratory dance on the rooftop. Ha!

Some Updatey Stuff

   Posted on September 14, 2015 by Veronica

   photo IMG_2705b.jpg

   Well my weekly posting was short-lived, but life has been a whirlwind
   lately.  Look how much my boy has grown up since I last posted! Can you
   even believe he’s the same baby I introduced you guys to less than two
   years ago? Time just FLIES when you’re having fun, and I’m enjoying
   every fleeting second.

   In other news, I was interviewed after dropping off my (whopping three)
   baked goods at the fair this year, and ended up in the Hutchinson
   newspaper on Saturday. If you click the photo you can enlarge it to
   read it if you like.

   So now everyone knows I’m just a wannabe. Ha!! And by the way, it’s not
   true that I place 3rd every year. I’ve placed 3rd twice (for my
   Favorite Banana Bread and Black Walnut Banana Bread), and didn’t place
   at all the other times. So yeah, pretty much doomed. It’s also not true
   that I’m “cautiously optimistic,” as I have no hope for placing with
   the banana bread competition this year.  In fact, I have no idea what
   recipe I’m even going to make even though I have to make it today. But
   I’m entering anyway. Pretty sure I’ll be doing this until I die, I’m
   all in and can’t stop now, even if it feels foolhardy and a time waste
   at this point. LOL! For new readers, you can see all about my banana
   bread journey here.

   We’ve also decided to do some fundraising to try and give our son a
   sibling, and I raised $320 (profit) selling a ton of cupcakes at my
   sister’s shop recently, and am currently organizing a garage sale that
   will be mainly donated items. My wonderful friend, Holly, started a
   Gofundme page for us that you can check out here if you want the scoop.

   Joshua is currently recovering from his first bout with strep throat,
   which has been hard on all of us. Thankfully he loves his medicine and
   is doing so much better already.  It is so hard seeing your baby in so
   much pain, and I was so relieved when the doc said it was strep. If it
   had been a virus we just had to ride out, I don’t know what I would
   have done with myself. I was about to lose it, because nothing I did
   was enough to make him feel better, not the Motrin every four hours,
   not the Hyland’s cough syrup, not diffusing Thieves oil, not feeding
   him fresh pineapple, and he could hardly stand to eat and drink so he
   lost his baby fat again. (He had the stomach flu at the beginning of
   the year and couldn’t eat for almost a week, that was the first time he
   lost it.)  So everyone is much happier now, and we’re all trying to
   catch up on lost sleep.  Hopefully Joshua will be eating like a pig
   soon and getting back the little thigh rolls I adore so much.

   I’ll be sure to update you guys on the banana bread competition when I
   find out. If you don’t hear from me this week, you can assume it’s more
   bad news. Ha! ;)
