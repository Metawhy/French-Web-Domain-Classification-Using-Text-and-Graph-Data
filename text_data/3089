   Retro-Game-Collection-Tracking-Online To kick start the new year,
   RetroCollect has added some great new features to the rarity guide &
   release list database. As of now, you can track your retro games
   collection with us and share your lists with anyone online.

   The next time you are logged in and are browsing the RetroCollect
   rarity guide & release lists, many collection tracking icons will begin
   to appear across the database's pages. These allow you to add games to
   your collection and show the ones you have already added. There will
   also be a quick link such as this one, which will allow you to view
   your own collection list of every game you have added to your online
   collection tracker.

   It's as simple as browsing the consoles/platforms you own games for, or
   searching for specific games and clicking 'add' to place the game into
   your collection page. Should you make a mistake, you can hover over the
   'Got' icon and click the delete button on an individual game to remove
   it and continue to adjust your collection as necessary.

   Many RetroCollect users have already begun using the online retro game
   collection tracker such as GMass who is currently showing off his
   wealthy Sega Dreamcast collection or even my own list with my
   collection of Commodore Amiga and Pokemon Mini games.

   I have all my N64, Game Boy and Game Boy Color games in.
   I have 3/4 of my GBA games in.
   I am disappointed on how some of my [DEL: favorite :DEL] GameCube games
   are missing from the database. Here's what you missed: Pac-Man Fever,
   Muppets Party Cruise, Battle for Volcano Island, Meet the Robinsons,
   and the biggest surprise, Harvest Moon: Magical Melody.

Ultimate Guide To Retro Gaming Flash Cards, Cartridges & Backup Devices

   24 October 2015 Cauterize Guides - Tutorials

   Guide-To-Retro-Gaming-Flash-Cards While retro games in their physical
   form are still incredibly desirable and our first port of call for
   gaming action, flash cartridges have begun paving the way for much
   quicker and easier access to the games we love. With countless options
   on offer at varying costs, RetroCollect has compiled the ultimate and
   comprehensive guide to flash cards, cartridges and backup devices.

   If you’re yet to become familiar with the term ‘flash cartridges’ or
   even use one, then you’re in for a treat. These impressive devices
   often mimic an original game cartridge (or media) in shape, however,
   their on-board software is anything but a game. The code hidden within
   one of these devices usually grants access to an on-screen menu driven
   interface to which you can access a whole library of games.

   For example, the more recent Everdrive cartridges for the Sega Mega
   Drive have a small slot on the top which allows you to insert a SD card
   filled with game ROMs. All of which can be selected and played as if
   that game was actually plugged into your console.

   There are many additional advantages to using flash cartridges and
   backup devices today. For starters, the most obscure releases from
   abroad are simply a click away and ready to be played on the original
   hardware. These feature packed devices also offer access to the
   wonderful world of homebrew and ROM hacks, games and alterations to
   existing titles which have been created by talented individuals -
   including the ability to run the equivalent to Mega CD games on an
   unmodified Super Nintendo.

   In short, flash cartridges will open up your systems to just about
   anything your retro gaming heart desires. But which consoles have such
   hardware at the ready and what might be the best choice for each
   system?

   Read on and prepare to be educated...

   Please note - this guide is intended for gamers looking to find a
   solution for enjoying homebrew software on retro gaming consoles, and a
   legal alternative for enjoying the games they already own. RetroCollect
   does not encourage piracy nor condone it in any shape or form, nor will
   it encourage downloading ROM files or the sharing of illegal software.
   While these devices can show a dark side, we write about them with the
   best intentions in mind. At the same time we hold no responsibility for
   any damage these third party devices may cause to your belongings.

Nintendo NES / Famicom Flash Cartridges

   Nintendo-NES-Flash-Cartridges

NES / Famicom Everdrive N8

   Krikzz of Everdrive fame has finally released the ultimate solution to
   the Nintendo NES, similar to his creations for countless other
   consoles. The NES / Famicom Everdrive features a microSD card slot for
   loading ROMs from. As the Nintendo NES and Famicom use different types
   of cartridges, two versions of this device are available.
     * Storage: SD Cards
     * Pros: Good compatibility, save state functionality, can run Famicom
       Disk System games
     * Cons: None

Powerpak

   The Powerpak is a Nintendo NES flash cartridge created by RetroZone.
   The cartridge reads Nintendo NES ROMs off a CompactFlash card. While
   not all games are currently compatible with the device, updates are
   often released to support more complicated mappers.
     * Storage: CompactFlash Cards
     * Pros: Only the currently available Nintendo NES flash cartridge to
       date
     * Cons: The device is very fussy as to which CompactFlash cards will
       work with it

Super Nintendo (SNES) Flash Cartridges

   Super-NES-Flash-Cartridges

SD2SNES

   Although it might be the most expensive flash card on the market, the
   SD2SNES is by far the most feature packed device available to date. The
   SD2SNES is the only Super Nintendo flash cartridge which has the
   ability to play all the custom chip based games released back in the
   day - and much more. While the firmware update is yet to arrive, as it
   stands this will be the only flash cartridge out there capable of
   running Super FX games like Star Fox and Stunt Race FX.

   The custom homemade MSU1 chip is also supported on the SD2SNES, which
   allows CD quality audio and full motion video playback on the Super
   Nintendo without any additional modification or hardware required. This
   introduces all new games to the Super Nintendo such as a homebrew port
   of the Laserdisc classic Road Avenger, and updates to games such as
   Zelda: A Link To The Past with orchestral soundtracks.

   If it’s a Super Nintendo flash card you’re after and price is no
   concern, then look no further than the SD2SNES.
     * Storage: SD Cards
     * Pros: Insanely good compatibility, exclusive features, MSU1
       functionality
     * Cons: Very expensive, firmware updates have been slow to arrive -
       Super FX functionality still in the works years later

   Link: Buy SD2SNES

   Link: Find SD2SNES on eBay
     __________________________________________________________________

Super Everdrive

   Krikzz’s Super Nintendo offering is most definitely one you don’t want
   to dismiss too quickly. Similar to his other flash cartridges, the
   Super Everdrive makes use of SD cards to access your library of Super
   Nintendo ROMs.

   While the Super Everdrive doesn’t have the same compatibility as the
   SD2SNES with special cartridge chips - meaning the likes of the Super
   FX games (e.g. Starfox) and other special chip based games will not
   work - it does offer support for the DSP1 based games such as Super
   Mario Kart and Pilotwings.

   It’s easy to use and has out of the box drag ‘n’ drop functionality.
   Perfect for someone looking for a bare bones basic, although powerful,
   Super Nintendo flash card.
     * Storage: SD Cards
     * Pros: Best priced Super Nintendo flash card available
     * Cons: No special chip support other than DSP-1

     __________________________________________________________________

Super UFO Pro 8

   The Super UFO Pro 8 was China’s answer to the Super Everdrive. Having
   once been the experts on playing Super Nintendo ROMs via other means
   (thanks to their outdated Floppy Disk based devices of the 90s), you’d
   really expect their experience with these products to shine through.

   Apart from the impressive, albeit flaky (read: doesn’t work with every
   game) addition of save states on the original hardware (pause a game
   anywhere, turn off the device, resume play another time at exactly the
   same point) and the ability to backup games and saves from retail
   cartridges, the rest of the device feels somewhat unfinished. Unlike
   the Super Everdrive, additional software is required on your PC, an
   original Super Nintendo cartridge needs to be connected above before
   any games will load, and file names over 8 characters are shortened in
   the ROM loading menu.

   A lot of talk, but no action.
     * Storage: SD cards
     * Pros: Save state functionality is great on the games it does work
       with
     * Cons: Horrible software requirement, awful menu system, unfulfilled
       promises

SNES Powerpak

   Given that the SNES Powerpak from the same team that brought you the
   NES Powerpak is twice the cost of other Super Nintendo flash cards,
   you’d expect a lot for your money. Sadly though the SNES Powerpak from
   RetroZone has been outclassed as of recent, but only due to the
   device’s growing age. Technology has moved on and the SNES Powerpak has
   not.

   While the device handles Super Nintendo ROMs just as well as most SNES
   flash cards, the main drawback of the SNES Powerpak is its on-board
   menu system and software. ROMs and folders appear on-screen in the
   order you placed them onto the CompactFlash card, instead of
   alphabetically - making navigation to the game you want to play
   challenge. The device also requires empty save files to be created on
   the device beforehand for any games which may have save game
   functionality. While RetroZone do offer a downloadable empty save file
   for use, it is somewhat a daunting task having to create additional
   files for every single game you might play on a device advertised as
   being ‘drag and drop’.

   On the plus side though, the SNES Powerpak does offers DSP-1
   compatibility allowing the likes of Super Mario Kart and Pilotwings to
   run flawlessly.
     * Storage: CompactFlash cards
     * Pros: Does the job fine after initial setup, DSP-1 compatibility
     * Cons: Clunky software, lack of built-in save file creation

NEO SNES / SFC Myth

   Neoflash are very proactive team of hardware developers that have
   brought countless solutions to ROM loading devices and import adapters
   over the years. Unfortunately though, their chance to fill a huge gap
   in the market with their NEO range of flash cartridges, was met by a
   huge mistake several years ago. Simply put, Neoflash’s intention was to
   create a family of flash cards that all relied on the same storage
   solution - their existing Game Boy Advance flash cards.

   Using clunky PC based software you’re supposed to load up your Super
   Nintendo ROMs onto the Game Boy Advance flash card, which would then
   plug into the top of the NEO SNES / SFC Myth cartridge. This also
   allowed you to use part of the cartridge for your Mega Drive ROMs (for
   use with the NEO MD Myth and NEO N64 Myth at the same time. While
   sounding great as an all-in-one solution on paper, the small capacity
   of these cartridges filled up pretty quick and you found yourself
   needing at least one card for each flash cartridge - which was
   expensive to say the least.

   Given it is the one of the most expensive Super Nintendo flash
   cartridge on offer, you’d be better investing a little more and getting
   the ultimate SD2SNES.
     * Storage: Neoflash Game Boy Advance Flash Cards
     * Pros: Great if you have the other NEO Myth cards, near perfect
       compatibility
     * Cons: Expensive, clunky, outdated

Super Flash Card 64M

   Before the days of SD card enabled flash cartridges, Tototek ruled the
   retro gaming world with their range of flash cartridges. These fabled
   devices featured enough space for four different games to be loaded
   onto the on-board memory, however, they had to be programmed on using a
   pre-historic parallel port - something that hasn’t been seen on PCs for
   a good decade.

Floppy Disk based Devices - Super Wild Card, Super Pro Fighter etc

   During the 90s, the Far East produced a plethora of devices which can
   only be described as primitive versions of the flash cartridges we use
   today. Most of these were large plug-in devices that featured an entire
   floppy disk drive within its casing. Game cartridges could be written
   onto floppy disk, with large games being split onto multiple disks.

   Needless to say these devices are a pain to use today, however, hold
   plenty of nostalgia and allure due to their colourful (and criminal)
   past.

Nintendo 64 Flash Cartridges

   Nintendo-64-Flash-Cards

Everdrive 64

   Yet again Krikzz has created one of the best solutions for getting our
   gaming fix on another system. The Everdrive 64 is his SD card enabled
   Nintendo 64 cartridge which features fantastic compatibility and an
   array of exclusive features.

   The Everdrive 64 features an all important CIC boot emulator that
   emulates the CIC-6102 and CIC-7101. If you’re unsure on what this is,
   simply put it now brings the Everdrive 64 near perfect compatibility
   with every single game including even the more advanced N64 games such
   as Banjo Tooie.

   As various Nintendo 64 games had their own different type of built in
   save game functionality (for example, SRAM, SRAM128Kbyte, EEPROM16k,
   EEPROM4k, FlashRam), the Everdrive 64 has been programmed to support
   all of these. The Everdrive 64 usually detects what type of save memory
   is required per ROM, however, with this much power comes responsibility
   - and the only downside to this device. After playing through a game
   and saving your progress, you must hit reset before powering off the
   console and allow the Everdrive 64 enough time to write your save data
   to the SD card. This has since been fixed in the newer third version of
   the cartridge, but at an added cost.

   Also on board the Everdrive 64 is the unusual addition of emulator
   functionality. The Everdrive 64 has the ability to emulate Nintendo NES
   and Nintendo Game Boy games straight from the SD card via the Everdrive
   64 menu. Additional files are required for this, but they’re only a few
   clicks away.

   The main thing to keep in mind when purchasing an Everdrive 64 is which
   region console you will be playing it on. The PAL Nintendo 64 will
   require the CIC-7101 version, where by the NTSC will require the
   CIC-6102 version.
     * Storage: SD cards
     * Pros: Amazing compatibility, emulation features, gamepak save
       support.
     * Cons: Cannot use the same cartridge on both a PAL and NTSC Nintendo
       64, fiddly save game functionality

Retroactive 64drive

   At twice the price of the Everdrive 64, the 64drive doesn’t seem to
   offer enough to justify such a hike in price, unless you’re a homebrew
   developer.

   Where it differs from the Everdrive 64 is its combination of a
   CompactFlash and MicroSD card slot, allowing up to a maximum of 160gb
   of storage space. Given that the entire Nintendo 64 ROM set will only
   take up a fraction of this available space, there is little reason to
   even think about investing in such a large memory card for use on the
   64drive.

   Clearly created with homebrew developers in mind (fast USB connectivity
   and large storage space), those more interested in the gaming side of
   flash cards should look towards the cheaper option.
     * Storage: MicroSD and CompactFlash cards
     * Pros: Great compatibility, save game writing, storage space
       potential
     * Cons: Very expensive

   Link: Buy 64drive
     __________________________________________________________________

Neo Myth 64

   Similar to the NEO SNES / SFC Myth above, Neoflash’s Nintendo 64
   solution also relies on the same storage solution - Game Boy Advance
   flash cards. Given there are much simpler alternatives on offer for the
   same price or cheaper, avoid this outdated and overpriced solution.
     * Storage: Game Boy Advance Flash Cards
     * Pros: None
     * Cons: Outdated, overpriced, requires other Neoflash hardware to run

   Link: Buy NEO 64 Myth
     __________________________________________________________________

Doctor V64, Doctor V64 Jr and other dated discontinued devices

   There are several other flash card alternatives for the Nintendo 64
   which still offer just as much functionality as those above. While they
   do work a treat, the likes of the Doctor V64, Doctor V64 Jr, C64 and
   Z64 are outdated due to the primitive forms of media they rely on - Zip
   disks, CDs, parallel port transfers. Some of these, however, can be
   modified to run games from hard drives and/or CompactFlash cards, but
   the hassle usually isn’t worth it given the other options available
   requiring no modification whatsoever.

Nintendo Game Boy / Game Boy Color Flash Cartridges

   Game-Boy-and-Color-Flash-Carts

Everdrive GB

   Yet again Krikzz has arrived on the scene and created something
   incredible. The Everdrive GB, as it stands, is the definitive solution
   to enjoying Game Boy games on the go, thanks to the many features seen
   in his other flash cartridges. Allowing you to insert a MicroSD Card
   into the device, you’ll be able to store the entire library of Game Boy
   and Game Boy Color games on a single cartridge. Each and every game
   played will create its own save file too, allowing you to pick up where
   you left off on the next boot up.

   And if that wasn’t enough already, the Everdrive GB is fully compatible
   with the Super Game Boy, allowing the chosen ROM files to display their
   colourful Super Nintendo borders too. This is then further enhanced by
   the addition of Game Genie code functionality too.
     * Storage: MicroSD Cards
     * Pros: Easy to use, Super Game Boy Compatibility, Unlimited Save
       Files
     * Cons: None

USB GB Smart Card 64M

   As of today the USB GB Smart Card 64M is looking rather dated. Using
   limited on-board memory space to store game ROMs, new alternatives
   which can read from removable storage media have since arrived. As it
   stands, on average you can fit around 20 different Game Boy and Game
   Boy Color games onto the device - which can be uploaded via a USB
   cable.

   To make matters worse, the bundled software is rather flaky, and
   getting to the point where you can consider which games to write to it
   is tricky. The flash card’s drivers are incredibly fiddly to install
   and anyone running a 64-bit version of Windows is setting themselves up
   for a long and difficult journey. The other downside to the device
   though is its method of saving games. The USB GB Smart Card 64M uses
   the same battery back storage solution as seen on commercial Game Boy
   games, meaning it only has space for one save game. So if you planned
   to start out multiple Zelda adventures and Pokemon journeys on this
   single flash cartridge, you’re out of luck.
     * Storage: On-board memory (64Mbit)
     * Pros: Very cheap, USB based, menu driven
     * Cons: Awful software, driver installation is painful, only one save
       file at a time

     __________________________________________________________________

Drag ‘N Derp

   Removing the need for bundled software and horrific drivers, the Drag
   ‘N Derp does exactly what it says on the tin. Simply connect the
   cartridge to your PC with a USB cable, it will appear as a removable
   drive, drop the Game Boy ROM you want (and .SAV file) onto the device,
   disconnect and go play. Simple.

   Although offering the most straightforward and admirable form of
   writing ROMs to a Game Boy cartridge we’ve seen to date, the Drag ‘N
   Derp cartridge is limited to a single Game Boy ROM at any one time.

   If you don’t mind connecting up and loading different ROMs on each time
   you want to play then the Drag ‘N Derp is for you. Those wanting a
   larger selection of games for long journeys and convenience will need
   to look elsewhere.

GB X Changer, Doctor GB and other outdated Game Boy Flash Cartridges

   Game Boy piracy was a huge problem for Nintendo back in the 90s. Not
   only was the market flooded with bootleg games, but also countless
   flash cartridges and game copiers. The majority of these today still
   offer the same functionality as those from above, however, the means of
   getting software onto these devices once again requires the long lost
   parallel port and older operating systems.

   Nevertheless they’re an interesting curio for retro game collectors.

Nintendo Game Boy Advance Flash Cartridges

   Game-Boy-Advance-Rewritable-Cartridges

EZ-Flash IV

   Unfortunately, despite being a hugely popular handheld, the Game Boy
   Advance is yet to catch up with the rest of the gaming world when it
   comes to ‘modern’ flash cartridge solutions. The EZ-Flash IV is without
   the best cartridge on the market for the handheld, one equipped with a
   MicroSD Card slot, however, getting game ROMs to boot is a fiddly
   affair that leaves a lot to be desired.

   Instead of being able to simply drag and drop your games of choice onto
   a MicroSD Card, each and every game must be patched through EZ-Flash
   software in order to run on the device. The software in question will
   do the job just fine, however, once on the flash cartridge you’ll find
   the names of each game are taken from the ROM’s header, rather than the
   filename. This in turn means some game names are blank, some conflict
   with each other, and others can display in Japanese characters too.

   While we await a simple drag and drop solution, the EZ-Flash IV with
   its flaws is still the best Game Boy Advance flash cartridge around.
     * Storage: MicroSD Cards
     * Pros: Works with up to 32gb MicroSD Cards, Custom Menu Themes
     * Cons: Software needed to install games

Everdrive GBA

   Given Krikzz has created a fantastic solution for the majority of
   consoles and handhelds, you’ll be surprised to know that the Game Boy
   Advance is yet to receive its very own Everdrive. That said, don’t lose
   hope - since finishing his last product Krikzz has revealed he is
   currently working on something for the Game Boy Advance.

   More on this once it arrives!

Nintendo Virtual Boy Flash Cartridges

   Nintendo-Virtual-Boy-USB-Programable-Cartridge

FlashBoy Plus

   In 2007 the Nintendo Virtual Boy was finally given the flash card
   treatment it deserved. Richard Hutchinson released the FlashBoy
   cartridge, which was a reprogrammable Virtual Boy cartridge which
   featured enough space for a single game to be installed.

   Since then the FlashBoy has evolved into the FlashBoy Plus, a newer
   edition of the cartridge which features battery backed save
   functionality. Progress on games such as 3-D Tetris, Galactic Pinball,
   SD Gundam Dimension War, Teleroboxer, Virtual Boy Wario Land and
   Virtual Fishing could now be saved to the FlashBoy and restored on
   every use.

   Unfortunately though given that the device is being created
   sporadically by one individual, those hoping to get their hands on a
   Virtual Boy flash cartridge will need to keep a close eye on the
   FlashBoy forums. Any announcement of a new batch of FlashBoys will
   instantly be gobbled up by the ever prevalent and growing fan base for
   the Nintendo Virtual Boy. That said, they do appear on eBay from time
   to time...

   Nintendo Pokemon Mini Flash Cartridges

PokeCard 512 Rev2

   Believe it or not but the incredibly tiny Pokemon Mini handheld has
   been gifted a flash card for its incredibly small library of 10 games.
   The device known as the PokeCard was created by an enthusiast of the
   system, which has since been expanded to allow multiple game ROMs at
   once and programming of the cartridge via USB.

   Sadly though these cartridges are somewhat near impossible to secure as
   they are all made by hand by one Pokemon Mini fan. After announcing the
   arrival of these devices a few years back he has been inundated with
   requests for the cartridge, so much so that contacting him today for a
   device will probably go a miss.

Sega Master System Flash Cartridges

   Sega-Master-System-SD-Card-Cartridge

Master Everdrive

   Once again the Ukrainian mastermind Krikzz has provided an all-in-one
   solution to enjoying Master System ROMs on the original hardware. The
   Master Everdrive is compatible with just about every title from the
   Master System library, allowing games as big as 8MBit to be loaded into
   memory.

   Further adding to the features, the Master Everdrive can also boot up
   SG-1000 games on the Master System too, however, it is not compatible
   with SC-3000 ROMs. The only downside to the Master Everdrive is that
   some of the more obscure Korean ROMs struggle to load. Regardless, this
   is still the ultimate - and only - answer to flash cartridges on the
   Master System.
     * Storage: SD Cards
     * Pros: Compatible with nearly all games, SG-1000 functionality,
       works on Game Gear too with adapter
     * Cons: Some Korean games are incompatible

Sega Mega Drive / Mega Drive 32X Flash Cartridges

   Mega-Drive-Flash-Cards

Everdrive MD

   Krikzz’s very first entry into the world of flash cartridges was the
   Everdrive MD. Built from the ground up for his favourite console, the
   Everdrive MD was a fantastic solution to enjoying the Mega Drive
   library on a single cartridge. This is made even better by the fact
   that the Everdrive MD can also boot up Master System and 32X games on
   the Mega Drive. Furthermore, the Everdrive MD is also capable of
   temporarily changing the BIOS on your Mega CD, allowing you to load
   imported game discs with ease.

   Over time the device has had a number of firmware updates and further
   compatibility improvements (EA games and others), however, in terms of
   pure power there’s a newer alternative that eclipses it - the Mega
   Everdrive. That said if all you’re looking for is a quick and cheap way
   of accessing a wealth of Mega Drive games from one place, the Everdrive
   MD is for you.
     * Storage: SD Cards
     * Pros: Compatible with nearly all games, Master System & 32X ROM
       functionality, Sega CD BIOS Options, Game Genie Cheat Codes
     * Cons: Slow ROM loading in comparison with the Mega Everdrive

Mega Everdrive

   As mentioned previously, flash cartridge maestro Krikzz has a fond
   place in his heart for the Sega Mega Drive. This is in turn saw the
   hardware tinkerer return to the 16-bit console to create an even more
   powerful flash cartridge that’s yet to be bettered.

   The Mega Everdrive does everything the Everdrive MD can do, along with
   plenty more thanks to its overpowered (for the job) FPGA chip. Simply
   put, the prior 7MBit ROM size limit has been increased to 16MBit, games
   load within a second or two, save state functionality is introduced
   too, and the cartridge can be used as Mega CD Backup RAM cart too.

   It might be a bit more expensive, but the Mega Everdrive is all you’ll
   ever need when it comes to 16-bit Sega flash cartridges.
     * Storage: SD Cards
     * Pros: Compatible with nearly all games, Master System & 32X ROM
       functionality, Sega CD BIOS Options, Game Genie Cheat Codes, Sega
       CD Backup RAM functionality, Save States, Quick Loading
     * Cons: None

NEO Myth MD 3in1

   Similar to the other Neoflash cartridges above, their Mega Drive
   solution also relies on the same storage solution - Game Boy Advance
   flash cards. While its dated storage solution leaves a lot to be
   desired, this is the only flash cartridge on the market that comes
   equipped with a YM2413 FM chip - allowing Master System ROMs to be
   played with FM Sound.

   Unless the added music channel tempts you, avoid this outdated and
   overpriced solution.
     * Storage: Game Boy Advance Flash Cards
     * Pros: Sega Master System FM Sound Functionality, 32X Compatibility
     * Cons: Outdated, overpriced, requires other Neoflash hardware to run

Sega Saturn Optical Drive Replacements

Rhea

   This oddly named hardware add-on for the Sega Saturn is set to make
   your discs obsolete. This credit card sized device completely replaces
   the console’s disc drive, and sends the information from game discs
   into the console’s memory. This in turn allows you to store a wide
   selection of games within the console, all of which load even faster
   from SD card.

   While it does require some additional installation, and a small
   modification depending on which version motherboard your Saturn has,
   you’ll be hard pressed to find anything better. The creator of this
   device has also created a disc drive emulator for the Sega Dreamcast
   too which is as equally as impressive.

   Obtaining the Rhea, however, is a bit of a challenge. The creator is
   often flooded with requests for the device and often sold out. That
   said, keep an eye on the official website for further updates.
     * Storage: SD Cards
     * Pros: Perfect Compatibility, Fast Loading
     * Cons: Requires installation by opening up your console, no built-in
       menu software

Saroo

   Around the same time the Rhea was announced, China also had an answer
   to loading backups of Sega Saturn games. Unlike the Rhea, the Saroo is
   a cartridge which slots into the back of the console - requiring no
   installation or modification.

   As good as this sounds, the team behind the device have been missing in
   action since late 2014. Whether or not the device was discontinued or
   ever finished remains to be known.

Sega Dreamcast Optical Drive Replacements & Adapters

   Sega-Dreamcast-Optical-Disc-Drive-Replacement

GDEmu

   As mentioned above, the GDEmu is the equivalent to the Sega Saturn’s
   Rhea - a complete replacement for the Sega Dreamcast’s disc drive which
   can boot games from SD card. By simply opening up the console,
   disconnecting the disc drive and connecting the GDEmu to the orphaned
   cable, you’ll be able to access a wealth of classics without a disc in
   sight.

   Out of the box the GDEmu’s approach to selecting which game you want to
   play is rather archaic. Games need to be placed on the SD card in
   individual folders named as numbers. By default the device will load
   the first numbered folder, and in order to move on to the next a button
   needs to be pressed on the GDEmu.

   This fiddly approach has since been addressed with some homebrew
   software known as GDmenu. By placing this package as the first game in
   folder number one, a menu driven interface will appear on screen each
   time you boot the console - allowing you to choose any game from the
   list without needing to touch the device.

   Once equipped with the correct software, there’s nothing that can rival
   the GDEmu. Having said that though, like the Rhea the creator is often
   inundated with requests for the device and more than likely sold out.
   Visit the official website often and you may be in luck.
     * Storage: SD Cards
     * Pros: Perfect Compatibility, Fast Loading
     * Cons: Requires installation by opening up your console, no built-in
       menu software

Dreamcast SD Card Adapter

   Before the GDEmu arrived on the scene, homebrew developers devised a
   way to load software onto the Sega Dreamcast using the serial port on
   the back. Although a breakthrough at the time, the serial port suffers
   from a very slow transfer rate and incompatibility issues. This is turn
   saw games needing to be modified, stripped of content, and patched to
   run from SD card via the device.

   While this may be a good cheap alternative to the GDEmu, you do get
   what you pay for. As of late the SD card adapter has been rather tricky
   to locate, with the few still out there often appearing for sale via
   eBay.

     * Pros: Cheap

Dreamcast IDE Modification

   If you’re low on funds, skilled with a soldering iron, and desperate to
   play Dreamcast games then read on. There is an incredibly complicated
   and tricky method for attaching hard drives to the console by soldering
   a female IDE connector to the console’s motherboard.

   Given the difficulty and damage that can be done to your Dreamcast, we
   recommend going for one of the alternatives above. If you’re curious
   though, guides online explain the method rather well with what appears
   to be decent results.

C4CPC

   Although the Amstrad GX4000 is often ignored for its low sales figures,
   poor design and lacklustre library, fans have since fought back and
   made the system relevant. The newly released C4CPC flash cartridge not
   only gives retro gamers the ability to play all the GX4000 games from
   flash cartridge, but converted Amstrad CPC games too.

   While the selection of converted Amstrad CPC games is limited to what’s
   been patched by the community, new releases are arriving every day and
   making this a surefire way to enjoying the micro-computer without
   needing to unpack the keyboard-long system and accompanying monitor.

   The C4CPC can be ordered through the CPCWiki forums. It’s worth noting
   too that it is highly recommended that you invest in a new power supply
   for your system if using the C4CPC. The one supplied for the console
   does not provide enough juice to both the flash cartridge and console,
   which has supposedly damaged some systems. Full details can be found
   within the device’s CPCWiki page.
     * Storage: MicroSD Cards
     * Pros: Fantastic compatibility, can run patched Amstrad CPC games
     * Cons: Bare board cartridge due to the small size of hucards

   Fans of Atari’s early gaming console will be pleased to know there’s an
   all-in-one solution at the ready. The recently revised Harmony
   cartridge is capable of playing just about every Atari 2600 game ever
   made.

   The only thing to note with the Harmony cartridge is that you’ll not
   only need to flash firmware that matches your console’s region, but
   also ensure that your game ROMs match too. This can be rather tricky
   for PAL gamers, as locating the correct ROM files can be a pain.

   Cartridge 16 in 1 can be written to with a USB linker, with space for
   up to sixteen different games. Although limited, there doesn’t seem to
   be any other Atari Lynx flash cartridge available elsewhere.

   The most quirky aspect to this device is that the games have to be
   selected through twisting a dial on flash cartridge itself. An added
   bonus of the kit too is that the same creator has made Watara /
   Quickshot Supervision and Vectrex cartridges too, meaning you only need

   Over in the depths of Russia is an incredibly talented individual that
   refuses to let the Panasonic 3DO die out. Similar to the likes of the
   Dreamcast’s GDEmu, the Panasonic 3DO now has a USB stick driven
   alternative to the on-board disc drive.

   Coming in a wide range of flavours for the different Panasonic 3DO
   systems out there, the Panasonic 3DO USB Host allows gamers to plug in
   any USB memory stick to the console to read games directly from. The
   USB Host emulates the 3DO’s disc drive perfectly, providing 100%
   perfect compatibility with every single game ever released for the
   multimedia platform.

   As great as this is, the range of devices available are very expensive
   and difficult to source. Some of them require advanced installations
   (removing chips from the console’s motherboard), while others are
   solderless plug-and-play solutions. Either way, you’ll need to do some

   linker - a rewritable flash cartridge with its own USB writer.

   Unfortunately the creator behind this device recently discontinued the
   cartridge linker, meaning those wanting to pick one up will need to
   look for secondhand units. That said it was discontinued for a good

Multiple Home Computers via Disk Drive Emulation

   Several decades ago floppy disks were the standard format for games on
   home computers. As time has gone on, the floppy disk format has not
   only been faced with degradation, but also becoming nothing more than
   the ‘save icon’ with today’s generation. Nevertheless modern
   alternatives which mimic real disk drives are now available.

   The incredibly versatile and oddly named HxC2001 is a direct
   replacement for just about any floppy disk drive. By simply hijacking a
   system’s floppy disk cable, the device can pretend to be a connected
   disk drive loading floppy images from SD card. The device also have a
   built-in display to show which image is currently present in memory,
   along with hardware buttons to switch between what’s available.

   With a wide range of compatible computers and devices (and musical

Gotek USB Floppy Emulator

   Similar to the HxC2001, the Gotek USB Floppy Emulator is a direct
   replacement for floppy disk drives. While it may not have the same
   support or confirmed cross-system compatibility as the HxC2001, it has
   since become a strong choice for Commodore Amiga owners following its
   recent firmware release.

   There doesn’t seem to be an official website for the Gotek USB Floppy
   Emulator, however further information is dotted around various blogs.
   With this in mind too, it seems that the best place to get the device
   from is eBay.
     * Storage: USB Memory Sticks
     * Pros: Slim design fits into an Amiga perfectly
     * Cons: Same load times as a floppy disk, lacks the support the
       HxC2001 has

   This is a great guide, thanks for taking the time to create it.

   You listed some pretty obscure ones I had no idea about even. I will
   reference this page for years to come when building up my retro system
   collection!
   You did miss one of the ODE's for the Dreamcast though, and that was
   the USB-GDrom Controller. I am sure it must have just been a mistake as
   your site has posted about them before in the past. Anyways thanks for
   the extremely detailed write up!

   Edit: Also there is a MUCH cheaper place that sells the SD adapters for
   the Dreamcast. The ones on eBay all want $30-$40 for them and charge a
   lot for shipping on top of that price.
   The one here is only $14.

   Hey there,
   you should include the DSTWO plus which features GBA, SNES, DS and even
   3DS games...

   This is still a great guide, but should probably be updated to include
   the new Ez-Flash GBA carts as well as the Everdrive GBA line.

Hardware Review: Everdrive GBA X5 (Game Boy Advance) Flash Cartridge

   20 August 2016 Cauterize Reviews - Hardware

   Everdrive-GBA-X5-Review In what could be described as the most
   anticipated arrival from Krikzz’s retro gaming headquarters, the
   Ukrainian mastermind has finally released an Everdrive flash cartridge
   for the Game Boy Advance. Simply dubbed the Everdrive GBA X5, this
   modern solution for Nintendo’s 2001 handheld enters a slightly crowded
   market with the aim of coming out on top.

   For those unfamiliar with the other options available, the Nintendo
   Game Boy Advance saw a flurry of backup devices hitting the platform
   just mere years into its release. Many of these came during the slow
   transition which home computing took towards adopting the USB standard,
   and of course the growing popularity of memory cards. This in turn saw
   several Game Boy Advance flash cartridges bundled with parallel port
   writers, whilst the newer options began to utilise writing on the fly
   via a USB cable.

   As promising as this progress was for gamers, the general experience
   was somewhat lacking when it came to playing Game Boy Advance ROMs on
   flash cartridges. If it wasn’t the unreliable parallel port
   connectivity causing issues, the proprietary software needed to either
   write ROMs or patch them to run was incredibly cumbersome. Even the
   later cards which made use of removable media also suffered from
   mandatory software causing issues, which all in all meant there wasn’t
   a simple drag-and-drop solution available.

   Despite these frustrations, these dated flash cartridges still managed
   to play the majority of hits from the Game Boy Advance’s catalogue. The
   trouble if anything arose once you decided to reshuffle your choice of
   installed ROMs - especially given storage came at a premium in the
   early 2000s.

   Fast forward to today though, MicroSD cards are now pushing 128gb in
   capacity, and you’d like to think that the days of being selective with
   which ROMs to install are over. This is where the Everdrive GBA X5
   comes in.

Introducing the Everdrive GBA X5

   Originally revealed in October 2014, Krikzz’s announcement that a Game
   Boy Advance flash cartridge was in development was met with an excited
   response worldwide. While development on the device may have been
   taking its time, the small snippets of news which arose out of Ukraine
   continued to promise just about every feature fans of the handheld
   wanted. This included support for simplistic drag-and-drop of game ROMs
   onto an MicroSD card (without the need of patching or software), a Real
   Time Clock for use in Pokemon games, near 100% compatibility with the
   Game Boy Advance library, and support for the Gamecube Game Boy Player
   too. Following the sporadic updates which trickled out, the Everdrive
   GBA X5 was finally made available to pre-order in early July 2016 with
   those lucky enough to secure one receiving their cartridge around mid
   to late August.

   Even prior to a purchase the first thing most have noticed about this
   new device is the shape of the cartridge. Instead of finding itself in
   a similar sized case to the standard Game Boy Advance cartridges, the
   Everdrive GBA X5’s form is more akin to the likes of the unique Drill
   Dozer and Yoshi's Universal Gravitation game carts. Once slotted in for
   play the cartridge’s shell sticks out of the handheld with both the
   MicroSD card slot and the on-board battery visible through the
   translucent case. While perhaps not as flush or tidy as the prior
   Everdrive GB or Everdrive GG cartridges, this small protrusion is
   purely cosmetic and doesn’t get in the way of the action.

   Everdrive-GBA-Cartridge-Size

Temporary MicroSD Card Mayhem

   With the visual side of things out of the way, we spent the next thirty
   minutes loading up a range of classics onto a 32gb MicroSD card. From
   Advance Wars to Wario Land 4, our standout choices were also coupled
   with the all important BIOS/menu files too. Unfortunately for us
   though, booting up the device for the first time presented an error
   message on screen. Reading ‘SD IO Error’ and refusing to show the game
   selection menu, we went back to the drawing board and tried formatting
   the MicroSD card and starting again. Frustratingly we were once again
   shown the error code. At this point in time we made the assumption that
   the device might not be able to handle storage as spacious as 32gb. We
   changed over to a 8gb MicroSD card and then found the exact same
   problem present once more.

   Krikzz’s products (as many in the retro gaming world will tell you) are
   second to none. The constant sight of an error message was somewhat
   unfamiliar territory, and a little worrying. As a last resort we
   switched over to a 1gb MicroSD card that’s been sat in a box of spares
   and left unused for years. Much to our surprise the Everdrive GBA X5’s
   built in menu system showcasing our selection of ROMs appeared on
   screen.

   Having finally stuck gold we decided to do some research on why the
   promise of compatibility with up to 32gb MicroSD cards wasn’t being
   held up. Looking over the discussion forums on Krikzz’s official
   website we soon found a whole host of other users suffering the same
   fate. As it stands reports suggest that the Everdrive GBA X5 struggles
   to work with MicroSD cards that exceed a Speed Class rating of 4. This
   means you’ll need to be selective in what MicroSD cards your purchase
   for use in the device at this point in time. Krikzz has since stated
   that a firmware upgrade to fix this issue will be released in the near
   future.

   The only other point worth mentioning with the MicroSD cards is that
   the Everdrive GBA X5 firmware doesn’t automatically sort ROMs
   alphabetically. As a result the game selection menu will appear
   somewhat random, when in reality it’s sorted by the order the games are
   placed onto the MicroSD card. The two ways around this are to carefully
   place ROMs on in order, or instead use software such as DriveSort to
   put them back in order once done.

   Everdrive-GBA-X5-in-a-GBA-SP

Gaming on the Everdrive GBA X5

   Starting out with Advance Wars, the late 2001 war strategy game was
   chosen from the menu and running within seconds. Everything was on show
   as we remembered with the anime styled introduction playing out. As far
   as the Game Boy Advance could tell, a legitimate copy of Advance Wars
   was in the sat in cartridge slot occupied by the Everdrive GBA X5.

   Having played the first few missions of the game, we saved our progress
   and shutdown the handheld. Before moving on to another classic, we
   booted Advance Wars up again to ensure that the save functionality was
   working correctly. As you’d expect our progress was waiting to be
   resumed from where we left off. The only thing worth mentioning with
   how the Everdrive GBA X5 handles save games is the unusual way it
   stores them on the MicroSD card. Instead of using a single file format
   for saves, the Everdrive GBA X5 gives each type of save a different
   file extension. For example we have .SRM for SRAM, .EEP for EEPROM, and
   .FLA for Flash Memory. Although anything but a problem, it does mean
   that anyone wanting to copy over existing save games from emulators or
   other backups will need to not only work out what save type their game
   uses, but also rename its file extension to match up.

   On that note we decided to putting an existing save backup from Mario
   Kart Super Circuit onto the MicroSD card. By making use of the free
   software GBA Tool Advance we were able to determine that game uses
   Flash Memory for its saves, and thus we renamed our save file’s
   extension to .FLA and copied into the GBASYS/SAVE folder on the MicroSD
   card. It’s important to note here that the name of the save file must
   match that of the ROM it belongs to. Upon loading up Mario Kart Super
   Circuit the save file was instantly detected. The warm orange glow of
   the sky on the title screen of Mario Kart Super Circuit was visible - a
   sight only seen once you’ve beaten the game.

   Pressing on we tested a wide range of games including Castlevania
   Circle of the Moon, Road Trip Shifting Gears, Kururin Paradise and
   F-Zero Climax. Each and every game we selected was running like a
   dream. In an attempt to push the device further we selected the Kingdom
   Hearts Chain of Memories ROM which weighs in at a massive 256MBit.
   Needless to say Square Enix’s fantastic 2004 portable adventure was in
   action and awaiting our input.

   Elsewhere the Real Time Clock functioned exactly as expected. Within
   Pokemon Sapphire the protagonist’s bedroom clock correctly matched the
   actual time of the day, and we can only assume that the time-based
   events including evolutions would work too.

   Everdrive-X5-Menu

   Last but not least our final attempt to trip up the Everdrive GBA X5 up
   was with fan translation patches and trainers. As the Everdrive GBA X5
   is currently lacking support for Pro Action Replay or Gameshark codes,
   we opted to patch several games with (cheat) trainers that can be found
   dotted around the net. These little patches add a small screen before
   the game loads that allows you to toggle infinite lives or weapons,
   similar to the many found in cracktros in the home computing scene of
   the 1980s. Our tests soon saw F-Zero Maximum Velocity’s trainer tearing
   apart the game with instant full speed buttons and unlimited boosts on
   offer. The Everdrive GBA X5 once again showed no form of slowing down.

   On the fan translation side of things, we did hit a few hiccups but
   these aren’t faults with Krikzz’s creation. Having enjoyed what we saw
   of Kururin Paradise previously we patched the game ROM with the fan
   translation available at ROMHacking.net. Sadly this brought around a
   whole host of graphical and audio glitches, making the game unplayable.
   This is down to the method of translation/patching used here,
   presumably intended to be compatible with emulators instead of the
   actual handheld. Elsewhere the recently released Magical Vacation
   English language patch ran like a dream, with Brownie Brown’s Japanese
   exclusive adventure finally playable on the original hardware.

Conclusion

   As you may have already noticed we’ve been blown away with the
   Everdrive GBA X5. For years now the Game Boy Advance has needed a fuss
   free flash cartridge that doesn’t rely on software coded for Windows XP
   or older operating systems. While the Everdrive GBA X5’s problems with
   specific MicroSD cards may be problematic, it’s a temporary hiccup
   which will soon be resolved through a firmware update.

   Simply put, there is no other Game Boy Advance flash cartridge out
   there that’s capable of containing the entire library within -
   nevermind offering what appears to be perfect compatibility and quick
   ROM loading. Costing £94.99 from Retro Towers, it’s a worthy investment
   given just a handful of retail releases could cost you that today.

   Hey John,
   You're in for a treat - it's a great game from what we've played so
   far. Unfortunately we can't link you directly to ROMs to download, but
   if you're wanting to play the translated version here's what you will
   need to do:
   1) Download LunarIPS for PC
   2) Download the Magical Vacation fan translation
   (http://www.romhacking.net/translations/2662/)
   3) Patch the ROM using LunarIPS
   4) Play!
   Nice and easy!
