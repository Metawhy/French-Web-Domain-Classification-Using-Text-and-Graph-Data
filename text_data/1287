The True Blue Scouts of Sugar Man Swamp by Kathi Appelt

   You guys. I just read the most whack-a-do book in the entire world and
   I loved everything about it.
   [q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=1442421053&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;ID=AsinIma
   ge&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=inth

   So you've got two raccoon brothers, out on their own for the first time
   as sworn protectors and early warning detectors for the Sugar Man
   Swamp. They live in the rusted out shell of an old car with a radio
   that only works when lightening strikes and spend their nights
   (raccoons are nocturnal, duh) trying to figure out exactly what being a
   scout means. A few miles out of the swamp is Chap, a 12 year old boy
   who learned to love the swamp from his grandfather and now needs a
   literal boat full of cash to save his mother's bakery from a greedy
   land developer.
   Then there's Sonny, said greedy land developer who, with a world renown
   alligator wrestler, wants to pave over the entire swamp and turn it
   into an alligator wrestling theme park. Out in Louisiana, and making
   their way towards the Sugar Man Swamp as fast as they can (rumble,
   rumble, rumble) is a pack of the biggest, meanest, most wild, wild hogs
   the world has ever seen. They've heard rumors of the sweet cane break
   sugar that gives the swamp it's name and they'll stop at nothing
   (except the occasional mud hold) to gobble it all up.
   And of course there's the Sugar Man himself, the living breathing
   embodiment of the swamp. A great mythical creature, a distant relative
   of the Yeti. Sugar Man is old and tired though, and he's been asleep
   for 40 years, curled up deep in the swamp with his rattlesnake best
   friend, secure in the knowledge that his scouts will warn him of any
   potential danger.
   As all of these forces converge on the swamp, Appelt deftly weaves
   their separate plot lines into a charming and deceptively simple folk
   tale. It was announced yesterday that The True Blue Scouts of Sugar Man
   Swamp is on the long list for the National Book Award for Young
   People's Literature and I can't think of anything I've read this year
   that deserves to be on the list more. I've never read any of Kathi
   Appelt's previous books, but before I even finished True Blue I put
   them all on hold.

Theme Thursday: RED

   Themes are hard yo. Sometimes when nothing else is coming together you
   just have to say screw it and go with a color.
   Song: Good Morning Dear Earth
   Flannel: Little Mouse (he was hiding in the red house today)
   Flannel: Alphabet Soup- RED
   Flannel: Things that are Red
   In which I described flannel pieces from all sorts of different sets
   and had the kids guess what they were. Normally I'd try to come up with
   a cute couplet for each one, but for today please see the above note on
   saying "screw it"
   Book: The Red Hen by Rebecca Emberley
   [q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=1596434929&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;ID=AsinIma
   ge&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=inth
   echisroo-20]
    Song: Wheels on the Fire Truck
   Song: Mi Cuerpo from Hot Peas n' Butter's Best of the Bowl: Ingles y
   Espanol
   Flannel: 5 Little Apples
   Song: Itsy Bitsy Spider
   Book: Clifford the Big Red Dog from Clifford Collection by Norman
   Bridwell
   [q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0545450136&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;ID=AsinIma
   ge&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=inth
   echisroo-20]
    Funny story, I thought we didn't have any Clifford books for a while
   this morning because I always want to spell his name bIrdwell instead
   of bRidwell. Dyslexia strikes again!
   Song: Turn Around from Hap Palmer's
   Make and Take Craft: Red Collages
   [IMG_3719.jpg]
   Supplies:
   -glue sticks
   -red markers
   -red construction paper
   [IMG_3720.jpg] -red pipe cleaners
   -red tissue paper
   -red glitter glue
   Process: Cut the red paper and tissue paper into shapes. Give
   everything to the kids and let them go crazy. Some of the kids tried to
   make representative things like ladybugs or this itsy bitsy spider,
   others just had fun with glue sticks and tissue paper.
   Time: Prep took 3 minutes, the craft took 25.

Where in the World (Non-Fiction section) is Carmen San Diego (Melvil Dewey)

   IFRAME:
   https://www.youtube.com/embed/wdzyuJJZMCI?feature=player_embedded

   Okay, now that we've got that out of our systems...
   I've been wanting to do a scavenger hunt in the non-fiction section for
   a long time. I just wasn't sure how it was going to work. Then I saw
   Miss Ingrid's post on how her library does a Melvil Dewey scavenger
   hunt and I loved it so much that I stole it wholesale, right down to
   the smokin' hot picture of Dewey (seriously, what a fox) and the
   glitter accents.
   Ingrid (I read her blog enough that I feel like we're friends and
   totally on a first name basis) doesn't have prizes for her kids who
   play the Dewey game. Just the satisfaction of a job well done. Which I
   think is fantastic. BUT. We have so much [DEL: crap :DEL]  leftover
   summer reading prizes in our back room, including some Chipotle coupons
   that will expire at the end of the month, that I basically look for
   excuses to give kids stuff.
   I've also really been wanting to have a non-fiction party. Now that the
   Common Core is really a thing, I think there are so many cool
   applications for Ripley's Believe It or Not, hands on science
   experiments and crafts drawn from our non-fiction section.
   So with those two things in mind, I've tweaked Miss Ingrid's Melvil
   Hunt to fit our needs.
   [IMG_3731.jpg]
   "Today I'm in the 400s, books about languages"
   This is Melvil Dewey. He invented the Dewey Decimal system. Melvil
   hangs out on the easel on the back of the flannel board, near the
   children's desks on Saturdays. Each Saturday he hides in a different
   part of the non-fiction section, as indicated in his speech bubble.
   Anyone can come, check him out, grab one of the entry forms and a golf
   pencil, and head off to find good ol' Melvil.
   [IMG_3733.JPG]
   "Now see if you can find... How do you say hello in 3 languages?"
   When they find the smaller Melvil, he's asking more specific, yet still
   open ended question about the section that he's hiding in, encouraging
   the kids to look through some of the books. And since I "laminated"
   this picture with packing tape, we can use it like a dry erase board to
   write and re-write the weekly question. The piece of paper that they
   answer the question on serves as a raffle entry- so they can answer the
   question as many times and in as many different ways as they like- and
   at the end of the day we draw for a bunch of prizes.
   [IMG_3734.jpg]
   At the end of the semester we'll have a non-fiction party instead of a
   big to-do for the holidays. There will be trivia drawn from the cool
   facts that the kids supply us with through their answers, hands-on
   stations from featured Dewey sections (like an animal print identifying
   table! I just got really excited about that possibility, please excuse
   excessive use of exclamation marks) and the usual snacks and goodies
   that accompany a party.
   In October our library system is going to extended hours, and in
   conjunction with that, we're being asked to plan programming for both
   Saturday and Sunday (as well as story time every day, but that's a
   different story for a different time). As most librarians know,
   programming on Saturday is a tricky beast in that no one comes. Ever.
   And I imagine Sundays are even worse, with all the pressure to do
   neglected homework before Monday. A low-key, drop-in program like this
   seems to be just the ticket to complying with administrative edicts
   while still maintaining our sanity.

Theme Thursday: Chugga Chugga Cho Chooooooooooooo

   And rounding out our impromptu transportation unit, stories about
   trains.
   Song: Good Morning Dear Earth
   Flannel: Little Snake
   Song: Open, Shut Them
   Flannel: Alphabet Soup- RED
   Book: Down by the Station by Will Hilldebrand
   [q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0152167900&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;ID=AsinIma
   ge&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=inth
   echisroo-20]
   Song: Wheels on the Bus
   Flannel: This Little Train
   Song: Shake Your Sillies Out from Raffi's The Singable Songs Collection
   (20th Anniversary Special Edition)
   Song: Grand Old Duke of York
   Song: Itsy Bitsy Spider
   Book: And the Train Goes... by William Bee
   [q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0763632481&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;ID=AsinIma

   Make and Take Craft: Train Engineer Hats
   [IMG_3669.jpg]
   Supplies:
   -construction paper
   -stapler
   -crayons/markers
   Process: Cut out a template for a train engineer hat. I just googled
   "train engineer hat" and copied what I saw on a full sheet of
   construction paper.  Color the hat as desired. Fold the hat at the brim
   line (where the sides of the hat start in pinch in) staple a long strip
   on construction paper to each side on the back and wear like a visor!
   Time: Prep took about 10 minutes and the craft took about 15.

Kiki Strike: Inside the Shadow City by Kristen Miller

   [q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=1599909200&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;ID=AsinIma
   ge&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=inth
   echisroo-20]

     Kiki Strike: Inside the Shadow City
    I want you to close your eyes for a minute and picture this:
   Imagine that it's early on a Saturday morning, so early that no one
   else is awake and you're not sure why you're awake either. As you go to
   the kitchen for a glass of water you happen to glance out the window
   and you see it. A great, big, giant hole. I'm talking swallowed the
   side walk and a couple of park benches, glad there wasn't a house there
   because it would be GONE sized hole. There's no one outside, no caution
   tape around the hole, no workers trying to fill it in. You may be the
   very first person who has ever seen this gigantic hole. Until. Out of
   the corner of your eye you see a small girl, a child really, sneak up
   to the edge of the hole, look around like she's trying to figure out if
   she's being watched, and then jump in.
   What do you do? Do you go get your water and come back to bed? Maybe
   try to find a Saturday morning cartoon? Do you wake up your parents or
   call the police? Or do you sneak back to your room, pull on some
   clothes and follow that girl down the hole to see what you can find?
   That's the choice that Ananka Fishbein is faced with in the first few
   chapters of Kiki Strike: Inside the Shadow City . And since the book
   last longer than those first couple chapters I'm sure you can guess
   what her decision was. But it's what follows that's truly amazing.
   Read Kiki Strike: Inside the Shadow City to discover what Ananka finds
   inside the hole- including but not limited to millions of rats, secret
   tunnels, rooms full of treasure and plague and a band of delinquent
   girl scouts.

The End of the Season

   YOU GUYS! SUMMER READING IS OVER!
   We've handed out prizes, held raffles, stopped serving lunches and
   generally wrapped up shop. Most of the kids went back to school on
   Monday and for the first time in three months, we've been able to
   breathe.
   So how did summer reading go? Well, at our little branch summer reading
   completion was up over 300% from last year. 300%! Sign-ups were also
   much higher. I talked to a few parents and they attributed this to Ms.
   E and me pushing summer reading harder than ever before, and the prizes
   being better too. It's hard to argue with that, when for the first time
   ever there was a Chipotle coupon for half-way finishers and everyone
   got an actual prize- a book- when they completed the program, in
   addition to being entered into the raffle for a Kindle Fire.
   [michaella+003.JPG]
   Our finisher wall
   For the first time this year, we also had a separate program for the
   Read With Me crowd, ages birth to five.
   [michaella+002.JPG]
   Close up on the best ever way to spell "Dylan"
   This program also went a long way to pushing up our numbers. It made
   absolutely zero sense for an 18 month old to be held to the same
   standard of "reading" as a 10 year old and, I'm convinced, turned off a
   lot of parents from participating in past years.
   This year we had a game board with all sorts of activities promoting
   early literacy- we sang a song together, we talked about what we saw on
   a walk, we went to a library program, we practiced counting to 10
   etc...
   Putting these sorts of things in an early literacy summer reading
   program not only legitimized/validated what a lot of parents are
   already doing with their child, it gave us a great way to talk more
   about the six components of early literacy and what programs at the
   library are focused on early literacy development.
   All that being said, I'm super looking forward to fall and what back to
   school season has to offer.
   Sayonora Summer Reading, see you next year!
