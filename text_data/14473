   FM 2012 is the eighteenth in a series of symposia organized by Formal
   Methods Europe, an independent association whose aim is to stimulate
   the use of, and research on, formal methods for software development.
   The symposia have been notably successful in bringing together
   innovators and practitioners in precise mathematical methods for
   software and systems development, industrial users, as well as
   researchers.
   The special theme of FM 2012 is Interdisciplinary Formal Methods, with
   a goal of highlighting the development and application of formal
   methods in connection with a variety of disciplines such as medicine,
   biology, human cognitive modeling, human automation interactions and
   aeronautics, among others. FM 2012 will be held at the Conservatoire
   National des Arts et Métiers (Le Cnam) in the center of Paris with the
   support of the Cnam Computer Science Department and the MeFoSyLoMa
   group (Méthodes Formelles pour les Systèmes Logiciels et Matériels).
   The symposium will also host several associated events: Industry day,
   Workshops, Tutorials, Doctoral Consortium and a Verification
   Competition.
