   Article first published May 2017, updated February 2019.

   Want an email that looks awesome and converts like crazy? We joined
   forces with the talented crew from Really Good Emails to take the
   guesswork out of designing an excellent email with this email design
   guide and checklist that‚Äôll make every email you send more awesome.

   In this guide, we‚Äôll cover email design best practices for all the
   different elements of your email campaigns and have a bonus checklist
   for you at the end. So let‚Äôs get to it.

Subject Line

   While not a traditional ‚Äúdesign element‚Äù your subject line is
   considered one of the most important factors in getting your email
   opened so your subscribers can see your sweet design so make it
   engaging, personal, and relevant. Remember, that overuse of CAPS and
   unnecessary punctuation, as well as some words, can trigger spam
   filters so respect your subscribers and don‚Äôt go there. Use these words
   instead.

   Topshop ‚Äì Email Subject Line
   Bonus: CoSchedule has an excellent Headline Analyzer that could also be
   applied to email subject lines.

Is longer better?

   When it comes to email subject lines longer isn‚Äôt necessarily better.
   It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that your subscribers use a variety of
   different browsers and email clients as well as mobile devices to
   consume your emails.

   According to data from Return Path, 65 characters seems to be a sweet
   spot for email subject lines, which is about 15 characters more than
   the average subject line. When subject lines are 61-70 characters long,
   they tend to get read. However, most email subject lines are between 41
   and 50 characters.

   Return Path ‚Äì Email Subject Line ‚Äì Length and Read Rate

What about symbols in subject lines?

   The saying ‚Äúa picture is worth a thousand words‚Äù may never be more true
   than when it comes to emoji. And emoji in email subject lines can have
   a major impact. Not only can they take the place of words, be
   attention-grabbing, and add a definite charm, they can increase your
   open rates. A report by Experian noted that fifty-six percent of brands
   using emoji in their email subject lines had a higher unique open rate.
   Consider us üëç.

   Campaign Monitor - emoji in subject lines

Things to keep in mind when using emoji in email

   If an emoji isn‚Äôt supported in the email client, the recipient may see
   a ‚òê character instead.

   Remember: Gmail has to have some extra special considerations when
   using emoji. You may notice in Gmail when you use emoji in the subject
   line the icon will look different in the inbox view and after the email
   has been opened. This is due to the inbox view using the Android
   version of the emoji, meanwhile, the opened email view uses Google‚Äôs
   own emoji style. While the emoji basically look the same, it‚Äôs still
   worth testing to make sure the same sentiment is expressed in both
   versions.

   In addition, for Inbox by Gmail, it‚Äôs currently not possible to insert
   emoticons in Inbox messages using the browser version.

Preheader

   Your preheader can be visible in the inbox preview and in the body of
   your email, or just in the preview pane if you want to save email real
   estate. Preheaders add valuable context to your subject line and can
   help your open rate. Keep it short (between 40-70 characters) and to
   the point. Use this space to help your customer know why the email is
   useful to them. Your subject line and preheader text should work
   together.

Personalization

   Emails with personalized subject lines are 26% more likely to be
   opened. Go beyond just using your subscriber‚Äôs name in the subject line
   and use other data you have to fuel super relevant messages.

   Experian ‚Äì Email Subject Line - Personalization

   Adding company name, last purchase, or other information helps you to
   personalize the email in the perfect way for each subscriber. But
   really good personalization involves more than just injecting a first
   name. Think about how you could completely change the email based on
   someone‚Äôs information.

   Stop thinking of emails as one-to-many and think about them as
   one-to-one‚Äîwhere each email is customized to each subscriber.

Humanization / Contextual Marketing

   A term that‚Äôs been getting popular is contextual marketing or
   humanization which focuses on making the email more of a 1-to-1
   engagement rather than a 1-to-many type email that‚Äôs one-size fits all.

   This leads to emails specifically tailored to the subscriber which will
   lead to higher engagement.

   Spotify is a great example with their year-end campaign showing each
   subscriber what their most listened songs were and where they ranked in
   their favorite artists‚Äô fan rankings (based on how many times they
   listened to their music).
   Spotify ‚Äì Humanization ‚Äì Email Marketing


   Making your email feel more ‚Äúhumananized‚Äù and like it was built for
   each subscriber has many benefits including increased engagement,
   better relationships with your subscribers, and even people getting
   excited to receive and open your email.

Dynamic Content

   For those wanting to get serious with personalization, you can also
   dynamically change entire sections of content within your email to make
   the entire campaign more relevant and more appealing to subscribers.

   A common use case for this would be showing menswear to your male
   subscribers while showing womenswear to female subscribers. Check out
   how Adidas did it in this email:

Email Layout

   Your email layout should help the viewer know what they should check
   out first, and where they can go from there. They should be able to
   scan the email quickly using a logical hierarchy with large headlines
   and images focusing the attention. Use layout to break up space and
   help create chunks of content.

Inverted Pyramid

   We‚Äôre big fans of the inverted pyramid model. It‚Äôs essentially a
   framework for structuring the elements of your email campaigns
   (headers, imagery, buttons, etc) so they work together to draw people
   in, deliver the key messages of your campaign and get them to
   click-through.

   InVision ‚Äì Email Design ‚Äì Inverted Pyramid

   By guiding a subscriber‚Äôs eye down the page to your CTA, you‚Äôll
   encourage them to click through to explore more of what you have to
   offer, resulting in better brand awareness, more web traffic, and
   ultimately more sales.

Zig-Zag

   Another effective design grid is an angular one with a zig-zag layout.

     According to the graphic designer, Mary Stribley, an ‚Äúangular layout
     is both enticing to look at as well as functional to order lots of
     information and imagery.‚Äù

   You can create these angles through using imagery or color blocking in
   order to guide the reader through each step of the email. This not only
   creates a visually pleasing layout, it also helps to simplify each
   section of the email so that it is easy to read.

One Column

   One column emails work great on desktop and mobile. These mobile first
   emails usually adapt to desktop and scale images. It helps consumers
   navigate the email without overwhelming them. The one column design
   makes it obvious what information is important and what you want a
   consumer to do next.
   Code School ‚Äì One Column Email Design

Email Width

   To ensure that your email renders well in every email client, we can
   push the envelope on our email widths to at least 640 pixels. At widths
   wider than 640px Gmail doesn‚Äôt show any background color that would
   appear in the margins at most reasonable browser sizes (you can see
   them if you stretch your browser to wider than 1200px). For our
   designs, 600px is usually the sweet spot.

   Plus, email clients don‚Äôt use the full width of your screen to display
   an email message. Some show ads or have navigation or a menu so there
   are limitations to the real estate on a screen.

Images

   When using images in your emails, it‚Äôs important to keep the following
   in mind:
     * Dimension ‚Äì most emails are 600-640px wide. However, to keep your
       image crisp on high-resolution displays, you need to make your
       image 2x the size (ie. 1200px) and use the image attributes and CSS
       to keep the image at the width you want.
     * File Size ‚Äì It‚Äôs easy to forget about file size in an email but you
       want to make sure your images are optimized. Especially since more
       than 50% of emails are opened on mobile devices. The bigger the
       email, the longer it‚Äôll take for mobile subscribers to view and
       thus create a negative experience with your email. Read more about
       best practices for image-heavy emails here.
     * Alt Text ‚Äì If your image doesn‚Äôt load or breaks somewhere along the
       sending process, Alt Text is the text that will display in its
       place. This is another area that many email marketers overlook. Add
       in helpful Alt Text that adds to your message in the case that your
       image doesn‚Äôt load. If your image has text on it, I usually write
       the overlaying text as the alt text. This way if the image doesn‚Äôt
       load, the text will still be read. Including ALT text also makes
       your email more accessible.
     * Use images that complement the email ‚Äì Your email should not be a
       bunch of images placed together. An image should add to the email
       and messaging‚Äînot be the messaging. A simple way to test this is to
       view your email with images turned off. Does the email still make
       sense? Is the message still clear? Our friends at Email Monks offer
       some solid advice on the optimal text to image ratio.
     * Stock Images ‚Äì Stock imagery can sometimes take your audience out
       of the messaging. Keep your images on brand and genuine. Take the
       time if you have the opportunity to create specific imagery for
       your email campaign! If not, use imagery from paid sites like
       stocksy.com or free sites like deathtothestockphoto.com. Here are a
       few more to check out.

Images and Alt Text

   Alt text is simply the alternative text displayed with an image. Think
   of it as the backup text that provides some context about what your
   image is, for those that have images blocked or turned off by default.
   Many marketers learn about alt text the hard way by forgetting to use
   it and suffering the consequences. Don‚Äôt be that person.

   As you can see from the example below, when images are blocked,
   subscribers see what looks like a broken image, or a red ‚ÄúX‚Äù. In this
   case, alt text indicates that there is an image and provided a little
   context about the image to encourage subscribers to ‚Äúturn on or enable‚Äù
   images in the email.

   pals at Litmus.

Web Fonts + Fallbacks

   When it comes to email marketing, it‚Äôs best practice to use web fonts
   wherever you can, however, it‚Äôs important to keep in mind, that not all
   email clients offer universal support for web fonts.

   Example: Uses @import + @fontface to bring in Clobber, Gotham Book,
   Gotham Medium, and Montserrat fonts.
   Lyft - web fonts for email

   Google Fonts is a great resource to add web fonts to your emails. We
   suggest using live text when possible for better legibility across
   devices and consistent brand experience from email to website to add
   web fonts to your emails.

@import

   @import url http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans

   Currently, the @import method is not supported in AOL using IE11 and
   Android 2.3.

<link>

   <link href=‚Äùhttp://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans‚Äù
   rel=‚Äùstylesheet‚Äù type=‚Äùtext/css‚Äù>‚Ä®‚Ä®The <link> method is fully supported
   among the email clients listed above. Web font services will provide
   you with the href value to use for your web font of choice. If you‚Äôre
   hosting your own web-font, you‚Äôll have to change the href value to
   where you‚Äôve hosted your web font.

@font-face

   <style type="text/css">‚Ä®@media screen {‚Ä®   @font-face{‚Ä®
   font-family:'Open Sans';‚Ä®       font-style:normal;‚Ä®
   font-weight:400;‚Ä®       src:local('Open Sans'), local('OpenSans'),
   url('http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/opensans/v10/cJZKeOuBrn4kERxqtaUH3bO3Ld
   cAZYWl9Si6vvxL-qU.woff') format('woff');‚Ä®   }‚Ä®}‚Ä®</style>‚Ä®‚Ä®

   Think of the @font-face method as a direct-to-the-source sort of method
   of importing your web fonts. It can be more reliable to import the web
   font directly from the source as you can choose which format of web
   font you want to import. Especially if you‚Äôre given a choice, which
   some web font suppliers do have.

   If web fonts are not supported there are fallback fonts that will be
   seen instead. When setting fallbacks, remember to use a ‚Äúweb safe
   font‚Äù. System fonts like Calibri are not always supported across all
   clients.

   Email Marketing - Safe Web Fonts

   Each email client also has a preferred or default font which users
   would see instead of your chosen web font. The three most popular
   desktop email clients have the following defaults:

   Apple Mail = Helvetica
   Gmail = Arial
   Microsoft Outlook = Times New Roman

   Outlook is a special case. If a webfont fails in Outlook, it ignores
   the fallback fonts and just decides to render everything in Times New
   Roman. If this happens, add this CSS to your email and you should be
   good to go.

   <!--[if mso]>
   <style type="text/css">
   body, table, td, p, li, a {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif
   !important;}
   </style>
   <![endif]-->

   Add other elements like p, li, a, etc. if you need to fix Outlook
   rendering Times New Roman on those elements too.

   guide here.

White Space

   White space is the blank area around your paragraphs, images, and call
   to action buttons.

   Adding ample white space around the elements in your email encourages
   click-throughs by separating them visually from other elements in your
   email and helping focus the reader‚Äôs attention on them at the right
   time. It can also increase the legibility of your email and improves
   the eyes‚Äô ability to follow the content. Use your best judgment to
   ensure your copy and CTA button are separated enough to stand out, but
   close to enough that your readers know they‚Äôre connected.

Mobile Optimization

   Email opens on mobile devices just keep increasing year after year. The
   latest stats are that over 68% of email opens occur on mobile. Making
   your emails mobile-friendly is easier than ever by:
     * Using a mobile-friendly template
     * Keep your subject line short
     * Use preheader text
     * Use minimal body copy
     * Use one clear and easy to click CTA button (According to a recent
       MIT study, the average size of an adult index finger is between
       1.6cm and 2 cm, which translates to between 45 x 45px and 57 x 57px
       on a mobile device.) Multiple CTAs can be confusing and lead to
       overwhelm, which you definitely want to avoid.
     * Increase the size of body copy if it‚Äôs small on desktop emails.
       (16px is a good size for mobile)
     * Make sure your images aren‚Äôt too small or hard to see when on
       mobile

Coding Mobile Emails

   If you are coding your emails, there are two approaches to mobile
   emails: responsive and hybrid.

Responsive

   Responsive uses media queries and CSS to override the existing styles
   when the email is viewed on a small display.

   @media screen and (max-width: 480px) {
   .responsive-table {
   display: block;
   width: 100% !important;
   }

   .responsive-image {
   height: auto;
   max-width: 100% !important;
   }
   }

Hybrid

   Hybrid gets a little more complex but relies on using a fluid layout
   that will shrink and grow with the size of the display. Plus, it
   doesn‚Äôt rely on media queries which can be a big bonus if you‚Äôre
   targeting email clients that don‚Äôt support media queries.

CTAs + Bulletproof Buttons

   An ideal CTA button has three main aspects that work together to create
   an effective conversion point for the reader:
     * Copy ‚Äì be specific and focus on the benefit
     * Design ‚Äì stands out, appropriately sized, has whitespace around it
     * Placement ‚Äì the ideal placement of the CTA button is relative to
       the complexity of the offer. If the offer is more complex, you may
       need more explanation copy before the CTA.

   It‚Äôs always good to have a couple different button types for different
   priorities in your email. For example, having an orange button with
   white text for your main CTAs and light gray buttons with dark text for
   secondary elements. However, it‚Äôs important to keep the number of CTAs
   to a minimum in your email. Focus on where you want people to go and
   remove any unneeded noise. Here are some things you should consider
   when crafting your button:
     * Size ‚Äì Keep your buttons big enough that people can tap on them on
       their phone. Typically that means around 50 pixels tall.
     * Color ‚Äì Most brands match the color of their button to their
       brand‚Äôs colors, contrasting against the background color and the
       space around it. Hover effects (changing color when one scrolls
       over) is supported by most email clients and is being used more
       often.
     * Frequency ‚Äì The number of buttons you have in an email is
       determined by how many actions are possible to take. For retailers,
       that may be multiple products with each have their own button. For
       others, that may be just one to focus on the most important
       message.
     * Language ‚Äì The button is there for viewers to take action, so an
       active verb is typically used to help them take that action.

   Because many email clients will block image loading by default,
   designing your buttons as images can have a negative effect. Using a
   ‚Äúbulletproof button‚Äù (a small snippet of HTML and in-line CSS) will
   ensure that your button is rendered when images are turned off. You can
   use this tool to create one:

Links

   Check every link in your email on mobile and desktop. Things to look
   for include if it goes to where you wanted it to, does it have UTM
   tracking, is it clear in the email that it‚Äôs a clickable link, are any
   email browsers changing the color of your links?

   Also, keep an eye on dates in your email. Even though you don‚Äôt link
   them, Gmail and Apple like to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù by turning them into blue
   clickable links. You can use CSS to override the link style to look
   like regular body text.

   How to stop Apple from making links blue:
   a[x-apple-data-detectors] {
   color: inherit !important;
   text-decoration: none !important;
   font-size: inherit !important;
   font-family: inherit !important;
   font-weight: inherit !important;
   line-height: inherit !important;
   }

Video

   It‚Äôs common to think that when you use video in email, that the video
   will simply play, right inside the email. That would be a magical
   thing, much like a rainbow unicorn, but many email clients like Gmail,
   Outlook, Thunderbird, and others don‚Äôt support the technical
   requirements needed to play video inside the email.

   But over half of email clients support HTML5 so you can definitely
   embed video in your email or many ESPs enable you to have a static
   image with a play button that links to the hosted version of the video.
   You can also use an animated GIF instead.

   Pro Tip: Use a video thumbnail with a play button or GIF teaser of the
   video to get more clicks.

GIFs

   Animated GIFs are a great alternative to using video if you want to add
   moving content to your emails.

   Animated GIF files can get rather large the more animation, frames, and
   colors there are in the image. To keep them as small as possible, only
   animate what you need to animate, keep it short, and don‚Äôt use every
   color in the book.

   It‚Äôs a good idea to keep your GIF file size as close to 1MB as
   possible. Under is perfect. A little over is still okay too.

Copy/Tone

   Understand your audience to know what kind of language will work best.
   Some subscriber lists are more formal whereas other are casual and okay
   with the odd profanity inclusion (tread lightly here unless you are one
   hundred percent sure your audience can handle it.) Writing a
   high-performing email campaign isn‚Äôt hard if you stay true to your
   brand and optimize the key parts of your email.

Spelling/Grammar

   Always send a test of your email to at least two other people who can
   check your email top to bottom with fresh eyes and look for typos,
   grammatical errors and other mishaps. You can use this preflight email
   checklist to avoid common errors before you push send.

A/B Testing

   A/B testing can be applied to many components of your email but the
   subject line is one of the most popular, and easy things to test. Most
   ESPs make this super simple and include it as part of their system.

   Email Campaign ‚Äì A/B Testing ‚Äì Email Subject Line

   Some interesting things you can test in your subject lines include:
     * Length ‚Äì Test short subject lines vs. longer subject lines (this is
       the topic of much debate in the marketing world)
     * Topic ‚Äì Test two completely different topics as the subject line,
       to see what content is of most interest to subscribers
     * Personalization ‚Äì Add personalization to identical subject lines to
       see if a first name greeting, for example, gets a better response.
     * Promotion/Offer ‚Äì See what kind of promotion works best by offering
       ‚ÄúFree Shipping‚Äù vs. ‚Äú15% Off‚Äù

Legal

   Your email will need at least the address of the company which is
   sending it and an unsubscribe link to be compliant with government
   regulations around the world. Your legal team will probably want to add
   in some other information such as terms and conditions too if it
   applies to your messaging. It is always good to get a sign-off from a
   manager or counsel to make sure that you have everything necessary to
   protect your rights.

Social Links

   Even though it will be a small percentage of clicks from your email, it
   is always a best practice to show your audience where else they can
   follow your company. Each social media platform has its own purpose,
   which your email may not be satisfying. Select the ones that your
   company uses the most (there‚Äôs no need to show every single social
   profile your company has). Social icons that match your branding or the
   rest of the email is a nice touch.

   Be sure to show the difference of social share vs. social page icons.

App

   Consider including a link to download your app if you have one.

Referral

   Want to spread the word about your product or service? Include a
   referral link section of your brand has an incentive program set up.
   It‚Äôs a good module to include in transactional emails.

Support

   Contact us or support links. Ask for feedback about the email. If your
   email is a noreply@ then give your customers a clear way they should
   reach out to you. Shows brand has a customer support focus and gives
   customers the opportunity to speak up about their experiences.

The Really Good Guide to Email Design (+ Bonus Checklist)

   KIM STIGLITZ - FEB 7, 2019

   Article first published May 2017, updated February 2019.

   Want an email that looks awesome and converts like crazy? We joined
   forces with the talented crew from Really Good Emails to take the
   guesswork out of designing an excellent email with this email design
   guide and checklist that‚Äôll make every email you send more awesome.

   In this guide, we‚Äôll cover email design best practices for all the
   different elements of your email campaigns and have a bonus checklist
   for you at the end. So let‚Äôs get to it.

Subject Line

   While not a traditional ‚Äúdesign element‚Äù your subject line is
   considered one of the most important factors in getting your email
   opened so your subscribers can see your sweet design so make it
   engaging, personal, and relevant. Remember, that overuse of CAPS and
   unnecessary punctuation, as well as some words, can trigger spam
   filters so respect your subscribers and don‚Äôt go there. Use these words
   instead.

   Bonus: CoSchedule has an excellent Headline Analyzer that could also be
   applied to email subject lines.

Is longer better?

   When it comes to email subject lines longer isn‚Äôt necessarily better.
   It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that your subscribers use a variety of
   different browsers and email clients as well as mobile devices to
   consume your emails.

   According to data from Return Path, 65 characters seems to be a sweet
   spot for email subject lines, which is about 15 characters more than
   the average subject line. When subject lines are 61-70 characters long,
   they tend to get read. However, most email subject lines are between 41
   and 50 characters.

What about symbols in subject lines?

   The saying ‚Äúa picture is worth a thousand words‚Äù may never be more true
   than when it comes to emoji. And emoji in email subject lines can have
   a major impact. Not only can they take the place of words, be
   attention-grabbing, and add a definite charm, they can increase your
   open rates. A report by Experian noted that fifty-six percent of brands
   using emoji in their email subject lines had a higher unique open rate.
   Consider us üëç.

Things to keep in mind when using emoji in email

   If an emoji isn‚Äôt supported in the email client, the recipient may see
   a ‚òê character instead.

   Remember: Gmail has to have some extra special considerations when
   using emoji. You may notice in Gmail when you use emoji in the subject
   line the icon will look different in the inbox view and after the email
   has been opened. This is due to the inbox view using the Android
   version of the emoji, meanwhile, the opened email view uses Google‚Äôs
   own emoji style. While the emoji basically look the same, it‚Äôs still
   worth testing to make sure the same sentiment is expressed in both
   versions.

   In addition, for Inbox by Gmail, it‚Äôs currently not possible to insert
   emoticons in Inbox messages using the browser version.

Preheader

   Your preheader can be visible in the inbox preview and in the body of
   your email, or just in the preview pane if you want to save email real
   estate. Preheaders add valuable context to your subject line and can
   help your open rate. Keep it short (between 40-70 characters) and to
   the point. Use this space to help your customer know why the email is
   useful to them. Your subject line and preheader text should work
   together.

Personalization

   Emails with personalized subject lines are 26% more likely to be
   opened. Go beyond just using your subscriber‚Äôs name in the subject line
   and use other data you have to fuel super relevant messages.

   Adding company name, last purchase, or other information helps you to
   personalize the email in the perfect way for each subscriber. But
   really good personalization involves more than just injecting a first
   name. Think about how you could completely change the email based on
   someone‚Äôs information.

   Stop thinking of emails as one-to-many and think about them as
   one-to-one‚Äîwhere each email is customized to each subscriber.

Humanization / Contextual Marketing

   A term that‚Äôs been getting popular is contextual marketing or
   humanization which focuses on making the email more of a 1-to-1
   engagement rather than a 1-to-many type email that‚Äôs one-size fits all.

   This leads to emails specifically tailored to the subscriber which will
   lead to higher engagement.

   Spotify is a great example with their year-end campaign showing each
   subscriber what their most listened songs were and where they ranked in
   their favorite artists‚Äô fan rankings (based on how many times they
   listened to their music).


   Making your email feel more ‚Äúhumananized‚Äù and like it was built for
   each subscriber has many benefits including increased engagement,
   better relationships with your subscribers, and even people getting
   excited to receive and open your email.

Dynamic Content

   For those wanting to get serious with personalization, you can also
   dynamically change entire sections of content within your email to make
   the entire campaign more relevant and more appealing to subscribers.

   A common use case for this would be showing menswear to your male
   subscribers while showing womenswear to female subscribers. Check out
   how Adidas did it in this email:

Email Layout

   Your email layout should help the viewer know what they should check
   out first, and where they can go from there. They should be able to
   scan the email quickly using a logical hierarchy with large headlines
   and images focusing the attention. Use layout to break up space and
   help create chunks of content.

Inverted Pyramid

   We‚Äôre big fans of the inverted pyramid model. It‚Äôs essentially a
   framework for structuring the elements of your email campaigns
   (headers, imagery, buttons, etc) so they work together to draw people
   in, deliver the key messages of your campaign and get them to
   click-through.

   By guiding a subscriber‚Äôs eye down the page to your CTA, you‚Äôll
   encourage them to click through to explore more of what you have to
   offer, resulting in better brand awareness, more web traffic, and
   ultimately more sales.

Zig-Zag

   Another effective design grid is an angular one with a zig-zag layout.

     According to the graphic designer, Mary Stribley, an ‚Äúangular layout
     is both enticing to look at as well as functional to order lots of
     information and imagery.‚Äù

   You can create these angles through using imagery or color blocking in
   order to guide the reader through each step of the email. This not only
   creates a visually pleasing layout, it also helps to simplify each
   section of the email so that it is easy to read.


One Column

   One column emails work great on desktop and mobile. These mobile first
   emails usually adapt to desktop and scale images. It helps consumers
   navigate the email without overwhelming them. The one column design
   makes it obvious what information is important and what you want a
   consumer to do next.

Email Width

   To ensure that your email renders well in every email client, we can
   push the envelope on our email widths to at least 640 pixels. At widths
   wider than 640px Gmail doesn‚Äôt show any background color that would
   appear in the margins at most reasonable browser sizes (you can see
   them if you stretch your browser to wider than 1200px). For our
   designs, 600px is usually the sweet spot.

   Plus, email clients don‚Äôt use the full width of your screen to display
   an email message. Some show ads or have navigation or a menu so there
   are limitations to the real estate on a screen.

Images

   When using images in your emails, it‚Äôs important to keep the following
   in mind:
     * Dimension ‚Äì most emails are 600-640px wide. However, to keep your
       image crisp on high-resolution displays, you need to make your
       image 2x the size (ie. 1200px) and use the image attributes and CSS
       to keep the image at the width you want.
     * File Size ‚Äì It‚Äôs easy to forget about file size in an email but you
       want to make sure your images are optimized. Especially since more
       than 50% of emails are opened on mobile devices. The bigger the
       email, the longer it‚Äôll take for mobile subscribers to view and
       thus create a negative experience with your email. Read more about
       best practices for image-heavy emails here.
     * Alt Text ‚Äì If your image doesn‚Äôt load or breaks somewhere along the
       sending process, Alt Text is the text that will display in its
       place. This is another area that many email marketers overlook. Add
       in helpful Alt Text that adds to your message in the case that your
       image doesn‚Äôt load. If your image has text on it, I usually write
       the overlaying text as the alt text. This way if the image doesn‚Äôt
       load, the text will still be read. Including ALT text also makes
       your email more accessible.
     * Use images that complement the email ‚Äì Your email should not be a
       bunch of images placed together. An image should add to the email
       and messaging‚Äînot be the messaging. A simple way to test this is to
       view your email with images turned off. Does the email still make
       sense? Is the message still clear? Our friends at Email Monks offer
       some solid advice on the optimal text to image ratio.
     * Stock Images ‚Äì Stock imagery can sometimes take your audience out
       of the messaging. Keep your images on brand and genuine. Take the
       time if you have the opportunity to create specific imagery for
       your email campaign! If not, use imagery from paid sites like
       stocksy.com or free sites like deathtothestockphoto.com. Here are a
       few more to check out.

Images and Alt Text

   Alt text is simply the alternative text displayed with an image. Think
   of it as the backup text that provides some context about what your
   image is, for those that have images blocked or turned off by default.
   Many marketers learn about alt text the hard way by forgetting to use
   it and suffering the consequences. Don‚Äôt be that person.

   As you can see from the example below, when images are blocked,
   subscribers see what looks like a broken image, or a red ‚ÄúX‚Äù. In this
   case, alt text indicates that there is an image and provided a little
   context about the image to encourage subscribers to ‚Äúturn on or enable‚Äù
   images in the email.

   For more on Alt text check out our design guide and this post by our
   pals at Litmus.

Web Fonts + Fallbacks

   When it comes to email marketing, it‚Äôs best practice to use web fonts
   wherever you can, however, it‚Äôs important to keep in mind, that not all
   email clients offer universal support for web fonts.

   Example: Uses @import + @fontface to bring in Clobber, Gotham Book,
   Gotham Medium, and Montserrat fonts.

   Google Fonts is a great resource to add web fonts to your emails. We
   suggest using live text when possible for better legibility across
   devices and consistent brand experience from email to website to add
   web fonts to your emails.

@import

   @import url http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans

   Currently, the @import method is not supported in AOL using IE11 and
   Android 2.3.

<link>

   <link href=‚Äùhttp://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans‚Äù
   rel=‚Äùstylesheet‚Äù type=‚Äùtext/css‚Äù>‚Ä®‚Ä®The <link> method is fully supported
   among the email clients listed above. Web font services will provide
   you with the href value to use for your web font of choice. If you‚Äôre
   hosting your own web-font, you‚Äôll have to change the href value to
   where you‚Äôve hosted your web font.

@font-face

   <style type="text/css">
   ‚Ä®@media screen {‚Ä®
   @font-face{‚Ä®
   font-family:'Open Sans';‚Ä®
   font-style:normal;‚Ä®
   font-weight:400;‚Ä®
    src:local('Open Sans'), local('OpenSans'),
   url('http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/opensans/v10/cJZKeOuBrn4kERxqtaUH3bO3Ld
   cAZYWl9Si6vvxL-qU.woff') format('woff');‚Ä®   }‚Ä®}
   ‚Ä®</style>‚Ä®‚Ä®

   Think of the @font-face method as a direct-to-the-source sort of method
   of importing your web fonts. It can be more reliable to import the web
   font directly from the source as you can choose which format of web
   font you want to import. Especially if you‚Äôre given a choice, which
   some web font suppliers do have.

   If web fonts are not supported there are fallback fonts that will be
   seen instead. When setting fallbacks, remember to use a ‚Äúweb safe
   font‚Äù. System fonts like Calibri are not always supported across all
   clients.

   Each email client also has a preferred or default font which users
   would see instead of your chosen web font. The three most popular
   desktop email clients have the following defaults:

   Apple Mail = Helvetica
   Gmail = Arial
   Microsoft Outlook = Times New Roman

   Outlook is a special case. If a webfont fails in Outlook, it ignores
   the fallback fonts and just decides to render everything in Times New
   Roman. If this happens, add this CSS to your email and you should be
   good to go.

   <!--[if mso]>
   <style type="text/css">
   body, table, td, p, li, a {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif
   !important;}
   </style>
   <![endif]-->

   Add other elements like p, li, a, etc. if you need to fix Outlook
   rendering Times New Roman on those elements too.

   guide here.

White Space

   White space is the blank area around your paragraphs, images, and call
   to action buttons.

   Adding ample white space around the elements in your email encourages
   click-throughs by separating them visually from other elements in your
   email and helping focus the reader‚Äôs attention on them at the right
   time. It can also increase the legibility of your email and improves
   the eyes‚Äô ability to follow the content. Use your best judgment to
   ensure your copy and CTA button are separated enough to stand out, but
   close to enough that your readers know they‚Äôre connected.

Mobile Optimization

   Email opens on mobile devices just keep increasing year after year. The
   latest stats are that over 68% of email opens occur on mobile. Making
   your emails mobile-friendly is easier than ever by:
     * Using a mobile-friendly template
     * Keep your subject line short
     * Use preheader text
     * Use minimal body copy
     * Use one clear and easy to click CTA button (According to a recent
       MIT study, the average size of an adult index finger is between
       1.6cm and 2 cm, which translates to between 45 x 45px and 57 x 57px
       on a mobile device.) Multiple CTAs can be confusing and lead to
       overwhelm, which you definitely want to avoid.
     * Increase the size of body copy if it‚Äôs small on desktop emails.
       (16px is a good size for mobile)
     * Make sure your images aren‚Äôt too small or hard to see when on
       mobile

Coding Mobile Emails

   If you are coding your emails, there are two approaches to mobile
   emails: responsive and hybrid.

Responsive

   Responsive uses media queries and CSS to override the existing styles
   when the email is viewed on a small display.

   @media screen and (max-width: 480px) {
   .responsive-table {
   display: block;
   width: 100% !important;
   }

   .responsive-image {
   height: auto;
   max-width: 100% !important;
   }
   }

Hybrid

   Hybrid gets a little more complex but relies on using a fluid layout
   that will shrink and grow with the size of the display. Plus, it
   doesn‚Äôt rely on media queries which can be a big bonus if you‚Äôre
   targeting email clients that don‚Äôt support media queries.

CTAs + Bulletproof Buttons

   An ideal CTA button has three main aspects that work together to create
   an effective conversion point for the reader:
     * Copy ‚Äì be specific and focus on the benefit
     * Design ‚Äì stands out, appropriately sized, has whitespace around it
     * Placement ‚Äì the ideal placement of the CTA button is relative to
       the complexity of the offer. If the offer is more complex, you may
       need more explanation copy before the CTA.

   It‚Äôs always good to have a couple different button types for different
   priorities in your email. For example, having an orange button with
   white text for your main CTAs and light gray buttons with dark text for
   secondary elements. However, it‚Äôs important to keep the number of CTAs
   to a minimum in your email. Focus on where you want people to go and
   remove any unneeded noise. Here are some things you should consider
   when crafting your button:
     * Size ‚Äì Keep your buttons big enough that people can tap on them on
       their phone. Typically that means around 50 pixels tall.
     * Color ‚Äì Most brands match the color of their button to their
       brand‚Äôs colors, contrasting against the background color and the
       space around it. Hover effects (changing color when one scrolls
       over) is supported by most email clients and is being used more
       often.
     * Frequency ‚Äì The number of buttons you have in an email is
       determined by how many actions are possible to take. For retailers,
       that may be multiple products with each have their own button. For
       others, that may be just one to focus on the most important
       message.
     * Language ‚Äì The button is there for viewers to take action, so an
       active verb is typically used to help them take that action.

   Because many email clients will block image loading by default,
   designing your buttons as images can have a negative effect. Using a
   ‚Äúbulletproof button‚Äù (a small snippet of HTML and in-line CSS) will
   ensure that your button is rendered when images are turned off. You can
   use this tool to create one:

Links

   Check every link in your email on mobile and desktop. Things to look
   for include if it goes to where you wanted it to, does it have UTM
   tracking, is it clear in the email that it‚Äôs a clickable link, are any
   email browsers changing the color of your links?

   Also, keep an eye on dates in your email. Even though you don‚Äôt link
   them, Gmail and Apple like to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù by turning them into blue
   clickable links. You can use CSS to override the link style to look
   like regular body text.

   How to stop Apple from making links blue:
   a[x-apple-data-detectors] {
   color: inherit !important;
   text-decoration: none !important;
   font-size: inherit !important;
   font-family: inherit !important;
   font-weight: inherit !important;
   line-height: inherit !important;
   }

Video

   It‚Äôs common to think that when you use video in email, that the video
   will simply play, right inside the email. That would be a magical
   thing, much like a rainbow unicorn, but many email clients like Gmail,
   Outlook, Thunderbird, and others don‚Äôt support the technical
   requirements needed to play video inside the email.

   But over half of email clients support HTML5 so you can definitely
   embed video in your email or many ESPs enable you to have a static
   image with a play button that links to the hosted version of the video.
   You can also use an animated GIF instead.

   Pro Tip: Use a video thumbnail with a play button or GIF teaser of the
   video to get more clicks.

GIFs

   Animated GIFs are a great alternative to using video if you want to add
   moving content to your emails.

   Animated GIF files can get rather large the more animation, frames, and
   colors there are in the image. To keep them as small as possible, only
   animate what you need to animate, keep it short, and don‚Äôt use every
   color in the book.

   It‚Äôs a good idea to keep your GIF file size as close to 1MB as
   possible. Under is perfect. A little over is still okay too.

Copy/Tone

   Understand your audience to know what kind of language will work best.
   Some subscriber lists are more formal whereas other are casual and okay
   with the odd profanity inclusion (tread lightly here unless you are one
   hundred percent sure your audience can handle it.) Writing a
   high-performing email campaign isn‚Äôt hard if you stay true to your
   brand and optimize the key parts of your email.

Spelling/Grammar

   Always send a test of your email to at least two other people who can
   check your email top to bottom with fresh eyes and look for typos,
   grammatical errors and other mishaps. You can use this preflight email
   checklist to avoid common errors before you push send.

A/B Testing

   A/B testing can be applied to many components of your email but the
   subject line is one of the most popular, and easy things to test. Most
   ESPs make this super simple and include it as part of their system.

   Some interesting things you can test in your subject lines include:
     * Length ‚Äì Test short subject lines vs. longer subject lines (this is
       the topic of much debate in the marketing world)
     * Topic ‚Äì Test two completely different topics as the subject line,
       to see what content is of most interest to subscribers
     * Personalization ‚Äì Add personalization to identical subject lines to
       see if a first name greeting, for example, gets a better response.
     * Promotion/Offer ‚Äì See what kind of promotion works best by offering
       ‚ÄúFree Shipping‚Äù vs. ‚Äú15% Off‚Äù

   Bonus: CoSchedule, uses Campaign Monitor to send their popular email
   newsletter The Content Marketing Update. See how they systematically
   A/B test email subject lines to find out what works for their audience.

Legal

   Your email will need at least the address of the company which is
   sending it and an unsubscribe link to be compliant with government
   regulations around the world. Your legal team will probably want to add
   in some other information such as terms and conditions too if it
   applies to your messaging. It is always good to get a sign-off from a
   manager or counsel to make sure that you have everything necessary to
   protect your rights.

Social Links

   Even though it will be a small percentage of clicks from your email, it
   is always a best practice to show your audience where else they can
   follow your company. Each social media platform has its own purpose,
   which your email may not be satisfying. Select the ones that your
   company uses the most (there‚Äôs no need to show every single social
   profile your company has). Social icons that match your branding or the
   rest of the email is a nice touch.

   Be sure to show the difference of social share vs. social page icons.

App

   Consider including a link to download your app if you have one.

Referral

   Want to spread the word about your product or service? Include a
   referral link section of your brand has an incentive program set up.
   It‚Äôs a good module to include in transactional emails.

Support

   Contact us or support links. Ask for feedback about the email. If your
   email is a noreply@ then give your customers a clear way they should
   reach out to you. Shows brand has a customer support focus and gives
   customers the opportunity to speak up about their experiences.

   Article first published May 2017, updated February 2019.

   Want an email that looks awesome and converts like crazy? We joined
   forces with the talented crew from Really Good Emails to take the
   guesswork out of designing an excellent email with this email design
   guide and checklist that‚Äôll make every email you send more awesome.

   In this guide, we‚Äôll cover email design best practices for all the
   different elements of your email campaigns and have a bonus checklist
   for you at the end. So let‚Äôs get to it.

Subject Line

   While not a traditional ‚Äúdesign element‚Äù your subject line is
   considered one of the most important factors in getting your email
   opened so your subscribers can see your sweet design so make it
   engaging, personal, and relevant. Remember, that overuse of CAPS and
   unnecessary punctuation, as well as some words, can trigger spam
   filters so respect your subscribers and don‚Äôt go there. Use these words
   instead.

   Bonus: CoSchedule has an excellent Headline Analyzer that could also be
   applied to email subject lines.

Is longer better?

   When it comes to email subject lines longer isn‚Äôt necessarily better.
   It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that your subscribers use a variety of
   different browsers and email clients as well as mobile devices to
   consume your emails.

   According to data from Return Path, 65 characters seems to be a sweet
   spot for email subject lines, which is about 15 characters more than
   the average subject line. When subject lines are 61-70 characters long,
   they tend to get read. However, most email subject lines are between 41
   and 50 characters.

   Return Path ‚Äì Email Subject Line ‚Äì Length and Read Rate

What about symbols in subject lines?

   The saying ‚Äúa picture is worth a thousand words‚Äù may never be more true
   than when it comes to emoji. And emoji in email subject lines can have
   a major impact. Not only can they take the place of words, be
   attention-grabbing, and add a definite charm, they can increase your
   open rates. A report by Experian noted that fifty-six percent of brands
   using emoji in their email subject lines had a higher unique open rate.
   Consider us üëç.

   Campaign Monitor - emoji in subject lines

Things to keep in mind when using emoji in email

   If an emoji isn‚Äôt supported in the email client, the recipient may see
   a ‚òê character instead.

   Remember: Gmail has to have some extra special considerations when
   using emoji. You may notice in Gmail when you use emoji in the subject
   line the icon will look different in the inbox view and after the email
   has been opened. This is due to the inbox view using the Android
   version of the emoji, meanwhile, the opened email view uses Google‚Äôs
   own emoji style. While the emoji basically look the same, it‚Äôs still
   worth testing to make sure the same sentiment is expressed in both
   versions.

   In addition, for Inbox by Gmail, it‚Äôs currently not possible to insert
   emoticons in Inbox messages using the browser version.

Preheader

   Your preheader can be visible in the inbox preview and in the body of
   your email, or just in the preview pane if you want to save email real
   estate. Preheaders add valuable context to your subject line and can
   help your open rate. Keep it short (between 40-70 characters) and to
   the point. Use this space to help your customer know why the email is
   useful to them. Your subject line and preheader text should work
   together.

Personalization

   Emails with personalized subject lines are 26% more likely to be
   opened. Go beyond just using your subscriber‚Äôs name in the subject line
   and use other data you have to fuel super relevant messages.

   Experian ‚Äì Email Subject Line - Personalization

   Adding company name, last purchase, or other information helps you to
   personalize the email in the perfect way for each subscriber. But
   really good personalization involves more than just injecting a first
   name. Think about how you could completely change the email based on
   someone‚Äôs information.

   Stop thinking of emails as one-to-many and think about them as
   one-to-one‚Äîwhere each email is customized to each subscriber.

Humanization / Contextual Marketing

   A term that‚Äôs been getting popular is contextual marketing or
   humanization which focuses on making the email more of a 1-to-1
   engagement rather than a 1-to-many type email that‚Äôs one-size fits all.

   This leads to emails specifically tailored to the subscriber which will
   lead to higher engagement.

   Spotify is a great example with their year-end campaign showing each
   subscriber what their most listened songs were and where they ranked in
   their favorite artists‚Äô fan rankings (based on how many times they
   listened to their music).
   Spotify ‚Äì Humanization ‚Äì Email Marketing


   Making your email feel more ‚Äúhumananized‚Äù and like it was built for
   each subscriber has many benefits including increased engagement,
   better relationships with your subscribers, and even people getting
   excited to receive and open your email.

Dynamic Content

   For those wanting to get serious with personalization, you can also
   dynamically change entire sections of content within your email to make
   the entire campaign more relevant and more appealing to subscribers.

   A common use case for this would be showing menswear to your male
   subscribers while showing womenswear to female subscribers. Check out
   how Adidas did it in this email:

Email Layout

   Your email layout should help the viewer know what they should check
   out first, and where they can go from there. They should be able to
   scan the email quickly using a logical hierarchy with large headlines
   and images focusing the attention. Use layout to break up space and
   help create chunks of content.

Inverted Pyramid

   We‚Äôre big fans of the inverted pyramid model. It‚Äôs essentially a
   framework for structuring the elements of your email campaigns
   (headers, imagery, buttons, etc) so they work together to draw people
   in, deliver the key messages of your campaign and get them to
   click-through.

   InVision ‚Äì Email Design ‚Äì Inverted Pyramid

   By guiding a subscriber‚Äôs eye down the page to your CTA, you‚Äôll
   encourage them to click through to explore more of what you have to
   offer, resulting in better brand awareness, more web traffic, and
   ultimately more sales.

Zig-Zag

   Another effective design grid is an angular one with a zig-zag layout.

     According to the graphic designer, Mary Stribley, an ‚Äúangular layout
     is both enticing to look at as well as functional to order lots of
     information and imagery.‚Äù

   You can create these angles through using imagery or color blocking in
   order to guide the reader through each step of the email. This not only
   creates a visually pleasing layout, it also helps to simplify each
   section of the email so that it is easy to read.

One Column

   One column emails work great on desktop and mobile. These mobile first
   emails usually adapt to desktop and scale images. It helps consumers
   navigate the email without overwhelming them. The one column design
   makes it obvious what information is important and what you want a
   consumer to do next.
   Code School ‚Äì One Column Email Design

Email Width

   To ensure that your email renders well in every email client, we can
   push the envelope on our email widths to at least 640 pixels. At widths
   wider than 640px Gmail doesn‚Äôt show any background color that would
   appear in the margins at most reasonable browser sizes (you can see
   them if you stretch your browser to wider than 1200px). For our
   designs, 600px is usually the sweet spot.

   Plus, email clients don‚Äôt use the full width of your screen to display
   an email message. Some show ads or have navigation or a menu so there
   are limitations to the real estate on a screen.

Images

   When using images in your emails, it‚Äôs important to keep the following
   in mind:
     * Dimension ‚Äì most emails are 600-640px wide. However, to keep your
       image crisp on high-resolution displays, you need to make your
       image 2x the size (ie. 1200px) and use the image attributes and CSS
       to keep the image at the width you want.
     * File Size ‚Äì It‚Äôs easy to forget about file size in an email but you
       want to make sure your images are optimized. Especially since more
       than 50% of emails are opened on mobile devices. The bigger the
       email, the longer it‚Äôll take for mobile subscribers to view and
       thus create a negative experience with your email. Read more about
       best practices for image-heavy emails here.
     * Alt Text ‚Äì If your image doesn‚Äôt load or breaks somewhere along the
       sending process, Alt Text is the text that will display in its
       place. This is another area that many email marketers overlook. Add
       in helpful Alt Text that adds to your message in the case that your
       image doesn‚Äôt load. If your image has text on it, I usually write
       the overlaying text as the alt text. This way if the image doesn‚Äôt
       load, the text will still be read. Including ALT text also makes
       your email more accessible.
     * Use images that complement the email ‚Äì Your email should not be a
       bunch of images placed together. An image should add to the email
       and messaging‚Äînot be the messaging. A simple way to test this is to
       view your email with images turned off. Does the email still make
       sense? Is the message still clear? Our friends at Email Monks offer
       some solid advice on the optimal text to image ratio.
     * Stock Images ‚Äì Stock imagery can sometimes take your audience out
       of the messaging. Keep your images on brand and genuine. Take the
       time if you have the opportunity to create specific imagery for
       your email campaign! If not, use imagery from paid sites like
       stocksy.com or free sites like deathtothestockphoto.com. Here are a
       few more to check out.

Images and Alt Text

   Alt text is simply the alternative text displayed with an image. Think
   of it as the backup text that provides some context about what your
   image is, for those that have images blocked or turned off by default.
   Many marketers learn about alt text the hard way by forgetting to use
   it and suffering the consequences. Don‚Äôt be that person.

   As you can see from the example below, when images are blocked,
   subscribers see what looks like a broken image, or a red ‚ÄúX‚Äù. In this
   case, alt text indicates that there is an image and provided a little
   context about the image to encourage subscribers to ‚Äúturn on or enable‚Äù
   images in the email.

   pals at Litmus.

Web Fonts + Fallbacks

   When it comes to email marketing, it‚Äôs best practice to use web fonts
   wherever you can, however, it‚Äôs important to keep in mind, that not all
   email clients offer universal support for web fonts.

   Example: Uses @import + @fontface to bring in Clobber, Gotham Book,
   Gotham Medium, and Montserrat fonts.
   Lyft - web fonts for email

   Google Fonts is a great resource to add web fonts to your emails. We
   suggest using live text when possible for better legibility across
   devices and consistent brand experience from email to website to add
   web fonts to your emails.

@import

   @import url http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans

   Currently, the @import method is not supported in AOL using IE11 and
   Android 2.3.

<link>

   <link href=‚Äùhttp://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans‚Äù
   rel=‚Äùstylesheet‚Äù type=‚Äùtext/css‚Äù>‚Ä®‚Ä®The <link> method is fully supported
   among the email clients listed above. Web font services will provide
   you with the href value to use for your web font of choice. If you‚Äôre
   hosting your own web-font, you‚Äôll have to change the href value to
   where you‚Äôve hosted your web font.

@font-face

   <style type="text/css">‚Ä®@media screen {‚Ä®   @font-face{‚Ä®
   font-family:'Open Sans';‚Ä®       font-style:normal;‚Ä®
   font-weight:400;‚Ä®       src:local('Open Sans'), local('OpenSans'),
   url('http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/opensans/v10/cJZKeOuBrn4kERxqtaUH3bO3Ld
   cAZYWl9Si6vvxL-qU.woff') format('woff');‚Ä®   }‚Ä®}‚Ä®</style>‚Ä®‚Ä®

   Think of the @font-face method as a direct-to-the-source sort of method
   of importing your web fonts. It can be more reliable to import the web
   font directly from the source as you can choose which format of web
   font you want to import. Especially if you‚Äôre given a choice, which
   some web font suppliers do have.

   If web fonts are not supported there are fallback fonts that will be
   seen instead. When setting fallbacks, remember to use a ‚Äúweb safe
   font‚Äù. System fonts like Calibri are not always supported across all
   clients.

   Email Marketing - Safe Web Fonts

   Each email client also has a preferred or default font which users
   would see instead of your chosen web font. The three most popular
   desktop email clients have the following defaults:

   Apple Mail = Helvetica
   Gmail = Arial
   Microsoft Outlook = Times New Roman

   Outlook is a special case. If a webfont fails in Outlook, it ignores
   the fallback fonts and just decides to render everything in Times New
   Roman. If this happens, add this CSS to your email and you should be
   good to go.

   <!--[if mso]>
   <style type="text/css">
   body, table, td, p, li, a {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif
   !important;}
   </style>
   <![endif]-->

   Add other elements like p, li, a, etc. if you need to fix Outlook
   rendering Times New Roman on those elements too.

   guide here.

White Space

   White space is the blank area around your paragraphs, images, and call
   to action buttons.

   Adding ample white space around the elements in your email encourages
   click-throughs by separating them visually from other elements in your
   email and helping focus the reader‚Äôs attention on them at the right
   time. It can also increase the legibility of your email and improves
   the eyes‚Äô ability to follow the content. Use your best judgment to
   ensure your copy and CTA button are separated enough to stand out, but
   close to enough that your readers know they‚Äôre connected.

Mobile Optimization

   Email opens on mobile devices just keep increasing year after year. The
   latest stats are that over 68% of email opens occur on mobile. Making
   your emails mobile-friendly is easier than ever by:
     * Using a mobile-friendly template
     * Keep your subject line short
     * Use preheader text
     * Use minimal body copy
     * Use one clear and easy to click CTA button (According to a recent
       MIT study, the average size of an adult index finger is between
       1.6cm and 2 cm, which translates to between 45 x 45px and 57 x 57px
       on a mobile device.) Multiple CTAs can be confusing and lead to
       overwhelm, which you definitely want to avoid.
     * Increase the size of body copy if it‚Äôs small on desktop emails.
       (16px is a good size for mobile)
     * Make sure your images aren‚Äôt too small or hard to see when on
       mobile

Coding Mobile Emails

   If you are coding your emails, there are two approaches to mobile
   emails: responsive and hybrid.

Responsive

   Responsive uses media queries and CSS to override the existing styles
   when the email is viewed on a small display.

   @media screen and (max-width: 480px) {
   .responsive-table {
   display: block;
   width: 100% !important;
   }

   .responsive-image {
   height: auto;
   max-width: 100% !important;
   }
   }

Hybrid

   Hybrid gets a little more complex but relies on using a fluid layout
   that will shrink and grow with the size of the display. Plus, it
   doesn‚Äôt rely on media queries which can be a big bonus if you‚Äôre
   targeting email clients that don‚Äôt support media queries.

CTAs + Bulletproof Buttons

   An ideal CTA button has three main aspects that work together to create
   an effective conversion point for the reader:
     * Copy ‚Äì be specific and focus on the benefit
     * Design ‚Äì stands out, appropriately sized, has whitespace around it
     * Placement ‚Äì the ideal placement of the CTA button is relative to
       the complexity of the offer. If the offer is more complex, you may
       need more explanation copy before the CTA.

   It‚Äôs always good to have a couple different button types for different
   priorities in your email. For example, having an orange button with
   white text for your main CTAs and light gray buttons with dark text for
   secondary elements. However, it‚Äôs important to keep the number of CTAs
   to a minimum in your email. Focus on where you want people to go and
   remove any unneeded noise. Here are some things you should consider
   when crafting your button:
     * Size ‚Äì Keep your buttons big enough that people can tap on them on
       their phone. Typically that means around 50 pixels tall.
     * Color ‚Äì Most brands match the color of their button to their
       brand‚Äôs colors, contrasting against the background color and the
       space around it. Hover effects (changing color when one scrolls
       over) is supported by most email clients and is being used more
       often.
     * Frequency ‚Äì The number of buttons you have in an email is
       determined by how many actions are possible to take. For retailers,
       that may be multiple products with each have their own button. For
       others, that may be just one to focus on the most important
       message.
     * Language ‚Äì The button is there for viewers to take action, so an
       active verb is typically used to help them take that action.

   Because many email clients will block image loading by default,
   designing your buttons as images can have a negative effect. Using a
   ‚Äúbulletproof button‚Äù (a small snippet of HTML and in-line CSS) will
   ensure that your button is rendered when images are turned off. You can
   use this tool to create one:

Links

   Check every link in your email on mobile and desktop. Things to look
   for include if it goes to where you wanted it to, does it have UTM
   tracking, is it clear in the email that it‚Äôs a clickable link, are any
   email browsers changing the color of your links?

   Also, keep an eye on dates in your email. Even though you don‚Äôt link
   them, Gmail and Apple like to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù by turning them into blue
   clickable links. You can use CSS to override the link style to look
   like regular body text.

   How to stop Apple from making links blue:
   a[x-apple-data-detectors] {
   color: inherit !important;
   text-decoration: none !important;
   font-size: inherit !important;
   font-family: inherit !important;
   font-weight: inherit !important;
   line-height: inherit !important;
   }

Video

   It‚Äôs common to think that when you use video in email, that the video
   will simply play, right inside the email. That would be a magical
   thing, much like a rainbow unicorn, but many email clients like Gmail,
   Outlook, Thunderbird, and others don‚Äôt support the technical
   requirements needed to play video inside the email.

   But over half of email clients support HTML5 so you can definitely
   embed video in your email or many ESPs enable you to have a static
   image with a play button that links to the hosted version of the video.
   You can also use an animated GIF instead.

   Pro Tip: Use a video thumbnail with a play button or GIF teaser of the
   video to get more clicks.

GIFs

   Animated GIFs are a great alternative to using video if you want to add
   moving content to your emails.

   Animated GIF files can get rather large the more animation, frames, and
   colors there are in the image. To keep them as small as possible, only
   animate what you need to animate, keep it short, and don‚Äôt use every
   color in the book.

   It‚Äôs a good idea to keep your GIF file size as close to 1MB as
   possible. Under is perfect. A little over is still okay too.

Copy/Tone

   Understand your audience to know what kind of language will work best.
   Some subscriber lists are more formal whereas other are casual and okay
   with the odd profanity inclusion (tread lightly here unless you are one
   hundred percent sure your audience can handle it.) Writing a
   high-performing email campaign isn‚Äôt hard if you stay true to your
   brand and optimize the key parts of your email.

Spelling/Grammar

   Always send a test of your email to at least two other people who can
   check your email top to bottom with fresh eyes and look for typos,
   grammatical errors and other mishaps. You can use this preflight email
   checklist to avoid common errors before you push send.

A/B Testing

   A/B testing can be applied to many components of your email but the
   subject line is one of the most popular, and easy things to test. Most
   ESPs make this super simple and include it as part of their system.

   Email Campaign ‚Äì A/B Testing ‚Äì Email Subject Line

   Some interesting things you can test in your subject lines include:
     * Length ‚Äì Test short subject lines vs. longer subject lines (this is
       the topic of much debate in the marketing world)
     * Topic ‚Äì Test two completely different topics as the subject line,
       to see what content is of most interest to subscribers
     * Personalization ‚Äì Add personalization to identical subject lines to
       see if a first name greeting, for example, gets a better response.
     * Promotion/Offer ‚Äì See what kind of promotion works best by offering
       ‚ÄúFree Shipping‚Äù vs. ‚Äú15% Off‚Äù

Legal

   Your email will need at least the address of the company which is
   sending it and an unsubscribe link to be compliant with government
   regulations around the world. Your legal team will probably want to add
   in some other information such as terms and conditions too if it
   applies to your messaging. It is always good to get a sign-off from a
   manager or counsel to make sure that you have everything necessary to
   protect your rights.

Social Links

   Even though it will be a small percentage of clicks from your email, it
   is always a best practice to show your audience where else they can
   follow your company. Each social media platform has its own purpose,
   which your email may not be satisfying. Select the ones that your
   company uses the most (there‚Äôs no need to show every single social
   profile your company has). Social icons that match your branding or the
   rest of the email is a nice touch.

   Be sure to show the difference of social share vs. social page icons.

App

   Consider including a link to download your app if you have one.

Referral

   Want to spread the word about your product or service? Include a
   referral link section of your brand has an incentive program set up.
   It‚Äôs a good module to include in transactional emails.

Support

   Contact us or support links. Ask for feedback about the email. If your
   email is a noreply@ then give your customers a clear way they should
   reach out to you. Shows brand has a customer support focus and gives
   customers the opportunity to speak up about their experiences.
