Why Gazebo?

   Robot simulation is an essential tool in every roboticist's toolbox. A
   well-designed simulator makes it possible to rapidly test algorithms,
   design robots, perform regression testing, and train AI system using
   realistic scenarios. Gazebo offers the ability to accurately and
   efficiently simulate populations of robots in complex indoor and
   outdoor environments. At your fingertips is a robust physics engine,
   high-quality graphics, and convenient programmatic and graphical
   interfaces. Best of all, Gazebo is free with a vibrant community.

Future of Gazebo

   The latest release of Gazebo, Gazebo 10, was rolled out in January
   2019. We plan to continue to support Gazebo over the coming year and
   release Gazebo 11 in 2020. Gazebo 11 will be an LTS release, with a EOL
   date of Jan 2025. Gazebo 11 will also the be final release of the
   Gazebo lineage. Development efforts toward simulation will focus
   primarily on Ignition. Users of Gazebo can expect migration guides,
   tutorials, and additional help to be developed over the course of 2019
   and 2020 to aid in the transition.

   Over 16 years of experience has helped to inform and guide the
   development of Ignition. We believe that the shift toward Ignition will
   be extremely beneficial to community. As always, this remains an
   open-source project and we look forward to your feedback and
   contributions.

Versioning

   Gazebo uses semantic versioning, a package numbering scheme that
   specifies ABI/API compatibility between releases. A version consists of
   three numbers separated by decimal points: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH:
     * MAJOR version changed when incompatible ABI/API changes are made
     * MINOR version changed when functionality has been added in a
       backwards-compatible manne
     * PATCH version changed when backwards-compatible bug fixes are
       released

Tick-tock Release Cycle

   A tick-tock release cycle allows easy migration to new software
   versions. Obsolete Gazebo code is marked as deprecated for one major
   release. Deprecated code produces compile-time warnings. These warning
   serve as notification to users that their code should be upgraded. The
   next major release will remove the deprecated code.

   Example where function foo is deprecated and replaced by function bar:
   Gazebo v1.0 Gazebo v2.0 Gazebo v3.0
   void foo();
   // Deprecated, see void bar()
   void foo() GAZEBO_DEPRECATED(2.0);
   void bar();
   void bar();
   Statistics

Physics Engine Support

   Gazebo supports the ODE, Bullet, Simbody and DART physics engines. By
   default Gazebo is compiled with support for ODE. In order to use the
   other engines, first make sure they are installed and then compile
   Gazebo from source.
   Physics Engine Gazebo Version Availability Notes
   ODE 1.9+ Binary,Source Default engine. Gazebo maintains a fork of ODE
   which has diverged from the upstream package.
   Bullet 3.0+ Source Gazebo requires libbullet2.82, available in the OSRF
   repository and to be included in Ubuntu Utopic.
   Simbody 3.0+ Source Simbody packages are hosted in the OSRF repository.
   Expected to appear in Ubuntu Utopic official repositories.
   DART 3.0+ Source DART packages are hosted in dartsim PPA. DART is in
   the process of moving toward inclusion in Ubuntu.

We are developing a physics plugin framework to resolve dependency issues.
Each physics engine will interface to Gazebo through a plugin, avoiding the
need to compile Gazebo with support for each engine.

History

   Gazebo development began in the fall of 2002 at the University of
   Southern California. The original creators were Dr. Andrew Howard and
   his student Nate Koenig. The concept of a high-fidelity simulator
   stemmed from the need to simulate robots in outdoor environments under
   various conditions. As a complementary simulator to Stage, the name
   Gazebo was chosen as the closest structure to an outdoor stage. The
   name has stuck despite the fact that most users of Gazebo simulate
   indoor environments.

   Over the years, Nate continued development of Gazebo while completing
   his PhD. In 2009, John Hsu, a Senior Research Engineer at Willow,
   integrated ROS and the PR2 into Gazebo, which has since become one the
   primary tools used in the ROS community. A few years later in the
   Spring of 2011, Willow Garage started providing financial support for
   the development of Gazebo. In 2012, Open Source Robotics Foundation
   (OSRF) spun out of Willow Garage and became the steward of the Gazebo
   project. After significant development effort by a team of talented
   individuals, OSRF used Gazebo to run the Virtual Robotics Challenge, a
   component in the DARPA Robotics Challenge, in July of 2013.

   OSRF continues development of Gazebo with support from a diverse and
   active community. Stay tuned for more exciting developments related to
   robot simulation.
