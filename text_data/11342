Early life[edit]

   Axwell's interest in music appeared at an early age, having taught
   himself to play the drums by age nine. Four years later, the
   13-year-old exchanged his drums for a computer so he could create each
   element of his music independently.^[4] Axwell released limited copies
   of a techno/hard trance EP on vinyl under the name OXL in 1995.^[5]
   During his teenage years, he was also active in the tracking music
   scene under the moniker Quazar, releasing acid techno tracks made with
   FastTracker 2^[6] and NoiseTracker.^[7]

Career[edit]

1995–2003: Career beginnings[edit]

   Axwell began his career remixing songs by other artists, his first
   official remix being released in 2000. Some of his most notable early
   remixes include: Usher's "Burn" (BMG), Room 5's "Make Luv" (Positiva),
   Clipse & Faith Evans "Ma, I Don’t Love Her" (RCA), Stonebridge's "Put
   'em High" (Hed Kandi), N*E*R*D's single "Maybe" (Virgin), and more
   recently Hard-Fi's "Hard to Beat", Deep Dish's "Dreams", Pharrell's
   "Angel", Nelly Furtado's "Promiscuous" and Madonna's "Jump".

   Axwell has also been responsible for Jetlag's "So Right", which came
   out in September 2002 on Soulfuric, featuring the vocals of Noel McKoy
   and co-produced with Brian Tappert. In late 2002 Axwell went back to
   his roots and produced a track under his own name - "Lead Guitar" which
   was released by fellow Swede Stonebridge on his Stoney Boy imprint.

   Also leading the way has been Mambana, his collaboration with Isabel
   Fructuoso (of Afro Medusa fame).^[8] Signed to Soulfuric Recordings,
   they have released three tracks since 2002. "No Reason" was their debut
   single, which hit the top spot in all the Hype/Buzz charts that Summer
   and was featured in the sets of all the top DJs including Little Louie
   Vega, Danny Rampling and Ben Watt. The follow ups were "Felicidad" and
   "Libre". "Libre" was released in 2003 and was arguably bigger than its
   predecessor. "Libre" was licensed to more than 12 different territories
   and featured on compilations that sold in excess of half a million
   copies.

   2003 saw Axwell recording for London-based label suSU (the UK home of
   Masters at Work) under the guise of Starbeach. The track was called
   "Get Naked" & featured the vocal talents of D'Empress (from Mutiny).
   This was followed up by his version of Evelyn Thomas' classic "High
   Energy". In the autumn of 2003 Axwell's "Wait a Minute", featuring the
   vocals of Nevada, was released on Soulfuric's sub-label Device. This
   song was a club smash that gained support from the likes of Pete Tong,
   Junior Jack, Kid Creme.

2004–2007: Singles and breakthrough[edit]

   By late 2004, Axwell released "Feel the Vibe", which was re-released
   through Ministry of Sound in 2005 with new lead vocals from Tara
   McDonald who also wrote the song as "Feel the Vibe ('Til The Morning
   Comes)". McDonald's voice and writing helped secure the track as a
   radio winner and this track became one of the biggest cross over dance
   records of 2005. It was a breakthrough record for both Axwell & Tara
   McDonald. It peaked at #1 in UK Dance Singles Chart and #16 in the UK
   Singles Chart.^[9] In addition to a re-release of "Feel the Vibe" on
   Ministry of Sound, he has produced several club remixes, as well as his
   own productions, including "Get Over Here" by Rasmus Faber, "2 Million
   Ways" by C-Mos, "Turn On the Music" by Roger Sanchez, as well as his
   collaboration with Sebastian Ingrosso on Ernesto vs Bastian's "Dark
   Side of the Moon". Alongside his original productions, he collaborated
   with the Swedish producer Ingrosso on "Together". Axwell's most
   successful release of 2005 was "Watch the Sunrise", with Steve Edwards
   on vocals (famous for Cassius' "The Sound of Violence"). The track
   reached #3 in UK Dance Singles Chart and BBC Radio 1 Dance Chart. In
   between Axwell's productions he also found time to create Axtone, his
   own record label.

   In the spring of 2006, Axwell and Steve Angello, under the Supermode
   alias, remixed Bronski Beat's "Smalltown Boy", producing "Tell Me Why"
   which was released under the Data label. Later, he teamed up with Eric
   Prydz and produced the tracks 123 and 321 releasing them under the
   alias Axer. October saw Axwell make his DJ Mag entry at number 93.^[10]
   That same year, Axwell branched into a New York house sound with his
   mix of "Counting Down the Days", a song by Sunfreakz. Axwell ignored
   the vocals (sung by Andrea Britton) for his mix, which was a blend of
   cutting progressive-house sounds and ethereal keyboards. The Israeli DJ
   Offer Nissim featured the mix prominently during his set at the March
   2007 closing party for Manhattan's Roxy. In August 2007, Axwell teamed
   up with performer Max'C to create the track "I Found U", which made it
   to #6 in the UK Singles Chart. The 2007 DJ Mag polls saw Axwell climb
   60 places to number 33.^[11]

2008–2013: Swedish House Mafia[edit]

2007–2008: Group Formation, and continued solo work[edit]

   On 12 August 2007, Axwell, Steve Angello and Sebastian Ingrosso played
   the Main Room at Cream Amnesia under the alias The Swedish House Mafia
   as part of Radio 1's Essential Mix Ibiza. The group which officially
   formed in late 2008 had been performing shows like this for some time
   along with fellow Swedish DJ Eric Prydz however Prydz decided not to
   join the group, describing himself as a 'control freak' in the studio
   who can't abide collaboration, even with close friends.^[12] In 2007,
   the trio released their first single together, "Get Dumb", however this
   was credited under their individual names.

   In 2008, Axwell co-wrote and co-produced the song "Rain on Me" with
   Cyndi Lauper for her 2008 album Bring Ya to the Brink. During June of
   that year he released a song which was originally produced as a remix
   for David Guetta's "Everytime We Touch". Somehow, Guetta rejected the
   remix so Axwell took the instrumental of the song, teamed up with Bob
   Sinclar who brought in vocalist Ron Carroll and together they created
   "What a Wonderful World". In August, Axwell collaborated with an
   Australian DJ and producer, Dirty South, and released "Open Your
   Heart". At the same time, he also remixed "Hometown Glory" by Adele.
   The remix was released in two versions, "Original mix" with more vocals
   and more club oriented "Remode". October saw Axwell again climb the DJ
   Mag top 100 DJ poll with positions number 20.^[13]

2009–2010: Until One, and Axtone Vol.1[edit]

   In 2009, Axwell released "Leave the World Behind" with Swedish House
   Mafia. The song featured vocal from Deborah Cox and was again credited
   under the group's individual names. In 2009, Axwell chart number 14 on
   the DJ Mag poll.^[14] 2010 saw Swedish House Mafia release their first
   singles credited as such. The two singles, "One (Your Name)" (featuring
   Pharrell Williams) and "Miami 2 Ibiza" (featuring Tinie Tempah), were
   commercial successes becoming a top 20 hit in many European countries.
   These songs were featured on Swedish House Mafia's debut album Until
   One (released 25 October 2010) which acted as a studio and compilation
   album as it contained much of their own work (as a group and
   individually) as well as the work of other producers as well. On 13
   June 2010, Axwell released his own studio/compilation album entitled
   Axtone Vol.1.^[15] In 2010, Axwell achieved his highest position on the
   DJ Mag top 100 DJ poll, charting at number 10.^[16]

2011–2012: Until Now, Grammy Awards, and Album Production[edit]

   In February 2011, Axwell and Dirty South's remix of the song "Sweet
   Disposition" originally by The Temper Trap, received a nomination for
   the 53rd Grammy Awards in the category for Best Remixed Recording,
   Non-Classical. Meanwhile, in May, he released "Save the World" with the
   rest of the Swedish House Mafia. The song featured vocals from Swedish
   singer John Martin and has gained certifications across Europe
   including 5× Platinum in Sweden.^[17] The DJ Mag polls saw Axwell chart
   at number 12 this year.^[18] Towards the end of the year and the
   beginning of 2012, Axwell continue to work with Swedish House Mafia
   releasing two more singles "Antidote" and "Greyhound". He also worked
   with Flo Rida on the American's fourth studio album Wild Ones,
   co-producing two of its most successful singles "Wild Ones" and "Let It
   Roll".

   On 24 April 2012, Axwell released his remix of "In My Mind" by Ivan
   Gough and Feenixpawl featuring Georgi Kay on Beatport. It was nominated
   for the 55th Grammy Awards in the category of Best Remixed Recording,
   Non-Classical. In June, the release of Usher's Looking 4 Myself saw the
   second album which Axwell co-produced with the songs "Numb" and
   "Euphoria" with the latter receiving a remix from the entire Swedish
   House Mafia. In September, Swedish House Mafia released their most
   commercially successful song which again featured vocals from John
   Martin. "Don't You Worry Child" became a top 10 in many countries
   gaining muti-platinum awards in many also. This along with previous
   solo and group work from all Swedish House Mafia members featured on
   the trio's second and final album Until Now which was released on 22
   October 2012.

2013: One Last Tour and continued solo work[edit]

   In November 2012, Swedish House Mafia kicked off their One Last Tour
   after its announcement in June of that year. The supergroup stated that
   the final leg of this tour would be their last and the group would
   split up after its conclusion at Ultra Music Festival Miami 2013.
   Following the group's farewell, Axwell and fellow Swedish House Mafia
   member Sebastian Ingrosso announced their new night club at Ushuaïa,
   Ibiza, called "Departures". 2013 saw Axwell's new single "Center of the
   Universe" released for digital download with the song reaching number
   one on Beatport.^[19] His subsequent single, with Sick Individuals feat
   Taylr Renee, "I Am" was released on 16 September and also reached
   number one on Beatport.^[20] Remixes for "I Am" were released on 26
   January 2014 through Axwell's own Axtone label. Remixing artists
   included Deorro, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, Jacob Plant and
   Nu:Tone.^[21] 2013 saw Axwell climb positions in the DJ Mag top 100 DJ
   poll for the first time since 2010. He climbed 4 places from his 2012
   position achieve place 19.^[22] 2013 also saw Axwell collaborate with
   Sebastian Ingrosso on "Roar" for the Monsters University
   Soundtrack.^[23]

Career[edit]

Early career (2006 - 2008)[edit]

   Cornéer and Engblom had separate careers before they formed a duo and
   have released music individually since. Engblom used the moniker Phasio
   and released one album, Just One More Day in 2001.^[5]^[6] Cornéer used
   the name Dibaba and released Songs For Good Lives in 2005.^[7] Dada
   Life came into being in 2006 when the duo began releasing a number of
   12" singles. They included "Big Time" in May of that year through
   Breastfed Recordings.,^[6]^[8]^[9] "The Great Smorgasbord" in December
   on Southern Fried Records,^[10] coinciding with "The Great Fashionista
   Swindle" through Pickadoll Records.^[9]^[11] The duo began performing
   live notably in Germany and the UK.^[6]

   In May 2007, the duo released the 12" "Vote Yes",^[12]^[13] followed in
   October by "Fun, Fun, Fun",^[14] both through Prestel Records.^[15] The
   latter reached the Dutch and Belgian dance charts.^[16]^[17] In June
   "This Machine Kills Breakfasts" appeared through Alphabet
   City,^[18]^[19] while in December, they released "Sweeter Than Fever"
   through Pickadoll.^[20]

   In May 2008 they released the 12" "Your Favourite Flu" through
   U-Boot,^[21] followed by "Cash In Drop Out" on Big & Dirty In
   June.^[22] In December 2008 the 12" "Rubber Band Boogie" again on
   Pickadoll.^[23]

Just Do The Dada (2009 - 2011)[edit]

   In anticipation of their debut album, the duo released the single
   "Happy Hands & Happy Feet" through Big & Dirty in March 2009.^[24]^[25]
   It featured vocals by Anthony Mills and reached the Belgian
   charts.^[26] The duo released their first album Just Do The Dada in
   September 2009 through The:Hours.^[27] It featured vocal contributions
   by Anthony Mills, Bita Mazhoni and Anna Mourou.^[28] A second single
   from the album, "Let's Get Bleeped Tonight" was released in November
   and featured Bita Mazhoni. It also reached the Belgian charts.^[29] The
   third single from the album, " Love Vibrations" appeared in February
   2010 and failed to chart.^[30] In May 2010 the 12" "Cookies With A
   Smile" appeared, featuring Anthony Mills on vocals.^[31]

   Dada Life frequently headlines at North America's two largest
   electronic dance festivals, the Electric Daisy Carnival and Ultra Music
   Festival. At Electric Daisy Carnival 2011, Dada Life brought out a full
   marching band to perform their song "White Noise / Red Meat."^[32]

The Rules of Dada (2012-2016)[edit]

   In October 2012, Dada Life released their second full-length album, The
   Rules of Dada that reached the lower echelons of the Billboard
   200,^[33] and the top 20 of the UK Dance album chart.^[34] It included
   the singles "Feed The Dada" and "Kick Out the Epic Motherfucker", which
   both charted in Sweden.^[35]

   In fall 2012, Dada Life embarked on a tour of the same name, visiting
   over 40 cities in the US and Canada. In November 2013 the duo release
   "Born to Rage" that reached the chart in Belgium and Sweden.^[36]^[37]

   In March 2014 Engblom was forced to abandon performing due to a medical
   emergency.^[38] In September 2014, Cornéer was diagnosed with cancer
   and took a temporary absence from performing.^[39] In 2015 he released
   the album One under the name Night Gestalt.^[40] He has since been
   declared cancer-free.

   In December 2014, the duo engaged in a publicity stunt that allegedly
   concerned a lost MacBook Pro and a pair of headphones.^[41]^[42]
   Through social media accounts bearing the name Dada
   Death,^[43]^[44]^[45] a campaign for the single "Tonight We're Kids
   Again" was launched.^[46]^[47]^[48] In March 2015 they released the
   compilation mix Welcome To Dada Land.^[49]

   The duo collaborated with vocalist Lzzy Hale of Halestorm in February
   2016 for their single "Tic Tic Tic". In July 2016 they released "Red Is
   The Color Of Rage" that was described as "haunting and almost subdued",
   following it up with "Yellow Is The Color Of Happiness" soon
   after.^[50]

   They cite John Cage, Little Richard, Acid House and Trance as
   inspiration.^[51]

Our Nation (2017-present)[edit]

   In September 2017, Cornéer announced his intent to stop touring as part
   of Dada Life due to health concerns, but made it clear that his
   concerns had nothing to do with his 2014 cancer diagnosis. He continues
   to produce in-studio with Engblom.^[52]

   In November 2017, Dada Life released "We Want Your Soul", the first
   single from their then-untitled third studio album. In March 2018, the
   second single, "Higher Than The Sun", was released, along with the
   title of the album - Our Nation - and the announcement of a tour to
   support it. The album was released on May 4, 2018.^[53] Another single,
   "Do It Till Your Face Hurts", was released in March as well.^[54]

Collaborations[edit]

   In 2007 they released the song "We Meow, You Roar" on a split 12" with
   Rob Mooney through Substance.^[55]^[56] They have remixed "Dynasty" and
   "Llove" by Kaskade (feat. Haley), "Big Bad Wolf" by Duck Sauce, "Who Is
   Ready To Jump" by Chuckie, and "Prutataaa" by Afrojack and R3hab.

Name[edit]

   Dada Life is named after the Dada art movement in 20th century Europe.
   The avant-garde art movement formed from an artistic anarchy, fighting
   against the cultural, political, and social values of the time.^[57] In
   the same way, Dada Life and rave culture as a whole is a protest to
   return to the experience of the body and away from the capitalistic and
   rationalist dogma of today's society.^[citation needed]

Trivia[edit]

   On October 26, 2013, Dada Life broke the Guinness World Record for the
   world's largest pillow fight at a Dada Land Compound event at the
   Aragon Ballroom in Chicago and had 3,813 participants.^[58]^[59]

   On July 19, 2014 Dada Life debuted Dada Land: The Voyage, a
   mini-festival in San Bernardino, CA attended by over 10,000 fans where
   the duo arrived via hot air balloon.^[40]^[60]

   On July 19, 2015, Dada Life broke the Guinness World Record for the
   world's largest gathering of people dressed as fruit at Dada Land: The
   Voyage. The event was at San Manuel Amphitheater in Southern California
   and had 629 participants.^[61]

History[edit]

Early years (1997–2005)[edit]

   Hardcore Superstar formed in Gothenburg, Sweden in 1997. They released
   their first album, It's Only Rock 'n' Roll, on Gain Records in October
   1998. Out of the 11 tracks on the album (including the hidden track,
   Fly Away], 7 songs were re-recorded for their first worldwide release,
   Bad Sneakers and a Piña Colada. Released in 2000, Bad Sneakers
   contained 7 of the tracks from their debut, along with 6 new tracks.
   The Japan release for the album featured a bonus track, "Don't You Ever
   Leave Me", a cover of a Hanoi Rocks song. The album spawned three
   singles, all being #1 hits on the Swedish music charts; "Someone
   Special", "Liberation" and "Have You Been Around", respectively.

   The band toured Europe and Japan in support of the album, and a
   promotional video for the single "Liberation" was released. The video
   was nominated for a Swedish Grammy. In 2001, Hardcore Superstar
   released their third album called "Thank You (For Letting Us Be
   Ourselves)". The album had a more laid back feel than its predecessor
   and spawned two singles; "Shame" and "Mother's Love/Significant Other".

   In August 2003 the band released their final album with Music For
   Nations, entitled "No Regrets". This was also released in Japan as a
   "Limited Edition" album, featuring a completely different cover, and a
   bonus track, entitled "Who", a cover of a song by The Who. Two singles
   were released for the album, "Honey Tongue", which reached #3 on the
   Swedish charts, and "Still I'm Glad". Hardcore Superstar toured Europe
   and the United States in support of the album the following year.

Mainstream success (2005–2008)[edit]

   In 2005, Hardcore Superstar re-signed with Gain Records, the label with
   whom they released their debut with in 1998. The band returned
   rejuvenated, with a hard rock sound more comparable to their earlier
   works. They released a self-titled album Hardcore Superstar in 2005,
   which featured the Swedish hit singles; "We Don't Celebrate Sundays",
   "Wild Boys", "My Good Reputation" and "Bag On Your Head". The Japan
   release of this album contained a bonus track, entitled "GTO", which
   stood for "Girls Together Outrageously". This saw them nominated for a
   Swedish Grammy, as well as being on major national TV and radio shows
   in Sweden. They also toured Japan, along with the Swedish band, Babylon
   Bombs.

   In November 2007 the band released the album Dreamin' in a Casket. This
   was the last album to feature founding guitarist, Thomas Silver.
   Originally, it was meant to include the single "Bastards", but due to
   the success it achieved in the singles charts, it was shelved, although
   the Japan version of the album contained the song as a bonus track. The
   album was praised in the Swedish newspapers and was titled by many as
   "Album of the Year". Dreamin' in a Casket contains a more heavy guitar
   riff-based sound and includes more noticeable drumming. The album was
   also released as part of a CD/DVD combination, featuring the "Inside
   the Casket" documentary, which showed how the band recorded the album.
   The band toured around Europe and Japan, and ended their "Mentally
   Damaged Tour" in their home country of Sweden.

Departure of Silver and label change (2008–2011)[edit]

   In late January 2008, it was announced on the band's official website
   that guitarist Thomas Silver, would be leaving the band as he had "lost
   his fire and inspiration". Vic Zino, from Crazy Lixx, replaced him
   temporarily during the World Tour, but was later confirmed to be a
   permanent member of the band.

   In March 2009 the world's biggest Heavy Metal label, Nuclear Blast
   announced the signing of Hardcore Superstar. The seventh album by
   Hardcore Superstar, entitled Beg for It was released worldwide in June
   2009. It was released in Japan, and USA, with different bonus tracks.
   The Japan edition featured the bonus track "Silence for the Peacefully
   [Live]", a song released on the previous album, Dreamin' in a Casket.
   The USA release contained two demo songs, one being "Welcome to Your
   Own Death", and the other "When I Glow", a demo version of Need No
   Company, again, from the album Dreamin' in a Casket.

   Shortly after the Beg For It tour of the UK in 2010, Hardcore Superstar
   announced that they were planning to release a new album, as the tour
   had proved to trigger their creative minds, and as a result, new
   material was being recorded. On 12 April 2010 they announced four
   potential song titles from their upcoming album, being Last Call, Sick
   as a Dog, Won't Be Bullied and Sadistic Girls. On 19 May 2010 the band
   released the titles of four more potential songs from their upcoming
   album, being Lowlife, Beat On the Bully, Party Ain't Over ´til I Say So
   and Here Comes That Sick Bitch Again. Last Call, and presumably,
   judging by the chorus of the song, Party Ain't Over 'til I Say so, were
   changed to Last Call for Alcohol, Won't Be Bullied, and again,
   presumably, Beat on the Bully, were changed to Bully, and Sick as a Dog
   and Lowlife were left off the release. On 9 August 2010, Split Your Lip
   was announced as the title of the album, as well as a tentative release
   date, set for January 2011.

   The band released the album Split Your Lip on 26 November 2010, two
   months early than they planned. The album spawned one single,
   "Moonshine", a double A-side, featuring both "Moonshine" and
   "Guestlist", with a bonus track entitled "Lovin' the Dead". The single
   was released only through Sweden Rock magazine.

   When the band performed a free show in their hometown Gothenburg on 11
   August 2010, they played the songs "Here Comes That Sick Bitch Again",
   "Last Call for Alcohol" and "Sadistic Girls". It was the first time
   they played any material from the album.

Recent events (2011–present)[edit]

   On 30 August 2011 the band announced that they would be releasing a
   Best Of album, with a release date of 26 October. The album was to
   include songs from all releases, with a brand new song entitled "We
   Don't Need a Cure". The song premiered on Bandit Rock Radio on 31
   August 2011.

   On 30 October 2012 it was announced by both Gain and Vic Zino, the
   band's guitarist, that the new album would be called C'mon Take on Me.
   The debut single from the album, "One More Minute", was officially
   released on 17 January 2013. The album was released on 27 February
   2013.^[1]

   On 24 January 2015, after ten years of not being on American soil, the
   band performed a full headline set to a sold-out crowd at the Whisky a
   Go Go in West Hollywood, California. The night before, they also played
   a six-song opening set for Steel Panther at the 2015 NAMM Jam in
   Anaheim, California. They released a new album in North America in
   April 2015, entitled HCSS.^[2]

   Following the release of 2015's HCSS, the band embarked on a
   co-headlining UK and US tour with Michael Monroe in 2016.^[3]

Early life[edit]

   Axwell's interest in music appeared at an early age, having taught
   himself to play the drums by age nine. Four years later, the
   13-year-old exchanged his drums for a computer so he could create each
   element of his music independently.^[4] Axwell released limited copies
   of a techno/hard trance EP on vinyl under the name OXL in 1995.^[5]
   During his teenage years, he was also active in the tracking music
   scene under the moniker Quazar, releasing acid techno tracks made with
   FastTracker 2^[6] and NoiseTracker.^[7]

Career[edit]

1995–2003: Career beginnings[edit]

   Axwell began his career remixing songs by other artists, his first
   official remix being released in 2000. Some of his most notable early
   remixes include: Usher's "Burn" (BMG), Room 5's "Make Luv" (Positiva),
   Clipse & Faith Evans "Ma, I Don’t Love Her" (RCA), Stonebridge's "Put
   'em High" (Hed Kandi), N*E*R*D's single "Maybe" (Virgin), and more
   recently Hard-Fi's "Hard to Beat", Deep Dish's "Dreams", Pharrell's
   "Angel", Nelly Furtado's "Promiscuous" and Madonna's "Jump".

   Axwell has also been responsible for Jetlag's "So Right", which came
   out in September 2002 on Soulfuric, featuring the vocals of Noel McKoy
   and co-produced with Brian Tappert. In late 2002 Axwell went back to
   his roots and produced a track under his own name - "Lead Guitar" which
   was released by fellow Swede Stonebridge on his Stoney Boy imprint.

   Also leading the way has been Mambana, his collaboration with Isabel
   Fructuoso (of Afro Medusa fame).^[8] Signed to Soulfuric Recordings,
   they have released three tracks since 2002. "No Reason" was their debut
   single, which hit the top spot in all the Hype/Buzz charts that Summer
   and was featured in the sets of all the top DJs including Little Louie
   Vega, Danny Rampling and Ben Watt. The follow ups were "Felicidad" and
   "Libre". "Libre" was released in 2003 and was arguably bigger than its
   predecessor. "Libre" was licensed to more than 12 different territories
   and featured on compilations that sold in excess of half a million
   copies.

   2003 saw Axwell recording for London-based label suSU (the UK home of
   Masters at Work) under the guise of Starbeach. The track was called
   "Get Naked" & featured the vocal talents of D'Empress (from Mutiny).
   This was followed up by his version of Evelyn Thomas' classic "High
   Energy". In the autumn of 2003 Axwell's "Wait a Minute", featuring the
   vocals of Nevada, was released on Soulfuric's sub-label Device. This
   song was a club smash that gained support from the likes of Pete Tong,
   Junior Jack, Kid Creme.

2004–2007: Singles and breakthrough[edit]

   By late 2004, Axwell released "Feel the Vibe", which was re-released
   through Ministry of Sound in 2005 with new lead vocals from Tara
   McDonald who also wrote the song as "Feel the Vibe ('Til The Morning
   Comes)". McDonald's voice and writing helped secure the track as a
   radio winner and this track became one of the biggest cross over dance
   records of 2005. It was a breakthrough record for both Axwell & Tara
   McDonald. It peaked at #1 in UK Dance Singles Chart and #16 in the UK
   Singles Chart.^[9] In addition to a re-release of "Feel the Vibe" on
   Ministry of Sound, he has produced several club remixes, as well as his
   own productions, including "Get Over Here" by Rasmus Faber, "2 Million
   Ways" by C-Mos, "Turn On the Music" by Roger Sanchez, as well as his
   collaboration with Sebastian Ingrosso on Ernesto vs Bastian's "Dark
   Side of the Moon". Alongside his original productions, he collaborated
   with the Swedish producer Ingrosso on "Together". Axwell's most
   successful release of 2005 was "Watch the Sunrise", with Steve Edwards
   on vocals (famous for Cassius' "The Sound of Violence"). The track
   reached #3 in UK Dance Singles Chart and BBC Radio 1 Dance Chart. In
   between Axwell's productions he also found time to create Axtone, his
   own record label.

   In the spring of 2006, Axwell and Steve Angello, under the Supermode
   alias, remixed Bronski Beat's "Smalltown Boy", producing "Tell Me Why"
   which was released under the Data label. Later, he teamed up with Eric
   Prydz and produced the tracks 123 and 321 releasing them under the
   alias Axer. October saw Axwell make his DJ Mag entry at number 93.^[10]
   That same year, Axwell branched into a New York house sound with his
   mix of "Counting Down the Days", a song by Sunfreakz. Axwell ignored
   the vocals (sung by Andrea Britton) for his mix, which was a blend of
   cutting progressive-house sounds and ethereal keyboards. The Israeli DJ
   Offer Nissim featured the mix prominently during his set at the March
   2007 closing party for Manhattan's Roxy. In August 2007, Axwell teamed
   up with performer Max'C to create the track "I Found U", which made it
   to #6 in the UK Singles Chart. The 2007 DJ Mag polls saw Axwell climb
   60 places to number 33.^[11]

2008–2013: Swedish House Mafia[edit]

   photoshoot in 2012

2007–2008: Group Formation, and continued solo work[edit]

   On 12 August 2007, Axwell, Steve Angello and Sebastian Ingrosso played
   the Main Room at Cream Amnesia under the alias The Swedish House Mafia
   as part of Radio 1's Essential Mix Ibiza. The group which officially
   formed in late 2008 had been performing shows like this for some time
   along with fellow Swedish DJ Eric Prydz however Prydz decided not to
   join the group, describing himself as a 'control freak' in the studio
   who can't abide collaboration, even with close friends.^[12] In 2007,
   the trio released their first single together, "Get Dumb", however this
   was credited under their individual names.

   In 2008, Axwell co-wrote and co-produced the song "Rain on Me" with
   Cyndi Lauper for her 2008 album Bring Ya to the Brink. During June of
   that year he released a song which was originally produced as a remix
   for David Guetta's "Everytime We Touch". Somehow, Guetta rejected the
   remix so Axwell took the instrumental of the song, teamed up with Bob
   Sinclar who brought in vocalist Ron Carroll and together they created
   "What a Wonderful World". In August, Axwell collaborated with an
   Australian DJ and producer, Dirty South, and released "Open Your
   Heart". At the same time, he also remixed "Hometown Glory" by Adele.
   The remix was released in two versions, "Original mix" with more vocals
   and more club oriented "Remode". October saw Axwell again climb the DJ
   Mag top 100 DJ poll with positions number 20.^[13]

2009–2010: Until One, and Axtone Vol.1[edit]

   Axwell (centre) performing with Swedish House Mafia in Ibiza, 2011

   In 2009, Axwell released "Leave the World Behind" with Swedish House
   Mafia. The song featured vocal from Deborah Cox and was again credited
   under the group's individual names. In 2009, Axwell chart number 14 on
   the DJ Mag poll.^[14] 2010 saw Swedish House Mafia release their first
   singles credited as such. The two singles, "One (Your Name)" (featuring
   Pharrell Williams) and "Miami 2 Ibiza" (featuring Tinie Tempah), were
   commercial successes becoming a top 20 hit in many European countries.
   These songs were featured on Swedish House Mafia's debut album Until
   One (released 25 October 2010) which acted as a studio and compilation
   album as it contained much of their own work (as a group and
   individually) as well as the work of other producers as well. On 13
   June 2010, Axwell released his own studio/compilation album entitled
   Axtone Vol.1.^[15] In 2010, Axwell achieved his highest position on the
   DJ Mag top 100 DJ poll, charting at number 10.^[16]

2011–2012: Until Now, Grammy Awards, and Album Production[edit]

   In February 2011, Axwell and Dirty South's remix of the song "Sweet
   Disposition" originally by The Temper Trap, received a nomination for
   the 53rd Grammy Awards in the category for Best Remixed Recording,
   Non-Classical. Meanwhile, in May, he released "Save the World" with the
   rest of the Swedish House Mafia. The song featured vocals from Swedish
   singer John Martin and has gained certifications across Europe
   including 5× Platinum in Sweden.^[17] The DJ Mag polls saw Axwell chart
   at number 12 this year.^[18] Towards the end of the year and the
   beginning of 2012, Axwell continue to work with Swedish House Mafia
   releasing two more singles "Antidote" and "Greyhound". He also worked
   with Flo Rida on the American's fourth studio album Wild Ones,
   co-producing two of its most successful singles "Wild Ones" and "Let It
   Roll".

   On 24 April 2012, Axwell released his remix of "In My Mind" by Ivan
   Gough and Feenixpawl featuring Georgi Kay on Beatport. It was nominated
   for the 55th Grammy Awards in the category of Best Remixed Recording,
   Non-Classical. In June, the release of Usher's Looking 4 Myself saw the
   second album which Axwell co-produced with the songs "Numb" and
   "Euphoria" with the latter receiving a remix from the entire Swedish
   House Mafia. In September, Swedish House Mafia released their most
   commercially successful song which again featured vocals from John
   Martin. "Don't You Worry Child" became a top 10 in many countries
   gaining muti-platinum awards in many also. This along with previous
   solo and group work from all Swedish House Mafia members featured on
   the trio's second and final album Until Now which was released on 22
   October 2012.

2013: One Last Tour and continued solo work[edit]

   In November 2012, Swedish House Mafia kicked off their One Last Tour
   after its announcement in June of that year. The supergroup stated that
   the final leg of this tour would be their last and the group would
   split up after its conclusion at Ultra Music Festival Miami 2013.
   Following the group's farewell, Axwell and fellow Swedish House Mafia
   member Sebastian Ingrosso announced their new night club at Ushuaïa,
   Ibiza, called "Departures". 2013 saw Axwell's new single "Center of the
   Universe" released for digital download with the song reaching number
   one on Beatport.^[19] His subsequent single, with Sick Individuals feat
   Taylr Renee, "I Am" was released on 16 September and also reached
   number one on Beatport.^[20] Remixes for "I Am" were released on 26
   January 2014 through Axwell's own Axtone label. Remixing artists
   included Deorro, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, Jacob Plant and
   Nu:Tone.^[21] 2013 saw Axwell climb positions in the DJ Mag top 100 DJ
   poll for the first time since 2010. He climbed 4 places from his 2012
   position achieve place 19.^[22] 2013 also saw Axwell collaborate with
   Sebastian Ingrosso on "Roar" for the Monsters University
   Soundtrack.^[23]

2014: X4 and Governors Ball[edit]

   Axwell joined forces with Sebastian Ingrosso, debuting their new
   collective at the 2014 Governors Ball Music Festival in New York City -
   their new group named Axwell Λ Ingrosso,^[24] this followed the release
   of their debut EP X4.^[25] One of the songs from this EP, "We Come, We
   Rave, We Love", was the final version of a song started by Swedish
   House Mafia and was played frequently during their One Last Tour. A
   single, "Something New" was released from the EP in November of that
   year.^[26]

2015–2017: Single releases and solo work[edit]

   In the early months of 2015 Axwell released his second and third single
   under the Axwell Λ Ingrosso collaboration entitled "On My Way" and
   "Can't Hold Us Down" respectively.^[27]^[28] In June, the duo released
   their fourth single named "Sun Is Shining".^[29] This song became
   number 1 in Sweden^[30] and was Axwell's (and Ingrosso's) first number
   1 since "Don't You Worry Child". In July the duo headlined Tomorrowland
   closing Night Two.^[31]

   In November 2015, "This Time" was released under Axwell Λ Ingrosso^[32]

   In October 2012, Dada Life released their second full-length album, The
   Rules of Dada that reached the lower echelons of the Billboard
   200,^[33] and the top 20 of the UK Dance album chart.^[34] It included
   the singles "Feed The Dada" and "Kick Out the Epic Motherfucker", which
   both charted in Sweden.^[35]

   In fall 2012, Dada Life embarked on a tour of the same name, visiting
   over 40 cities in the US and Canada. In November 2013 the duo release
   "Born to Rage" that reached the chart in Belgium and Sweden.^[36]^[37]

   inspiration.^[51]

Our Nation (2017-present)[edit]

   In September 2017, Cornéer announced his intent to stop touring as part
   of Dada Life due to health concerns, but made it clear that his
   concerns had nothing to do with his 2014 cancer diagnosis. He continues
   to produce in-studio with Engblom.^[52]

   In November 2017, Dada Life released "We Want Your Soul", the first
   single from their then-untitled third studio album. In March 2018, the

   Rob Mooney through Substance.^[55]^[56] They have remixed "Dynasty" and
   "Llove" by Kaskade (feat. Haley), "Big Bad Wolf" by Duck Sauce, "Who Is
   Ready To Jump" by Chuckie, and "Prutataaa" by Afrojack and R3hab.

Name[edit]

   Dada Life is named after the Dada art movement in 20th century Europe.
   The avant-garde art movement formed from an artistic anarchy, fighting
   against the cultural, political, and social values of the time.^[57] In
   the same way, Dada Life and rave culture as a whole is a protest to
   return to the experience of the body and away from the capitalistic and
   rationalist dogma of today's society.^[citation needed]

Trivia[edit]

   On October 26, 2013, Dada Life broke the Guinness World Record for the
   world's largest pillow fight at a Dada Land Compound event at the
   Aragon Ballroom in Chicago and had 3,813 participants.^[58]^[59]

   On July 19, 2014 Dada Life debuted Dada Land: The Voyage, a
   mini-festival in San Bernardino, CA attended by over 10,000 fans where
   the duo arrived via hot air balloon.^[40]^[60]

   On July 19, 2015, Dada Life broke the Guinness World Record for the
   world's largest gathering of people dressed as fruit at Dada Land: The
   Voyage. The event was at San Manuel Amphitheater in Southern California
   and had 629 participants.^[61]

History[edit]

Early years (1997–2005)[edit]

   Hardcore Superstar formed in Gothenburg, Sweden in 1997. They released
   their first album, It's Only Rock 'n' Roll, on Gain Records in October
   1998. Out of the 11 tracks on the album (including the hidden track,
   Fly Away], 7 songs were re-recorded for their first worldwide release,
   Bad Sneakers and a Piña Colada. Released in 2000, Bad Sneakers
   contained 7 of the tracks from their debut, along with 6 new tracks.
   The Japan release for the album featured a bonus track, "Don't You Ever
   Leave Me", a cover of a Hanoi Rocks song. The album spawned three
   singles, all being #1 hits on the Swedish music charts; "Someone
   Special", "Liberation" and "Have You Been Around", respectively.

   The band toured Europe and Japan in support of the album, and a
   promotional video for the single "Liberation" was released. The video
   was nominated for a Swedish Grammy. In 2001, Hardcore Superstar
   released their third album called "Thank You (For Letting Us Be
   Ourselves)". The album had a more laid back feel than its predecessor
   and spawned two singles; "Shame" and "Mother's Love/Significant Other".

   In August 2003 the band released their final album with Music For
   Nations, entitled "No Regrets". This was also released in Japan as a
   "Limited Edition" album, featuring a completely different cover, and a
   bonus track, entitled "Who", a cover of a song by The Who. Two singles
   were released for the album, "Honey Tongue", which reached #3 on the
   Swedish charts, and "Still I'm Glad". Hardcore Superstar toured Europe
   and the United States in support of the album the following year.

Mainstream success (2005–2008)[edit]

   In 2005, Hardcore Superstar re-signed with Gain Records, the label with
   whom they released their debut with in 1998. The band returned
   rejuvenated, with a hard rock sound more comparable to their earlier
   works. They released a self-titled album Hardcore Superstar in 2005,
   which featured the Swedish hit singles; "We Don't Celebrate Sundays",
   "Wild Boys", "My Good Reputation" and "Bag On Your Head". The Japan
   release of this album contained a bonus track, entitled "GTO", which
   stood for "Girls Together Outrageously". This saw them nominated for a
   Swedish Grammy, as well as being on major national TV and radio shows
   in Sweden. They also toured Japan, along with the Swedish band, Babylon
   Bombs.

   In November 2007 the band released the album Dreamin' in a Casket. This
   was the last album to feature founding guitarist, Thomas Silver.
   Originally, it was meant to include the single "Bastards", but due to
   the success it achieved in the singles charts, it was shelved, although
   the Japan version of the album contained the song as a bonus track. The
   album was praised in the Swedish newspapers and was titled by many as
   "Album of the Year". Dreamin' in a Casket contains a more heavy guitar
   riff-based sound and includes more noticeable drumming. The album was
   also released as part of a CD/DVD combination, featuring the "Inside
   the Casket" documentary, which showed how the band recorded the album.
   The band toured around Europe and Japan, and ended their "Mentally
   Damaged Tour" in their home country of Sweden.

Departure of Silver and label change (2008–2011)[edit]

   In late January 2008, it was announced on the band's official website
   that guitarist Thomas Silver, would be leaving the band as he had "lost
   his fire and inspiration". Vic Zino, from Crazy Lixx, replaced him
   temporarily during the World Tour, but was later confirmed to be a
   permanent member of the band.

   In March 2009 the world's biggest Heavy Metal label, Nuclear Blast
   announced the signing of Hardcore Superstar. The seventh album by
   Hardcore Superstar, entitled Beg for It was released worldwide in June
   2009. It was released in Japan, and USA, with different bonus tracks.
   The Japan edition featured the bonus track "Silence for the Peacefully
   [Live]", a song released on the previous album, Dreamin' in a Casket.
   The USA release contained two demo songs, one being "Welcome to Your
   Own Death", and the other "When I Glow", a demo version of Need No
   Company, again, from the album Dreamin' in a Casket.

   Shortly after the Beg For It tour of the UK in 2010, Hardcore Superstar
   announced that they were planning to release a new album, as the tour
   had proved to trigger their creative minds, and as a result, new
   material was being recorded. On 12 April 2010 they announced four
   potential song titles from their upcoming album, being Last Call, Sick
   as a Dog, Won't Be Bullied and Sadistic Girls. On 19 May 2010 the band
   released the titles of four more potential songs from their upcoming
   album, being Lowlife, Beat On the Bully, Party Ain't Over ´til I Say So
   and Here Comes That Sick Bitch Again. Last Call, and presumably,
   judging by the chorus of the song, Party Ain't Over 'til I Say so, were
   changed to Last Call for Alcohol, Won't Be Bullied, and again,
   presumably, Beat on the Bully, were changed to Bully, and Sick as a Dog
   and Lowlife were left off the release. On 9 August 2010, Split Your Lip
   was announced as the title of the album, as well as a tentative release
   date, set for January 2011.

   The band released the album Split Your Lip on 26 November 2010, two
   months early than they planned. The album spawned one single,
   "Moonshine", a double A-side, featuring both "Moonshine" and
   "Guestlist", with a bonus track entitled "Lovin' the Dead". The single
   was released only through Sweden Rock magazine.

   When the band performed a free show in their hometown Gothenburg on 11
   August 2010, they played the songs "Here Comes That Sick Bitch Again",
   "Last Call for Alcohol" and "Sadistic Girls". It was the first time
   they played any material from the album.

Recent events (2011–present)[edit]

   On 30 August 2011 the band announced that they would be releasing a
   Best Of album, with a release date of 26 October. The album was to
   include songs from all releases, with a brand new song entitled "We
   Don't Need a Cure". The song premiered on Bandit Rock Radio on 31
   August 2011.

   On 30 October 2012 it was announced by both Gain and Vic Zino, the
   band's guitarist, that the new album would be called C'mon Take on Me.
   The debut single from the album, "One More Minute", was officially
   released on 17 January 2013. The album was released on 27 February
   2013.^[1]

   On 24 January 2015, after ten years of not being on American soil, the
   band performed a full headline set to a sold-out crowd at the Whisky a
   Go Go in West Hollywood, California. The night before, they also played
   a six-song opening set for Steel Panther at the 2015 NAMM Jam in
   Anaheim, California. They released a new album in North America in
   April 2015, entitled HCSS.^[2]

   Following the release of 2015's HCSS, the band embarked on a
   co-headlining UK and US tour with Michael Monroe in 2016.^[3]

Personal life[edit]

   Born in Nacka, Ingrosso is of Italian, Finnish, and Swedish descent and
   grew up in Stockholm, where he spent his teenage years in his
   choreographer father Vito Ingrosso's studio learning how to make
   music.^[1]

   Ingrosso is married to the singer and songwriter Kinnda and they have
   two daughters, Melina Ingrosso and Miranda Ingrosso. The couple have
   been married since 2011.^[2]

   He is also a cousin of musician Benjamin Ingrosso and social influencer
   Bianca Ingrosso.^[3]

Career[edit]

1999-2007: Career Beginnings[edit]

   Sebastian Ingrosso entered the music industry in 1999 releasing his
   first remix through Mega Records. Since then, he continued to release
   many remixes and singles. In 2003 Sebastian Ingrosso founded his own
   record label - Refune Music. In later years Ingrosso found himself
   collaborating mostly with fellow Swedish DJs Axwell, Steve Angello, and
   Eric Prydz - these four to be dubbed the Swedish House Mafia.

2008-2010: Until One, Collaborations, and DJ Mag entry[edit]

   In late 2008, Sebastian Ingrosso, Steve Angello, and Axwell formed the
   Swedish House Mafia with Eric Prydz not joining, saying he is a control
   freak and cannot abide with collaborations even with close friends.^[4]
   Around this time Swedish House Mafia released two songs, "Get Dumb" and
   "Leave the World Behind", however these weren't credited under the
   group name. Ingrosso himself collaborated with David Guetta on the
   songs "Everytime We Touch" and "How Soon is Now" for Guetta's albums
   Pop Life and One Love respectively. In 2009 Ingrosso made his debut on
   the DJ Mag top 100 DJs, charting at number 25, the highest new entry
   that year.^[5] In 2010, he released his debut album with Swedish House
   Mafia named Until One. This followed the release of two success single
   "One (Your Name)" (featuring Pharrell Williams) and "Miami 2 Ibiza"
   (featuring Tinie Tempah). The album also contained solo work by
   Sebastian Ingrosso such as the songs "Kidos" and "Meich", plus his
   remix of "Silvia" by Miike Snow. In addition, Ingrosso made his

Biography[edit]

   Maggio at Stavernfestivalen in 2016

   Veronica Sandra Karin Maggio^[1] was born on 15 March 1981 in Uppsala,
   Sweden,^[2] to a Swedish mother and an Italian father.^[3] She attended
   Uppsala Musikklasser primary school and went on to study music at
   Bolandgymnasiet (Boland highschool) in Uppsala and was also the lead
   singer of the group Solitude, with other members Daniel Fredriksson,
   Marcus "Gonzo" Berglund, Karl Jansson, and Kristoffer Hoflund.

   In October 2010, Maggio had a son with Nils Tull of the band
   Hoffmaestro & Chraa.^[4]

Music career[edit]

2006–07: Vatten och bröd[edit]

   In March 2006, Maggio released her debut single "Dumpa mig" (Dump Me);
   the video for the single soon became the hit of the week on TV stations
   like ZTV. Her second single was the song "Nöjd?" (Satisfied?). She
   signed a contract with Universal Music and went on a tour in Summer
   2006 as part of Sommarkrysset, a Swedish live-music program on TV4.

   Maggio's debut album is called Vatten och bröd (Water and Bread). The
   lyrics and music were written by Stefan Gräslund, except for the rap
   verse in "Vi har, vi har" (We Have, We Have), which was written by
   rapper Kristoffer Malmsten (known as LKM). “I started writing in
   English when I was really young, but I just wasn’t good enough.” she
   said in 2016, “I was mimicking things I’d heard and I wasn’t able to
   find my own identity.”^[5]

2008–10: Och vinnaren är...[edit]

   On 26 March 2008, Maggio released another album – Och vinnaren är...
   (And the Winner Is...), which she wrote and recorded together with
   Oskar Linnros.^[6]

   In 2009 she enjoyed some success in Norway and Denmark with her single
   "Måndagsbarn" (Monday child) reaching 1st position at the Norwegian
   charts,^[7] as well as being A-listed on the Norwegian radio station
   NRK P3, and the album Och vinnaren är... broke into the top 40 albums
   list.

   In 2010 Maggio worked with Petter on his new single "Längesen" (Long
   Time ago) from his album "En räddare i nöden" (A saviour when in need).

2011–12: Satan i gatan[edit]

   In 2011 she released the album Satan i gatan, on which she collaborated
   with amongst others Christian Walz and Markus Krunegård. The album was
   a success and reached the 1st place in both Swedish and Norwegian music
   charts, as did the single "Jag kommer". During the summer and autumn of
   2011, Maggio toured through Denmark, Norway and Sweden,^[8] and again
   in 2012 at Ruisrockfestival in Finland.

2013–present[edit]

   On 4 October 2013, Maggio released her fourth album, Handen i fickan
   fast jag bryr mig, which is produced by Salem Al Fakir, Vincent Pontare
   and Magnus Lidehäll. The album includes a duet with Swedish singer
   Håkan Hellström, "Hela huset".

   She released her fifth album, Den första är alltid gratis (The First
   One's Always Free) in 2016. A critic describes it as "another pop
   triumph, combining pacing, urgent melodies, with uplifting, hook-heavy
   choruses."^[9] Maggio said in an interview: “I really like the
   happy/sad combination.” “There’s a lot of melancholy in it, but there’s
   also something euphoric… I tended to write darker lyrics because it was
   always nighttime. I was still in the process of playing live lots, so I
   sort of surprised myself."

Awards[edit]

   Maggio has won many Swedish music awards. In 2007 she received "Årets
   Nykomling" (Newcomer of the year) at the Grammisgalan.^[10]

   In 2011 Maggio won the Rockbjörnen (rock bear) prize for both "Årets
   kvinnliga liveartist" (Live female artist of the year) and "Årets
   svenska låt" (Swedish song of the year) which was presented by Swedish
   newspaper Aftonbladet.^[11]

   At the 2012 Grammisgalan Maggio was named winner in the categories
   "Årets pop" (Pop of the year), "Årets kompositör" (composer of the
   year) and "Årets textförfattare" (Lyricist of the year).^[12] The
   latter two were won together with Christian Walz.

   French artist Vianney wrote a song about Maggio titled "Veronica".^[13]

   and Norse folklore. A number of their recent songs also contain
   references to J. R. R. Tolkien. Unleashed (along with Dismember,
   Entombed and Grave) is considered one of the "big four" of Swedish
   death metal.^[1]^[2]

Biography[edit]

   Unleashed was founded in 1989 by vocalist and bassist Johnny Hedlund.
   Unleashed recorded demos "Revenge" and "Utter Dark", which got them a
   record deal with the German label Century Media Records. In 1991, the
   band released their debut studio album, Where No Life Dwells, and
   toured with Morbid Angel in Europe and the United States.

   In 1992, Unleashed released their second studio album, Shadows in the
   Deep, including a cover version of Venom's "Countess Bathory". Their
   next studio albums were Across the Open Sea in 1993 and Victory in
   1995, the latter being the last album which guitarist Fredrik Lindgren
   played on. Lindgren began to focus strongly on playing punk rock, so
   Unleashed replaced him with Fredrik Folkare, who played guitar on the
   fifth Unleashed studio album Warrior in 1997.
   Bassist/vocalist Johnny Hedlund, founder of the band

   The band went on hiatus after 7–8 years of recording and touring. They
   were concentrating on life outside the music business, their musical
   side projects, and studying. After a reissue of the band's classics in
   2002, the band released a new album called Hell's Unleashed in the same
   year, and they began to tour once again. This was also the same year
   Hedlund had come under scrutiny because of allegations that he was a
   Nazi sympathizer. Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters initially had intended to
   approach Hedlund, hoping he would contribute lead vocals to one of the
   songs for his Probot metal project, but the album producer, Matt
   Sweeney, discouraged him from doing so because of the rumors of
   Hedlund's alleged sympathies.^[3] Hedlund quickly branded these
   accusations as false and stated, Unleashed praises nature, beast and
   man. Man....regardless of background, place of birth or color of the
   skin.^[4]^[5]

   In 2004, Unleashed released their seventh studio album, Sworn
   Allegiance. In October 2006, the band released their eighth studio
   album, Midvinterblot. Unleashed toured Europe in November 2006 as part
   of the Masters of Death tour, with Grave, Dismember, and Entombed. On
   February and March 2007, they headlined a North American tour with
   Krisiun and Belphegor. June 2008 saw the release of their ninth studio
   album entitled Hammer Battalion.

   On July 24, 2009 Unleashed signed a contract with German label Nuclear
   Blast Records for the release of their tenth album entitled As
   Yggdrasil Trembles. In the press statement the band said, "We are very
   much looking forward to this new cooperation! The recording of the
   album is scheduled for October/November this year."^[6]

   In summer 2010 Unleashed was part of the Summer Breeze Open Air and the
   With Full Force heavy metal festivals in Germany.^[7] The band's 11th
   studio album Odalheim was released also on Nuclear Blast Records in
   April 2012, and their twelfth record Dawn of the Nine was released
   April 24, 2015.

Biography[edit]

1987–1998[edit]

   Born in Hovmantorp, in the southern Swedish province Småland, at the
   age of thirteen Perrelli joined a local dansband, Bengt Ingvars,^[2]
   which became "Bengt Ingvars med Charlotte".^[2] After finishing her
   compulsory school education, Perrelli moved from Hovmantorp to the
   neighbouring town of Växjö where she attended the High School of
   Performing Arts.^[3] She also became the lead singer of a band named
   Kendix.^[4]

   In 1994, Perrelli started singing with the well-established dansband
   Anders Engbergs. After two albums, Perrelli left them and joined the
   highly successful Wizex in 1997.^[4] Larger venues and professional
   management increased the band's reputation. In 1998, the band was
   nominated for a Swedish Grammis (Grammy) for the album Mot nya mål, and
   the album Tusen och en natt that went gold.^[5]

   From 1997 to 1998 Perrelli starred as the instructor Millan Svensson in
   the Swedish soap opera Vita lögner.^[6]

1999–2000[edit]

   After winning that year's national Melodifestivalen, Perrelli went to
   Jerusalem to compete as the Swedish representative for the 1999
   Eurovision Song Contest on 29 May with her song "Take Me to Your
   Heaven".^[4]^[7] She won the contest with 163 points, making her the
   fourth Swedish representative to win the competition since Carola
   Häggkvist's victory in 1991, the Herreys brothers' in 1984 and ABBA's
   in 1974.^[8]^[9]

   Following her Eurovision success, she toured Europe and the Middle
   East, promoting her winning song. She also started working on her first
   solo album, Charlotte.^[10] Later that year, Perrelli was voted
   Sweden's sexiest woman by the magazine Café. She later released "I
   Write You a Lovesong", together with debut album Charlotte, which was
   well received.

   She did not appear at the Eurovision Song Contest 2000 due to a
   conflict between her and Sveriges Television.^[11]

2001–2003[edit]

   In 2001 she released her second album, Miss Jealousy, a pop/rock album
   which included the top-20 hit single "You Got Me Going Crazy", written
   by Mårten Sandén, Johan Åberg and Paul Rein^[12] as well as the radio
   hit "Light of My Life". Following the release, she promoted the album
   throughout Europe and New Zealand.^[13]^[14]

   Perrelli hosted the first semi-final of Melodifestivalen 2003 with Mark
   Levengood and Lena Philipsson.^[15] In April 2003 she performed in
   Jesus Christ Superstar in Stockholm. In September she released a new
   single, "Broken Heart", which was followed up by the album Gone Too
   Long in June 2004. The album contained songs such as "Gone Too Long",
   "Flashdance" and "Million Miles Away".^[16]

2004–2007[edit]

   After the success in Melodifestivalen 2003, Perrelli was once again
   asked to host Melodifestivalen 2004.^[17] Perrelli, Peter Settman and
   Ola Lindholm ended up hosting the entire tour together. After the
   festival, Swedish TV4 offered her own show on the channel,^[17] Super
   Troupers, a talent-show for kids.^[18]

   In mid-2004 she released her, until then, most successful album, Gone
   Too Long, which included songs by some of Sweden's top producers,
   including Jörgen Elofsson.^[19] The album topped the Swedish top for
   weeks and contained hits such as "A Million Miles Away" and "Gone Too
   Long". In the summer, she joined Robert Wells, Jill Johnson and others
   on the Rhapsody in Rock-tour in mid-2004.^[20] In the spring of 2005,
   she was a judge on Inför Eurovision, a TV show which previewed that
   year's Eurovision songs.^[21]

   In 2006, she released the album I din röst, in honour of the famous
   jazz singer Monica Zetterlund, which covered Zetterlund's most famous
   songs, along with some personal favorites and the soul ballad "I din
   röst", the title song written by Perrelli for the album.^[22] The album
   was successful, and she performed many of the songs in Sweden's top
   shows such as Allsång på Skansen and Nationaldagen. She also co-hosted
   the TV show Tillsammans för världens barn in October, where she also
   performed "The Greatest Love of All".^[23]

   In May 2007 Perrelli was the Swedish expert in the Nordic preview show
   panel discussion about the Eurovision Song Contest.^[24] In mid-2007
   Perrelli toured Sweden with Diggiloo. She was joined by singers such as
   Linda Bengtzing, Lasse Holm, Molly Sandén, Lotta Engberg and Jan
   Johansen.^[25] During the summer she released the love ballad "Som du"
   which she performed at the popular show Sommarkrysset.^[26] During the

   to 2012.^[37] Perrelli recorded a new single for the Swedish Royal
   Wedding in June 2010 together with pop singer Magnus Carlsson titled
   "Mitt livs gemål", which was very well received and performed
   throughout Sweden.^[38] In August, she released a fitness book titled

Personal life[edit]

   In 2003, Perrelli married Stockholm-based Swedish–Italian restaurateur

   Emilio was married to another Swedish singer, Pernilla Wahlgren, and
   the couple have a son who is also a singer, Benjamin, while his second
   brother Vito also has a son, Sebastian, former member of Swedish House
   Mafia; following a disagreement with Ingrosso's family, Charlotte and
