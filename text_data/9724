   The Coq Workshop series brings together Coq users, developers, and
   contributors. While conferences like ITP provide a venue for
   traditional research papers, the Coq Workshop focuses on strengthening
   the Coq community and providing a forum for discussing practical
   issues, including the future of the Coq software and its associated
   ecosystem of libraries and tools. Thus, the workshop will be organized
   around informal presentations and discussions, supplemented with
   invited talks.

   The Coq Workshop 2018 is a part of  FLoC 2018.

Submission Instructions

   We invite all members of the Coq community to propose informal talks,
   discussion sessions, or any potential uses of the day allocated to the
   workshop. Relevant subject matter includes but is not limited to:
     * Language or tactic features
     * Theory and implementation of the Calculus of Inductive
       Constructions
     * Applications and experience in education and industry
     * Tools and platforms built on Coq
     * Plugins and libraries for Coq
     * Interfacing with Coq
     * Formalization tricks and Coq pearls

   Authors should submit short proposals through EasyChair. Submissions
   should be in portable document format (PDF). Proposals should not
   exceed 2 pages in length in single-column full-page style.

   We are open to many ideas on how to use the workshop time. Some
   suggestions to drive proposals include sessions on tool demonstrations
   or lessons learned from teaching Coq.
