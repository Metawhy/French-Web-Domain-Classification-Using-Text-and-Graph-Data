Privacy Policy

1. An overview of data protection

General information

   The following information will provide you with an easy to navigate
   overview of what will happen with your personal data when you visit our
   website. The term “personal data” comprises all data that can be used
   to personally identify you. For detailed information about the subject
   matter of data protection, please consult our Data Protection
   Declaration, which we have included beneath this copy.

Data recording on our website

Who is the responsible party for the recording of data on this website (i.e.
the “controller”)?

   The data on this website is processed by the operator of the website,
   whose contact information is available under section “Information
   Required by Law” on this website.

How do we record your data?

   We collect your data as a result of your sharing of your data with us.
   This may, for instance be information you enter into our contact form.

   Our IT systems automatically record other data when you visit our
   website. This data comprises primarily technical information (e.g. web
   browser, operating system or time the site was accessed). This
   information is recorded automatically when you access our website.

What are the purposes we use your data for?

   A portion of the information is generated to guarantee the error free
   provision of the website. Other data may be used to analyse your user
   patterns.

What rights do you have as far as your information is concerned?

   You have the right to receive information about the source, recipients
   and purposes of your archived personal data at any time without having
   to pay a fee for such disclosures. You also have the right to demand
   that your data are rectified, blocked or eradicated. Please do not
   hesitate to contact us at any time under the address disclosed in
   section “Information Required by Law” on this website if you have
   questions about this or any other data protection related issues. You
   also have the right to log a complaint with the competent supervising
   agency.

   Moreover, under certain circumstances, you have the right to demand the
   restriction of the processing of your personal data. For details,
   please consult the Data Protection Declaration under section “Right to
   Restriction of Data Processing.”

Analysis tools and tools provided by third parties

   There is a possibility that your browsing patterns will be
   statistically analysed when your visit our website. Such analyses are
   performed primarily with cookies and with what we refer to as analysis
   programmes. As a rule, the analyses of your browsing patterns are
   conducted anonymously; i.e. the browsing patterns cannot be traced back
   to you. You have the option to object to such analyses or you can
   prevent their performance by not using certain tools. For detailed
   information about this, please consult our Data Protection Declaration
   below.

   You do have the option to object to such analyses. We will brief you on
   the objection options in this Data Protection Declaration.

2. General information and mandatory information

Data protection

   The operators of this website and its pages take the protection of your
   personal data very seriously. Hence, we handle your personal data as
   confidential information and in compliance with the statutory data
   protection regulations and this Data Protection Declaration.

   Whenever you use this website, a variety of personal information will
   be collected. Personal data comprises data that can be used to
   personally identify you. This Data Protection Declaration explains
   which data we collect as well as the purposes we use this data for. It
   also explains how, and for which purpose the information is collected.

   We herewith advise you that the transmission of data via the Internet
   (i.e. through e-mail communications) may be prone to security gaps. It
   is not possible to completely protect data against third party access.

Information about the responsible party (referred to as the “controller” in
the GDPR)

   The data processing controller on this website is:

   TYPO3 Association
   Herr Olivier Dobberkau / President
   Sihlbruggstrasse 105
   CH 6340 Baar

   Telephone: +41 41 511 00 35
   Email: info(at)typo3.org

   The controller is the natural person or legal entity that
   single-handedly or jointly with others makes decisions as to the
   purposes of and resources for the processing of personal data (e.g.
   names, e-mail addresses, etc.).

Revocation of your consent to the processing of data

   A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject
   to your express consent. You can also revoke at any time any consent
   you have already given us. To do so, all you are required to do is sent
   us an informal notification via e-mail. This shall be without prejudice
   to the lawfulness of any data collection that occurred prior to your
   revocation.

Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to object
to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)

   In the event that data are processed on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1
   lit. e or f GDPR, you have the right to at any time object to the
   processing of your personal data based on grounds arising from your
   unique situation. This also applies to any profiling based on these
   provisions. To determine the legal basis, on which any processing of
   data is based, please consult this Data Protection Declaration. If you
   log an objection, we will no longer process your affected personal
   data, unless we are in a position to present compelling protection
   worthy grounds for the processing of your data, that outweigh your
   interests, rights and freedoms or if the purpose of the processing is
   the claiming, exercising or defence of legal entitlements (objection
   pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 1 GDPR).

   If your personal data is being processed in order to engage in direct
   advertising, you have the right to at any time object to the processing
   of your affected personal data for the purposes of such advertising.
   This also applies to profiling to the extent that it is affiliated with
   such direct advertising. If you object, your personal data will
   subsequently no longer be used for direct advertising purposes
   (objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 2 GDPR).

Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency

   In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to
   log a complaint with a supervisory agency, in particular in the member
   state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at
   the place where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a
   complaint is in effect regardless of any other administrative or court
   proceedings available as legal recourses.

Right to data portability

   You have the right to demand that we hand over any data we
   automatically process on the basis of your consent or in order to
   fulfil a contract be handed over to you or a third party in a commonly
   used, machine readable format. If you should demand the direct transfer
   of the data to another controller, this will be done only if it is
   technically feasible.

SSL and/or TLS encryption

   For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential
   content, such as purchase orders or inquiries you submit to us as the
   website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption
   programme. You can recognise an encrypted connection by checking
   whether the address line of the browser switches from “http://” to
   “https://” and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser
   line.

   If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us
   cannot be read by third parties.

Encrypted payment transactions on this website

   If you are under an obligation to share your payment information (e.g.
   account number if you give us the authority to debit your bank account)
   with us after you have entered into a fee-based contract with us, this
   information is required to process payments.

   Payment transactions using common modes of paying (Visa/MasterCard,
   debit to your bank account) are processed exclusively via encrypted SSL
   or TLS connections. You can recognise an encrypted connection by
   checking whether the address line of the browser switches from
   “http://” to “https://” and also by the appearance of the lock icon in
   the browser line.

   If the communication with us is encrypted, third parties will not be
   able to read the payment information you share with us.

Information about, blockage, rectification and eradication of data

   Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the
   right to at any time demand information about your archived personal
   data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the
   processing of your data. You may also have a right to have your data
   rectified, blocked or eradicated. If you have questions about this
   subject matter or any other questions about personal data, please do
   not hesitate to contact us at any time at the address provided in
   section “Information Required by Law.”

Right to demand processing restrictions

   You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as
   the processing of your personal data is concerned. To do so, you may
   contact us at any time at the address provided in section “Information
   Required by Law.” The right to demand restriction of processing applies
   in the following cases:
     * In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data
       archived by us, we will usually need some time to verify this
       claim. During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have
       the right to demand that we restrict the processing of your
       personal data.
     * If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an
       unlawful manner, you have the option to demand the restriction of
       the processing of your data in lieu of demanding the eradication of
       this data.
     * If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to
       exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements, you have the right to
       demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data
       instead of its eradication.
     * If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 1 GDPR,
       your rights and our rights will have to be weighed against each
       other. As long as it has not been determined whose interests
       prevail, you have the right to demand a restriction of the
       processing of your personal data.

   If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data
   – with the exception of their archiving – may be processed only subject
   to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal entitlements or
   to protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for
   important public interest reasons cited by the European Union or a
   member state of the EU.

   provided in the contact form as well as any contact information
   provided therein will be stored by us in order to handle your inquiry
   and in the event that we have further questions. We will not share this

   revocation.

   The information you have entered into the contact form shall remain
   with us until you ask us to eradicate the data, revoke your consent to
   the archiving of data or if the purpose for which the information is
   being archived no longer exists (e.g. after we have concluded our
   response to your inquiry). This shall be without prejudice to any
   mandatory legal provisions – in particular retention periods.

Registration on this website

   You have the option to register on our website to be able to use
   additional website functions. We shall use the data you enter only for
   the purpose of using the respective offer or service you have

   shall be deleted. This shall be without prejudice to mandatory
   statutory retention obligations.

The comment function on this website

   When you use the comment function on this website, information on the
   time the comment was generated and, if you are not posting anonymously,
   the user name you have selected will be archived in addition to your
   comments.

Subscribing to comments

   As a user of this website, you have the option to subscribe to comments
   after you have registered. You will receive a confirmation e-mail, the
   purpose of which is to verify whether you are the actual holder of the
   provided e-mail address. You can deactivate this function at any time
   by following a respective link in the information e-mails. The data
   entered in conjunction with subscriptions to comments will be deleted
   in this case. However, if you have communicated this information to us
   for other purposes and from a different location (e.g. when subscribing
   to the newsletter), the data shall remain in our possession.

Storage period for comments

   Comments and any affiliated information (e.g. the IP address) shall be
   stored by us and remain on our website until the content the comment
   pertained to has been deleted in its entirety or if the comments had to
   be deleted for legal reasons (e.g. insulting comments).

Legal basis

   Comments are stored on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a
   GDPR). You have the right to revoke at any time any consent you have
   already given us. To do so, all you are required to do is sent us an
   informal notification via e-mail. This shall be without prejudice to
   the lawfulness of any data collection that occurred prior to your
   revocation.

Processing of data (customer and contract data)

   We collect, process and use personal data only to the extent necessary
   for the establishment, content organization or change of the legal
   relationship (data inventory). These actions are taken on the basis of
   Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. b GDPR, which permits the processing of data for
   the fulfilment of a contract or pre-contractual actions. We collect,
   process and use personal data concerning the use of our website (usage
   data) only to the extent that this is necessary to make it possible for
   users to utilize the services and to bill for them.

   The collected customer data shall be eradicated upon completion of the
   order or the termination of the business relationship. This shall be
   without prejudice to any statutory retention mandates.

Data transfer upon closing of contracts for services and digital content

   We share personal data with third parties only if this is necessary in
   conjunction with the handling of the contract; for instance, with the
   financial institution tasked with the processing of payments.

   Any further transfer of data shall not occur or shall only occur if you
   have expressly consented to the transfer. Any sharing of your data with
   third parties in the absence of your express consent, for instance for
   advertising purposes, shall not occur.

   The basis for the processing of data is Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. b GDPR,
   which permits the processing of data for the fulfilment of a contract
   or for pre-contractual actions.

5. Social media

Facebook plug-ins (Like & Share button)

   We have integrated plug-ins of the social network Facebook, provided by
   Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, California 94025, USA, on our
   website. You will be able to recognise Facebook plug-ins by the
   Facebook logo or the "Like" button on our website. An overview of the
   Facebook plug-ins is available under the following
   link: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/.

   Whenever you visit our website and its pages, the plug-in will
   establish a direct connection between your browser and the Facebook
   server. As a result, Facebook will receive the information that you
   have visited our website with your plug-in. However, if you click the
   Facebook “Like” button while you are logged into your Facebook account,
   you can link the content of our website and its pages with your
   Facebook profile. As a result, Facebook will be able to allocate the
   visit to our website and its pages to your Facebook user account. We
   have to point out, that we as the provider of the website do not have
   any knowledge of the transferred data and its use by Facebook. For more
   detailed information, please consult the Data Privacy Declaration of
   Facebook at: https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation.

   If you do not want Facebook to be able to allocate your visit to our
   website and its pages to your Facebook user account, please log out of
   your Facebook account while you are on our website.

   The use of the Facebook plug-in is based on Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR.
   The operator of the website has a legitimate interest in being as
   visible as possible on social media.

Twitter plug-in

   We have integrated functions of the social media platform Twitter into
   our website. These functions are provided by Twitter Inc., 1355 Market
   Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA. While you use Twitter
   and the "Re-Tweet" function, websites you visit are linked to your
   Twitter account and disclosed to other users. During this process, data
   are transferred to Twitter as well. We must point out, that we, the
   providers of the website and its pages do not know anything about the
   content of the data transferred and the use of this information by
   Twitter. For more details, please consult Twitter’s Data Privacy
   Declaration at: https://twitter.com/en/privacy.

   The use of Twitter plug-ins is based on Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR. The
   operator of the website has a legitimate interest in being as visible
   as possible on social media.

   You have the option to reset your data protection settings on Twitter
   under the account settings at https://twitter.com/account/settings.

Google+ plug-in

   Our website and its pages use functions of Google+; the provider is
   Google Ireland Limited (“Google”), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin
   4, Ireland.

   Recording and sharing of information: With the assistance of the
   Google+ button, you can publish information worldwide. The Google+
   button provides you and other users with custom tailored Google content
   as well as content of our partners. Google saves the information you
   have entered for content with +1 as well as information about the
   website/page you viewed when you clicked on +1. Your +1 entries may
   appear as information along with your profile name and your photo on
   Google services, such as in search results or in your Google profile or
   in other locations on websites and ads on the Internet.

   Google records information about your +1 activities to improve Google’s
   services for you and others. To be able to use the Google+ button, you
   will need a public Google profile, which is visible around the world,
   which must contain at least the name you have chosen for your profile.
   This name is used in conjunction with all Google services. In some
   cases, this name may also replace another name you have used when
   sharing content via your Google account. The identity of your Google
   profile may be displayed to users who know your e-mail address or are
   in possession of other information related to you that identifies you.

   Use of the recorded information: Besides the abovementioned purposes of
   use, the information you provide is also used in compliance with the
   applicable Google Data Privacy Policies. Google may potentially publish
   summary statistics about the +1 activities of its users or shares this
   information with users and partners, such as publishers, prospective
   customers or affiliated websites.

   The use of the Google+ plug-in is based on Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR.
   The operator of the website has a legitimate interest in being as
   visible as possible on social media.

6. Analysis tools and advertising

Matomo (formerly called Piwik)

   This website uses the open source web analysis service Matomo. Matomo
   uses so-called “cookies,” which are text files that are stored on your
   computer and that make it possible to analyse your use of this website.
   In conjunction with this, the information about the use of this website
   generated by the cookie will be archived on our server. Prior to
   archiving, the IP address will first be anonymized.

   Matomo cookies will remain on your device until you delete them.

   The storage of Matomo cookies and the use of this analysis tool are
   based on Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a
   legitimate interest in the analysis of user patterns, in order to
   optimize the operator’s web offerings and advertising.

   The information generated by cookies concerning the use of this website
   shall not be shared with any third parties. You may prevent the storage
   of cookies at any time by making pertinent changes to your browser
   software settings; however, we have to point out that in this case you
   may not be able to use all of the functions of this website to their
   fullest extent.

   If you do not consent to the storage and use of your data, you have the
   option to deactivate the storage and use of such data here. In this
   case, an opt out cookie will be placed in our browser, which prevent
   the storage of usage data by Matomo. If you delete your cookies, this
   will also result in the deletion of the Matomo opt out cookie. Hence,
   you will have to reactivate the opt out when you return to visit our
   website.

   Opt out Matomo tracking

Google Analytics Remarketing

   Our websites use the functions of Google Analytics Remarketing in
   combination with the functions of Google AdWords and Google
   DoubleClick, which work on all devices. The provider of these solutions
   is Google Ireland Limited (“Google”), Gordon House, Barrow Street,
   Dublin 4, Ireland.

   This function makes it possible to connect the advertising target
   groups generated with Google Analytics Remarketing with the functions
   of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick, which work on all devices.
   This makes it possible to display interest-based customized advertising
   messages, depending on your prior usage and browsing patterns on a
   device (e.g. cell phone) in a manner tailored to you as well as on any
   of your devices (e.g. tablet or PC).

   If you have given us pertinent consent, Google will connect your web
   and app browser progressions with your Google account for this purpose.
   As a result, it is possible to display the same personalized
   advertising messages on every device you log into with your Google
   account.

   To support this function, Google Analytics records Google authenticated
   IDs of users that are temporarily connected with our Google Analytics
   data to define and compile the target groups for the ads to be
   displayed on all devices.

   You have the option to permanently object to remarketing / targeting
   across all devices by deactivating personalized advertising in your
   Google account. To do this, please follow this
   link: https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/.

   The consolidation of the recorded data in your Google account shall
   occur exclusively based on your consent, which you may give to Google
   and also revoke there (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR). Data recording

8. Plug-ins and Tools

YouTube

   Our website uses plug-ins of the YouTube platform, which is operated by
   Google. The website operator is Google Ireland Limited (“Google”),
   Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.

   If you visit a page on our website into which a YouTube plug-in has
   been integrated, a connection with YouTube’s servers will be
   established. As a result, the YouTube server will be notified, which of
   our pages you have visited.

   Furthermore, YouTube will be able to place various cookies on your
   device. With the assistance of these cookies, YouTube will be able to
   obtain information about our website visitor. Among other things, this
   information will be used to generate video statistics with the aim of
   improving the user friendliness of the site and to prevent attempts to
   commit fraud. These cookies will stay on your device until you delete
   them.

   If you are logged into your YouTube account while you visit our site,
   you enable YouTube to directly allocate your browsing patterns to your
   personal profile. You have the option to prevent this by logging out of
   your YouTube account.

   The use of YouTube is based on our interest in presenting our online

Google Web Fonts

   To ensure that fonts used on this website are uniform, this website
   uses so-called Web Fonts provided by Google. When you access a page on
   our website, your browser will load the required web fonts into your
   browser cache to correctly display text and fonts.

   To do this, the browser you use will have to establish a connection
   with Google’s servers. As a result, Google will learn that your IP
   address was used to access our website. The use of Google Web Fonts is
   based on our interest in presenting our online content in a uniform and
   appealing way. According to Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR, this is a
   legitimate interest.

   If your browser should not support Web Fonts, a standard font installed
   on your computer will be used.

Retrieval of profile pictures from Gravatar

   In order to display the logged-in visitor on the
   internal typo3.orgarea, as well as for displaying the author picture in
   the news area and user listings the online service Gravatar by
   Automattic Inc.
   60 29th Street #343
   San Francisco, CA 94110
   United States of America, is used.

   Gravatar is a service where users can log in and store profile images
   and their email addresses. If users use the respective email address on
   other online services to comment or publish content their profile
   pictures can be displayed next to the posts or activities. For this
   purpose, the email address provided by the users is sent to Gravatar to
   check whether a profile is connected with it. This is the only purpose
   of transmitting the email address. Email addresses are not used for
   other purposes and deleted afterwards.

   The use of Gravatar is based on our legitimate interests in the sense
   of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR. With the help of Gravatar we offer the
   news authors as well as the users of the internal area the chance to
   personalize their contributions and their commitment to TYPO3 with a
   profile picture.

   In order to display the images Gravatar finds out the user’s IP address
   as this is necessary for the communication between the browser and the
   online service.Further information on the collection and use of the
   data by Gravatar can be found in the privacy policy of Automattic
   Inc.: https://automattic.com/privacy/.

   If users do not want a user image linked to their email address at
   Gravatar in the internal TYPO3 area or other frontend services, an
   email address not stored at Gravatar should be used to register. We
   also point out that it is possible to use an anonymous email address if
   users do not want their own email address transmitted to Gravatar.
   Users can completely prevent the transfer of data by not using our
   internal service area and don't post any news articles.

   you enter with PayPal.

Privacy Policy

1. An overview of data protection

General information

   The following information will provide you with an easy to navigate
   overview of what will happen with your personal data when you visit our
   website. The term “personal data” comprises all data that can be used
   to personally identify you. For detailed information about the subject
   matter of data protection, please consult our Data Protection
   Declaration, which we have included beneath this copy.

Data recording on our website

Who is the responsible party for the recording of data on this website (i.e.
the “controller”)?

   The data on this website is processed by the operator of the website,
   whose contact information is available under section “Information
   Required by Law” on this website.

How do we record your data?

   We collect your data as a result of your sharing of your data with us.
   This may, for instance be information you enter into our contact form.

   Our IT systems automatically record other data when you visit our
   website. This data comprises primarily technical information (e.g. web
   browser, operating system or time the site was accessed). This
   information is recorded automatically when you access our website.

What are the purposes we use your data for?

   A portion of the information is generated to guarantee the error free
   provision of the website. Other data may be used to analyse your user
   patterns.

What rights do you have as far as your information is concerned?

   You have the right to receive information about the source, recipients
   and purposes of your archived personal data at any time without having
   to pay a fee for such disclosures. You also have the right to demand
   that your data are rectified, blocked or eradicated. Please do not
   hesitate to contact us at any time under the address disclosed in
   section “Information Required by Law” on this website if you have
   questions about this or any other data protection related issues. You
   also have the right to log a complaint with the competent supervising
   agency.

   Moreover, under certain circumstances, you have the right to demand the
   restriction of the processing of your personal data. For details,
   please consult the Data Protection Declaration under section “Right to
   Restriction of Data Processing.”

Analysis tools and tools provided by third parties

   There is a possibility that your browsing patterns will be
   statistically analysed when your visit our website. Such analyses are
   performed primarily with cookies and with what we refer to as analysis
   programmes. As a rule, the analyses of your browsing patterns are
   conducted anonymously; i.e. the browsing patterns cannot be traced back
   to you. You have the option to object to such analyses or you can
   prevent their performance by not using certain tools. For detailed
   information about this, please consult our Data Protection Declaration
   below.

   You do have the option to object to such analyses. We will brief you on
   the objection options in this Data Protection Declaration.

2. General information and mandatory information

Data protection

   The operators of this website and its pages take the protection of your
   personal data very seriously. Hence, we handle your personal data as
   confidential information and in compliance with the statutory data
   protection regulations and this Data Protection Declaration.

   Whenever you use this website, a variety of personal information will
   be collected. Personal data comprises data that can be used to
   personally identify you. This Data Protection Declaration explains
   which data we collect as well as the purposes we use this data for. It
   also explains how, and for which purpose the information is collected.

   We herewith advise you that the transmission of data via the Internet
   (i.e. through e-mail communications) may be prone to security gaps. It
   is not possible to completely protect data against third party access.

Information about the responsible party (referred to as the “controller” in
the GDPR)

   The data processing controller on this website is:

   TYPO3 Association
   Herr Olivier Dobberkau / President
   Sihlbruggstrasse 105
   CH 6340 Baar

   Telephone: +41 41 511 00 35
   Email: info(at)typo3.org

   The controller is the natural person or legal entity that
   single-handedly or jointly with others makes decisions as to the
   purposes of and resources for the processing of personal data (e.g.
   names, e-mail addresses, etc.).

Revocation of your consent to the processing of data

   A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject
   to your express consent. You can also revoke at any time any consent
   you have already given us. To do so, all you are required to do is sent
   us an informal notification via e-mail. This shall be without prejudice
   to the lawfulness of any data collection that occurred prior to your
   revocation.

Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to object
to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)

   In the event that data are processed on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1
   lit. e or f GDPR, you have the right to at any time object to the
   processing of your personal data based on grounds arising from your
   unique situation. This also applies to any profiling based on these
   provisions. To determine the legal basis, on which any processing of
   data is based, please consult this Data Protection Declaration. If you
   log an objection, we will no longer process your affected personal
   data, unless we are in a position to present compelling protection
   worthy grounds for the processing of your data, that outweigh your
   interests, rights and freedoms or if the purpose of the processing is
   the claiming, exercising or defence of legal entitlements (objection
   pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 1 GDPR).

   If your personal data is being processed in order to engage in direct
   advertising, you have the right to at any time object to the processing
   of your affected personal data for the purposes of such advertising.
   This also applies to profiling to the extent that it is affiliated with
   such direct advertising. If you object, your personal data will
   subsequently no longer be used for direct advertising purposes
   (objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 2 GDPR).

Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency

   In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to
   log a complaint with a supervisory agency, in particular in the member
   state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at
   the place where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a
   complaint is in effect regardless of any other administrative or court
   proceedings available as legal recourses.

Right to data portability

   You have the right to demand that we hand over any data we
   automatically process on the basis of your consent or in order to
   fulfil a contract be handed over to you or a third party in a commonly
   used, machine readable format. If you should demand the direct transfer
   of the data to another controller, this will be done only if it is
   technically feasible.

SSL and/or TLS encryption

   For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential
   content, such as purchase orders or inquiries you submit to us as the
   website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption
   programme. You can recognise an encrypted connection by checking
   whether the address line of the browser switches from “http://” to
   “https://” and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser
   line.

   If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us
   cannot be read by third parties.

Encrypted payment transactions on this website

   If you are under an obligation to share your payment information (e.g.
   account number if you give us the authority to debit your bank account)
   with us after you have entered into a fee-based contract with us, this
   information is required to process payments.

   Payment transactions using common modes of paying (Visa/MasterCard,
   debit to your bank account) are processed exclusively via encrypted SSL
   or TLS connections. You can recognise an encrypted connection by
   checking whether the address line of the browser switches from
   “http://” to “https://” and also by the appearance of the lock icon in
   the browser line.

   If the communication with us is encrypted, third parties will not be
   able to read the payment information you share with us.

Information about, blockage, rectification and eradication of data

   Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the
   right to at any time demand information about your archived personal
   data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the
   processing of your data. You may also have a right to have your data
   rectified, blocked or eradicated. If you have questions about this
   subject matter or any other questions about personal data, please do
   not hesitate to contact us at any time at the address provided in
   section “Information Required by Law.”

Right to demand processing restrictions

   You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as
   the processing of your personal data is concerned. To do so, you may
   contact us at any time at the address provided in section “Information
   Required by Law.” The right to demand restriction of processing applies
   in the following cases:
     * In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data
       archived by us, we will usually need some time to verify this
       claim. During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have
       the right to demand that we restrict the processing of your
       personal data.
     * If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an
       unlawful manner, you have the option to demand the restriction of
       the processing of your data in lieu of demanding the eradication of
       this data.
     * If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to
       exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements, you have the right to
       demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data
       instead of its eradication.
     * If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 1 GDPR,
       your rights and our rights will have to be weighed against each
       other. As long as it has not been determined whose interests
       prevail, you have the right to demand a restriction of the
       processing of your personal data.

   If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data
   – with the exception of their archiving – may be processed only subject
   to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal entitlements or
   to protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for
   important public interest reasons cited by the European Union or a
   member state of the EU.

4. Recording of data on our website

Cookies

   In some instances, our website and its pages use so-called cookies.
   Cookies do not cause any damage to your computer and do not contain
   viruses. The purpose of cookies is to make our website more user
   friendly, effective and more secure. Cookies are small text files that
   are placed on your computer and stored by your browser.

   Most of the cookies we use are so-called “session cookies.” They are
   automatically deleted after your leave our site. Other cookies will
   remain archived on your device until you delete them. These cookies
   enable us to recognise your browser the next time you visit our

   Cookies that are required for the performance of the electronic
   communications transaction or to provide certain functions you want to

   6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest
   in storing cookies to ensure the technically error free and optimised
   provision of the operator’s services. If other cookies (e.g. cookies
   for the analysis of your browsing patterns) should be stored, they are
   addressed separately in this Data Protection Declaration.

Server log files

   The provider of this website and its pages automatically collects and

     * Referrer URL
     * The hostname of the accessing computer
     * The time of the server inquiry

   order to achieve this, server log files must be recorded.

Contact form

   If you submit inquiries to us via our contact form, the information
   provided in the contact form as well as any contact information
   provided therein will be stored by us in order to handle your inquiry
   and in the event that we have further questions. We will not share this
   information without your consent.

   Hence, the processing of the data entered into the contact form occurs
   exclusively based on your consent (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR). You
   have the right to revoke at any time any consent you have already given
   us. To do so, all you are required to do is sent us an informal
   notification via e-mail. This shall be without prejudice to the
   lawfulness of any data collection that occurred prior to your
   revocation.

   The information you have entered into the contact form shall remain
   with us until you ask us to eradicate the data, revoke your consent to
   the archiving of data or if the purpose for which the information is
   being archived no longer exists (e.g. after we have concluded our
   response to your inquiry). This shall be without prejudice to any
   mandatory legal provisions – in particular retention periods.

Registration on this website

   You have the option to register on our website to be able to use
   additional website functions. We shall use the data you enter only for
   the purpose of using the respective offer or service you have
   registered for. The required information we request at the time of
   registration must be entered in full. Otherwise we shall reject the
   registration.

   To notify you of any important changes to the scope of our portfolio or
   in the event of technical modifications, we shall use the e-mail
   address provided during the registration process.

   We shall process the data entered during the registration process on
   the basis of your consent (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR). You have the
   right to revoke at any time any consent you have already given us. To
   do so, all you are required to do is sent us an informal notification
   via e-mail. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any
   data collection that occurred prior to your revocation.

   The data recorded during the registration process shall be stored by us
   as long as you are registered on our website. Subsequently, such data
   shall be deleted. This shall be without prejudice to mandatory
   statutory retention obligations.

The comment function on this website

   When you use the comment function on this website, information on the
   time the comment was generated and, if you are not posting anonymously,
   the user name you have selected will be archived in addition to your
   comments.

Subscribing to comments

   As a user of this website, you have the option to subscribe to comments
   after you have registered. You will receive a confirmation e-mail, the
   purpose of which is to verify whether you are the actual holder of the
   provided e-mail address. You can deactivate this function at any time
   by following a respective link in the information e-mails. The data
   entered in conjunction with subscriptions to comments will be deleted
   in this case. However, if you have communicated this information to us
   for other purposes and from a different location (e.g. when subscribing
   to the newsletter), the data shall remain in our possession.

Storage period for comments

   Comments and any affiliated information (e.g. the IP address) shall be
   stored by us and remain on our website until the content the comment
   pertained to has been deleted in its entirety or if the comments had to
   be deleted for legal reasons (e.g. insulting comments).

Legal basis

   Comments are stored on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a
   GDPR). You have the right to revoke at any time any consent you have
   already given us. To do so, all you are required to do is sent us an
   informal notification via e-mail. This shall be without prejudice to
   the lawfulness of any data collection that occurred prior to your
   revocation.

Processing of data (customer and contract data)

   We collect, process and use personal data only to the extent necessary
   for the establishment, content organization or change of the legal
   relationship (data inventory). These actions are taken on the basis of
   Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. b GDPR, which permits the processing of data for
   the fulfilment of a contract or pre-contractual actions. We collect,
   process and use personal data concerning the use of our website (usage
   data) only to the extent that this is necessary to make it possible for
   users to utilize the services and to bill for them.

   The collected customer data shall be eradicated upon completion of the
   order or the termination of the business relationship. This shall be
   without prejudice to any statutory retention mandates.

Data transfer upon closing of contracts for services and digital content

   We share personal data with third parties only if this is necessary in
   conjunction with the handling of the contract; for instance, with the
   financial institution tasked with the processing of payments.

   Any further transfer of data shall not occur or shall only occur if you
   have expressly consented to the transfer. Any sharing of your data with
   third parties in the absence of your express consent, for instance for
   advertising purposes, shall not occur.

   The basis for the processing of data is Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. b GDPR,
   which permits the processing of data for the fulfilment of a contract
   or for pre-contractual actions.

5. Social media

Facebook plug-ins (Like & Share button)

   We have integrated plug-ins of the social network Facebook, provided by
   Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, California 94025, USA, on our
   website. You will be able to recognise Facebook plug-ins by the
   Facebook logo or the "Like" button on our website. An overview of the
   Facebook plug-ins is available under the following
   link: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/.

   Whenever you visit our website and its pages, the plug-in will
   establish a direct connection between your browser and the Facebook
   server. As a result, Facebook will receive the information that you
   have visited our website with your plug-in. However, if you click the
   Facebook “Like” button while you are logged into your Facebook account,
   you can link the content of our website and its pages with your
   Facebook profile. As a result, Facebook will be able to allocate the
   visit to our website and its pages to your Facebook user account. We
   have to point out, that we as the provider of the website do not have
   any knowledge of the transferred data and its use by Facebook. For more
   detailed information, please consult the Data Privacy Declaration of
   Facebook at: https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation.

   If you do not want Facebook to be able to allocate your visit to our
   website and its pages to your Facebook user account, please log out of
   your Facebook account while you are on our website.

   The use of the Facebook plug-in is based on Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR.
   The operator of the website has a legitimate interest in being as
   visible as possible on social media.

Twitter plug-in

   We have integrated functions of the social media platform Twitter into
   our website. These functions are provided by Twitter Inc., 1355 Market
   Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA. While you use Twitter
   and the "Re-Tweet" function, websites you visit are linked to your
   Twitter account and disclosed to other users. During this process, data
   are transferred to Twitter as well. We must point out, that we, the
   providers of the website and its pages do not know anything about the
   content of the data transferred and the use of this information by
   Twitter. For more details, please consult Twitter’s Data Privacy
   Declaration at: https://twitter.com/en/privacy.

   The use of Twitter plug-ins is based on Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR. The
   operator of the website has a legitimate interest in being as visible
   as possible on social media.

   You have the option to reset your data protection settings on Twitter
   under the account settings at https://twitter.com/account/settings.

Google+ plug-in

   Our website and its pages use functions of Google+; the provider is
   Google Ireland Limited (“Google”), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin
   4, Ireland.

   Recording and sharing of information: With the assistance of the
   Google+ button, you can publish information worldwide. The Google+
   button provides you and other users with custom tailored Google content
   as well as content of our partners. Google saves the information you
   have entered for content with +1 as well as information about the
   website/page you viewed when you clicked on +1. Your +1 entries may
   appear as information along with your profile name and your photo on
   Google services, such as in search results or in your Google profile or
   in other locations on websites and ads on the Internet.

   Google records information about your +1 activities to improve Google’s
   services for you and others. To be able to use the Google+ button, you
   will need a public Google profile, which is visible around the world,
   which must contain at least the name you have chosen for your profile.
   This name is used in conjunction with all Google services. In some
   cases, this name may also replace another name you have used when
   sharing content via your Google account. The identity of your Google
   profile may be displayed to users who know your e-mail address or are
   in possession of other information related to you that identifies you.

   Use of the recorded information: Besides the abovementioned purposes of
   use, the information you provide is also used in compliance with the
   applicable Google Data Privacy Policies. Google may potentially publish
   summary statistics about the +1 activities of its users or shares this
   information with users and partners, such as publishers, prospective
   customers or affiliated websites.

   The use of the Google+ plug-in is based on Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR.
   The operator of the website has a legitimate interest in being as
   visible as possible on social media.

6. Analysis tools and advertising

Matomo (formerly called Piwik)

   This website uses the open source web analysis service Matomo. Matomo
   uses so-called “cookies,” which are text files that are stored on your
   computer and that make it possible to analyse your use of this website.
   In conjunction with this, the information about the use of this website
   generated by the cookie will be archived on our server. Prior to
   archiving, the IP address will first be anonymized.

   Matomo cookies will remain on your device until you delete them.

   The storage of Matomo cookies and the use of this analysis tool are
   based on Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a
   legitimate interest in the analysis of user patterns, in order to
   optimize the operator’s web offerings and advertising.

   The information generated by cookies concerning the use of this website
   shall not be shared with any third parties. You may prevent the storage
   of cookies at any time by making pertinent changes to your browser
   software settings; however, we have to point out that in this case you
   may not be able to use all of the functions of this website to their
   fullest extent.

   If you do not consent to the storage and use of your data, you have the
   option to deactivate the storage and use of such data here. In this
   case, an opt out cookie will be placed in our browser, which prevent
   the storage of usage data by Matomo. If you delete your cookies, this
   will also result in the deletion of the Matomo opt out cookie. Hence,
   you will have to reactivate the opt out when you return to visit our
   website.

   Our websites use the functions of Google Analytics Remarketing in
   combination with the functions of Google AdWords and Google
   DoubleClick, which work on all devices. The provider of these solutions
   is Google Ireland Limited (“Google”), Gordon House, Barrow Street,
   Dublin 4, Ireland.

   This function makes it possible to connect the advertising target
   groups generated with Google Analytics Remarketing with the functions
   of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick, which work on all devices.
   This makes it possible to display interest-based customized advertising
   messages, depending on your prior usage and browsing patterns on a
   device (e.g. cell phone) in a manner tailored to you as well as on any
   of your devices (e.g. tablet or PC).

   If you have given us pertinent consent, Google will connect your web
   and app browser progressions with your Google account for this purpose.
   As a result, it is possible to display the same personalized
   advertising messages on every device you log into with your Google
   account.

   To support this function, Google Analytics records Google authenticated
   IDs of users that are temporarily connected with our Google Analytics
   data to define and compile the target groups for the ads to be
   displayed on all devices.

   You have the option to permanently object to remarketing / targeting
   across all devices by deactivating personalized advertising in your
   Google account. To do this, please follow this
   link: https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/.

   The consolidation of the recorded data in your Google account shall
   occur exclusively based on your consent, which you may give to Google
   and also revoke there (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR). Data recording
   processes that are not consolidated in your Google account (for
   instance because you do not have a Google account or have objected to
   the consolidation of data), the recording of data is based on Art. 6
   Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR. The legitimate interest arises from the fact that
   the operator of the website has a legitimate interest in the anonymized
   analysis of website visitor for advertising purposes.

   For further information and the pertinent data protection regulations,
   please consult the Data Privacy Policies of Google
   at: https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl=en.

8. Plug-ins and Tools

YouTube

   Our website uses plug-ins of the YouTube platform, which is operated by
   Google. The website operator is Google Ireland Limited (“Google”),
   Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.

   If you visit a page on our website into which a YouTube plug-in has
   been integrated, a connection with YouTube’s servers will be
   established. As a result, the YouTube server will be notified, which of
   our pages you have visited.

   Furthermore, YouTube will be able to place various cookies on your
   device. With the assistance of these cookies, YouTube will be able to
   obtain information about our website visitor. Among other things, this
   information will be used to generate video statistics with the aim of
   improving the user friendliness of the site and to prevent attempts to
   commit fraud. These cookies will stay on your device until you delete
   them.

   If you are logged into your YouTube account while you visit our site,
   you enable YouTube to directly allocate your browsing patterns to your
   personal profile. You have the option to prevent this by logging out of
   your YouTube account.

   The use of YouTube is based on our interest in presenting our online
   content in an appealing manner. Pursuant to Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR,
   this is a legitimate interest.

   For more information on how YouTube handles user data, please consult
   the YouTube Data Privacy Policy

Google Web Fonts

   To ensure that fonts used on this website are uniform, this website
   uses so-called Web Fonts provided by Google. When you access a page on
   our website, your browser will load the required web fonts into your
   browser cache to correctly display text and fonts.

   To do this, the browser you use will have to establish a connection
   with Google’s servers. As a result, Google will learn that your IP
   address was used to access our website. The use of Google Web Fonts is
   based on our interest in presenting our online content in a uniform and
   appealing way. According to Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR, this is a
   legitimate interest.

   If your browser should not support Web Fonts, a standard font installed
   on your computer will be used.

   For more information on Google Web Fonts, please follow this
   link: https://developers.google.com/fonts/faqand consult Google’s Data
   Privacy Declaration under: https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en.

Retrieval of profile pictures from Gravatar

   In order to display the logged-in visitor on the
   internal typo3.orgarea, as well as for displaying the author picture in
   the news area and user listings the online service Gravatar by
   Automattic Inc.
   60 29th Street #343
   San Francisco, CA 94110
   United States of America, is used.

   Gravatar is a service where users can log in and store profile images
   and their email addresses. If users use the respective email address on
   other online services to comment or publish content their profile
   pictures can be displayed next to the posts or activities. For this
   purpose, the email address provided by the users is sent to Gravatar to
   check whether a profile is connected with it. This is the only purpose
   of transmitting the email address. Email addresses are not used for
   other purposes and deleted afterwards.

   The use of Gravatar is based on our legitimate interests in the sense
   of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR. With the help of Gravatar we offer the
   news authors as well as the users of the internal area the chance to
   personalize their contributions and their commitment to TYPO3 with a
   profile picture.

   In order to display the images Gravatar finds out the user’s IP address
   as this is necessary for the communication between the browser and the
   online service.Further information on the collection and use of the
   data by Gravatar can be found in the privacy policy of Automattic
   Inc.: https://automattic.com/privacy/.

   If users do not want a user image linked to their email address at
   Gravatar in the internal TYPO3 area or other frontend services, an
   email address not stored at Gravatar should be used to register. We
   also point out that it is possible to use an anonymous email address if
   users do not want their own email address transmitted to Gravatar.
   Users can completely prevent the transfer of data by not using our
   internal service area and don't post any news articles.

   you enter with PayPal.
