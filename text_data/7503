   In spring 1967, in Palo Alto, California, history teacher Ron Jones
   conducted an experiment with his class of 15-year-olds to sample the
   experience of the attraction and rise of the Nazis in Germany before
   World War II.  In a matter of days the experiment began to get out of
   control, as those attracted to the movement became aggressive zealots
   and the rigid rules invited confusion and chaos.  This story has
   attracted considerable attention over the years through films, books,
   plays and musicals, and verges on urban legend.  It serves as a
   teaching tool, to facilitate discussion of those uncomfortable topics
   of history, human nature, psychology, group behavior, intolerance and
   hate.

   The primary purpose of this website is to document and separate fact
   from fiction about the original experiment.  As the story is told and
   re-told, reported and fictionalized, carried in the news and blogged on
   the internet, it is becoming more difficult to learn what really
   happened.  There has also been more information available recently from
   the original students, and that has been very helpful in sorting things
   out.  This is intended to be a comprehensive and current collection of
   material and news, mostly from original sources.

   It is also the purpose here to provide additional material for the
   discussion of this dark and never-ending side of human nature.  In
   today's confused and chaotic world, it seems that polarization,
   persecution, political and religious extremism, cults, gangs and
   bullying are as prevalent as ever.  The risks and stakes have never
   been higher, and this lesson is needed now more than ever.

   This website is managed and overseen by original participants in The
   Third Wave experiment, and will contain the latest news of our
   activities, along with the most complete and accurate information about
   our experience.  We hope you find it helpful in your research and
   studies.

History of the Wave Story

   The original experiment was named "The Third Wave" and occurred at
   Cubberley Senior High School in Palo Alto, California, in March/April
   1967.  Teacher Ron Jones wrote a short story about the experience that
   was published in spring 1976.  This was followed by a TV movie ("The
   Wave") by famed producer Norman Lear on October 4, 1981.  The
   subsequent 1981 book "The Wave" is a novelization of the Lear movie,
   and was written by Todd Strasser (aka Morton Rhue).  This book is
   widely read by students in schools throughout the world.  In spring
   2008, German director Dennis Gansel's popular film "Die Welle" set the
   story in a high school in present-day Germany.  There have also been
   various Wave plays and musicals performed over the years, and a new
   musical by original teacher Ron Jones debuted in March 2010, as well as
   his new play "The Third Wave" in 2011.  On October 10, 2010, Emmy
   nominee and original Third Wave class member Philip Neel's new
   documentary of the original experiment, entitled "Lesson Plan",
   premiered at the Mill Valley Film Festival.  New accounts are emerging
   from original Third Wave students.  There are also periodic rumors that
   Hollywood will produce a new Wave film for theaters, especially given
   the recent success of the German film.  This is all outlined in more
   detail on the Stories page, and further examined in the FAQ pages.
   There is also a chronology page of early articles.

Lessons from The Wave

   The Wave story is a simple one, but an excellent means to facilitate
   discussion about very sensitive and difficult subjects:  the rise of
   the Nazis and other totalitarian societies and the atrocities they
   perpetrate, the psychology of leaders and followers, when passion for
   one's cause leads to intolerance and persecution of others, extremist
   political and religious groups, cults, gangs, bullying, etc.  Quotes,
   traits, terminology, and other information are explored on the Lessons
   page.

Online Wave Museum

   While very little remains from the original Third Wave experiment, more
   material is surfacing as former students have been located.  Photos of
   the classroom, articles in the school newspaper, a report card from the
   class, party membership cards, Third Wave posters, some class notes and
   handouts, etc. have been discovered.  There are also interesting
   materials from the subsequent films, books, plays and musicals.  These
   are shown or linked via the Museum page.
