Researchers Hacked Amazon’s Alexa to Spy On Users, Again

   Researchers discovered a flaw in Amazon’s Alexa virtual assistant that
   enabled them to eavesdrop on consumers with smart devices – and
   automatically transcribe every word said.

   A malicious proof-of-concept Amazon Echo Skill shows how attackers can
   abuse the Alexa virtual assistant to eavesdrop on consumers with smart
   devices – and automatically transcribe every word said.

   Checkmarx researchers told Threatpost that they created a
   proof-of-concept Alexa Skill that abuses the virtual assistant’s
   built-in request capabilities. The rogue Skill begins with the
   initiation of an Alexa voice-command session that fails to terminate
   (stop listening) after the command is given. Next, any recorded audio
   is transcribed (if voices are captured) and a text transcript is sent
   to a hacker. Checkmarx said it brought its proof-of-concept attack to
   Amazon’s attention and that the company fixed a coding flaw that
   allowed the rogue Skill to capture prolonged audio on April 10.

   “On default, Alexa ends the sessions after each duration… we were able
   to build in a feature that kept the session going [so Alexa would
   continue listening]. We also wanted to make sure that the user is not
   prompted and that Alexa is still listening without re-prompts,” Erez
   Yalon, manager of Application Security Research at Checkmarx, told
   Threatpost.

   Checkmarx researchers said they were able to manipulate code within a
   built-in Alexa JavaScript library (ShouldEndSession) to pull off the
   hack. The JavaScript library is tied to Alexa’s orders to stop
   listening if it doesn’t hear the user’s command properly. Checkmarx’s
   tweak to the code simply enabled Alexa to continue listening, no matter
   the voice request order.

   One challenge for researchers was the issue of the “reprompt” feature
   in Alexa. Reprompts are used by Alexa if the service keeps the session
   open after sending the response but the user does not say anything, so
   Alexa will ask the user to repeat the order. However, Checkmarx
   researchers were able to replace the reprompt feature with empty
   reprompts, so that a listening cycle starts without letting the user
   know.

   Finally, researchers accurately transcribed the voice received by
   skills: “In order to be able to listen and transcribe any arbitrary
   text, we had to do two tricks. First, we added a new slot-type, which
   captures any singleword, not limited to a closed list of words. Second,
   in order to capture sentences at almost any length, we had to build a
   formatted string for each possible length,” according to the report.

   One big issue Checkmarx faced is that on Echo devices a shining blue
   ring reveals when Alexa listens. But, “the whole point of Alexa is that
   unlike a smartphone or tablet, you do not have to look at it to operate
   it,” said Yalon. “They are made to be placed in a corner where users
   simply speak to it without actively looking to its direction. And with
   Alexa voice services, vendor are embedding Alexa capabilities into
   their products and those products might not provide visual indication
   when the session is running.”

   Amazon resolved this issue through tweaking several features on April
   10, said Checkmarx. Researchers said Amazon fixed the problem by
   applying specific criteria to identify and reject eavesdropping skills
   during certification, detecting empty re-prompts and detecting
   longer-than-usual sessions.

   According to Checkmarx researcher Yalon, every “skill” needs to go
   through a certification process and be approved by Amazon before it can
   be published to the Amazon store.

   “Checkmarx did not try to publicly release the malicious skill… If we
   did, Amazon would need to approve it. We do not know the timeline of
   Amazon’s certification process, but we have no reason to believe
   (including after discussions with Amazon) that our malicious skill
   would not have been approved prior to the recent mitigations,” said
   Yalon.

   “Customer trust is important to us and we take security and privacy
   seriously. We have put mitigations in place for detecting this type of
   skill behavior and reject or suppress those skills when we do,” an
   Amazon spokesperson told Threatpost.

   The proof of concept raises questions about the privacy risks around
   voice services such as Alexa, as well as other connected devices in the
   home.

   In September, researchers devised a proof of concept that gives
   potentially harmful instructions to popular voice assistants like Siri,
   Google, Cortana, and Alexa using ultrasonic frequencies instead of
   voice commands. And in November, security firm Armis disclosed that
   Amazon Echo and Google Home devices are vulnerable to attacks through
   the over-the-air BlueBorne Bluetooth vulnerability.

   USA (“Threatpost”, “Threatpost.com”, “Threatpost Inc.”, “TP”, or “we”)

   If you have any questions regarding the processing of your personal
   information, please contact Threatpost at privacy@threatpost.com.

Your personal data – what is it?

   Personal data relates to a living individual who can be identified from
   that data.  Identification can be by the information alone or in
   conjunction with any other information in the data controller’s
   possession or likely to come into such possession. The processing of
   personal data is governed by [the General Data Protection Regulation
   2016/679 (the “GDPR”)

Why we process your personal data

   We use your personal data for the following purposes:
     * Marketing and service information.
     * Payments
     * Servicing our contractual obligations to you as set out in our
       contract with you.

The categories of personal data

   We process the following categories of your data:
     * Name
     * Email address
     * Static IP address

   We have obtained your personal data from you directly.

   In order to post comments and help moderate comments on this Web site,
   you must first create an account with a username and password. That
   information is used to provide you with access to your profile and
   comments. The registration system also requires that you provide a
   valid email address to confirm your account. Separately, when you email
   Threatpost.com, we retain your address and correspondence, which may be
   used to raise and respond to issues and inquiries of all types.

   If you send us an email, we may collect your name, your email address,
   and any other information which you choose to give us. Any information
   that you provide is used by Threatpost Inc. solely for the purposes for
   which it is provided. If we do collect any personal data, it will be
   processed and stored securely, for no longer than is necessary in light
   of the reasons for which it was first collected. We will comply with
   our obligations and safeguard your rights under the GDPR at all times.

What is our legal basis for processing your personal data

   Our lawful basis for processing your general personal data:
     * Consent of the data subject.
     * Processing necessary for the performance of a contract with the
       data subject or to take steps to enter into a contract.
     * Processing necessary for compliance with a legal obligation.

Sharing your personal data

   We may disclose your personal data as follows:

Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)

   We share aggregated demographic information about our reader base with
   our third-party advertising partners including browser information and
   traffic statistics. We do not link this data to individual readers’
   accounts or personally identifiable information.

Personally identifiable information

   We will not collect any personal information about you on this website
   without your consent. Any personal information which you volunteer to
   us will be treated with the highest standards of data security and
   confidentiality, strictly in accordance with GDPR.

   We do not share personally identifiable information with third parties,
   with one limited exception: we may disclose personally identifiable
   information about you if we have a good faith belief that doing so is
   required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other judicial or
   administrative order.

Cookies

   A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for
   record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. The information
   we store in cookies is, in some cases, linked to readers’ accounts. No
   special attempt to harvest cookie data is being made on this site, and
   no attempt is ever made to correlate visitor data with real people or
   identities.

   We use both short-term cookies and persistent cookies. A short-term
   cookie expires within a limited period of time. We use session cookies
   so that readers with accounts can navigate and contribute to our site
   without logging in multiple times over a short period of time. A
   persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of
   time. We use persistent cookies to recognize account holders and
   present the site accordingly.

   You can remove cookies by following directions provided in your
   Internet browser’s “help” file. If you reject cookies, you may still
   use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as
   comments, will require logging in for each action you want to take.

Third-party Advertisers

   Third Party Advertisers may place or recognize unique cookies on your
   browser and use information about your visits to this and other Web
   sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites
   about goods and services. The information collected does not include
   personally identifiable information like your name, address, email
   address or telephone number. It does include IP addresses, though these
   are not tied to individual readers’ accounts. No attempt is ever made
   to link source IP addresses to any information that is personally
   identifiable.

Links to Other Sites

   This Website contains links to other sites that are not owned or
   controlled by Threatpost Inc. Please be aware that we are not
   responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites. This
   privacy statement applies only to information collected by
   Threatpost.com.

Transfer of data abroad

   The personal data provided by users to Threatpost can be processed in
   the following countries, including countries outside European Union
   (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA) which have not been deemed to
   have an adequate level of data protection by the European Commission:
   EEA: Germany, Netherlands, France, United Kingdom; non-EEA:
   Switzerland, Canada, Singapore, Russia, Japan, USA, Mexico, China,
   Azerbaijan. According to our general business practice, the data
   received from users in the EU are processed on servers located in the
   USA.

   Threatpost Inc. has taken appropriate security measures to protect your
   personal data in accordance with security and privacy best practices,
   including, utilizing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual
   Clauses for transfers of personal information between its group
   companies, which requires all group companies to protect personal
   information being processed from the EEA to an equivalent standard to
   that required under EU data protection law. Where we share your
   personal data with a third party service provider outside of the
   European Economic Area and Switzerland (as detailed in the section
   entitled “Sharing your information”), we contractually oblige the third
   party service provider to implement adequate safeguards to protect your
   information.

How long do we keep your personal data?

   We keep your personal data for no longer than reasonably necessary for
   a period of 6 years in order to meet legal requirements.  Examples
   include in case of any legal claims/complaints and for safeguarding
   purposes.

Automated decision making

   We do not use automated decision making.

Your rights and your personal data

   Also we inform you that you have certain rights regarding the personal
   data we maintain about you:
     * Right to be informed. You have the right to be provided with clear,
       transparent and easily understandable information about how we use
       your personal data, and your rights.
     * Right of access. You have the right to request information about
       how we use your personal data. In addition, you can request to
       receive a copy of the Personal Data we process about you and to
       check that we are lawfully processing it.
     * Right to rectification. Request correction of the personal data
       that we process about you.
     * Right to erasure (Right to be forgotten). This enables you to ask
       us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason,
       such as statutory retention periods, for us continuing to process
       it.
     * Right of restriction of processing. This enables you to ask us to
       suspend the processing of personal data about you, for example if
       you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing
       it
     * Right to data portability. You may request the transfer of your
       personal data. We will provide to you, or a third party you have
       chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used,
       machine-readable format.
     * Right to object. You may object at any time to our processing of
       your personal data when such processing is based on our legitimate
       interests.
     * Right to withdraw data protection consent. If you withdraw your
       consent, we may not be able to provide you with access to the
       certain specific functionalities of our Site. We will advise you if
       this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
     * Right to complain. You have the right to contact the data
       protection authority of your country in order to lodge a complaint
       against our data protection and privacy practices

How to exercise your rights

   If you wish to exercise these rights, you may at any time directly at
   privacy@threatpost.com.

   Typically, you will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data
   (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, except in relation
   to consent withdrawal, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request
   is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive, or, we may refuse to
   comply with your request in these circumstances.

   We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm
   your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to
   exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to
   ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no
   right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further
   information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

   We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
   Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is
   particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this
   case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

Complaints

   If you would like to make a complaint regarding this Privacy Statement
   or our practices in relation to your personal data, please contact us
   at privacy@threatpost.com.

   If you consider that the processing of personal data relating to you
   infringes applicable data protection law, you have the right to lodge a
   complaint with the competent supervisory authority at any time. Which
   supervisory authority has competence for your complaint can depend on
   the country where you reside.
