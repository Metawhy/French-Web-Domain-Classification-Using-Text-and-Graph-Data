YAM 2018 Art

   Well, I have certainly gotten behind on blogging! Taking pictures of my
   students' art has not been at the top of my to do list for the past few
   months.
   I just picked up my students' artwork last night from the Youth Art
   Month exhibit at the Indiana Statehouse. I was able to enter 5 pieces,
   and I was excited that my 3rd grade student won an honorable mention
   award! Since this is a large, state-wide art show, any award is a huge
   accomplishment. I am proud of my student's work!
   Here are the 5 pieces I submitted:

December Famous Artist of the Month: M. C. Escher

   I am excited for my students to be learning about M. C. Escher this
   month. He was an artist with a vivid imagination and amazing technical
   precision. It is interesting that he failed math in the school, as his
   artwork, especially his tessellations, are very mathematical in nature.
   [image1%2B%25287%2529.JPG]
   This text below M. C. Escher's photograph on the bulletin board reads:

                                 M.C. Escher

   Born: June 17, 1898
   Died: March 27, 1972
   Nationality: Netherlands
   Art style: Tessellations; Op Art; Surreallism
   Maurits Cornelis Escher was the youngest of 5 boys. He was raised by
   his father and his step mother. M.C. Escher’s father was a civil
   engineer, and engineering influenced his art.
   M.C. Escher was a sickly child, and was drawn to music and creative
   endeavors. He was not good at math, and technically never graduated
   from high school, since he could not pass the final math exams.
   After high school, M.C. Escher studied at the School for Architecture
   and Decorative Arts in Haarlem, Netherlands. He became interested in
   graphic design and woodblock printmaking.
   Despite failing math in school, M.C. Escher’s art is characterized by
   mathematical precision, especially in his tessellations (designs where
   shapes interlock like puzzle pieces).

About Me

   My photo

   Jessica Young
          I teach art at Carroll Elementary School in Flora, IN. My
          favorite art medium to work in is ceramics, but I also enjoy
          painting, drawing, and printmaking. While I enjoy creating art
          on my own, it is even more rewarding to share my love for art
          with my wonderful students. Their eagerness, willingness to
          learn, and talent make teaching a joy. I am a member of the
          Reformed Presbyterian Church of Lafayette. I have many close
          friends at church who support me and encourage me as I try to
          live for Christ.
