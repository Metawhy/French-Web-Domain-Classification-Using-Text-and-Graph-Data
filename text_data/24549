In 1945 Dynamo Moscow Sparked Chaos At Chelsea And Cheated Arsenal

   In 1945, Britain, as well as the rest of the world, was recovering from
   six years of war. You’d think that the last thing the country’s weary
   population would have on its mind would be football. You’d think wrong.

   Starved of proper football for six years, and with admiration and
   gratitude for the Soviet war effort still strong, the news that the
   famous Dynamo Moscow – or Moscow Dynamo, as they were known then –
   would be playing a series of friendlies in Britain in 1945 sparked huge
   excitement.

   Of course, the British press were sniffy. The Sunday Express reported:

     “They are not nearly good enough to play our class of professional
     teams. Their players are simply a set of very earnest amateurs… I
     say this confidently. In three hours’ football….they look an
     ordinary lot. Now it may be argued that they are reserving their
     real form for the Chelsea match. I won’t have that. No set of
     players is clever enough to hide its form over three hours/ There
     must be a flash of form, but none arrived from the Russians. They
     have a fairly good idea of passing, but nearly all their work is
     done standing still. And I they are so slow that you can almost hear
     them think.”

   A Russian radio commentator accompanying the team and lamented the
   austere British welcome:

     “In England, the fatherland of football, we were met according to
     the English fashion: rather dryly without flags, music or flowers.
     Officials of the British federation coldly shook our hands and then
     threw us to the journalists to be torn to pieces. But we also have
     our customs. We don not like to talk in vain, so we decided to keep
     quiet for the time-being. The players were taken to the Guards
     Barracks to be housed, but we discovered mould on the walls, cobwebs
     and hard bolsters instead of pillows. We did not like this, and we
     went to the Soviet Embassy, where we stayed the night.”

   But the public went crazy for the exotic visitors.

   Before the first game of the tour, fans started queuing at Stamford
   Bridge at 8am for a 2.30pm kick-off.

   The trickle soon turned to a flood. Local residents hired out their
   gardens for bicycle storage at thruppence a bike, and charged two
   shillings and sixpence to help drivers find a parking space.

   The District Line and local bus services were overwhelmed. The gates
   opened at 1pm but still the crowds came. At 2.10pm the gates were
   closed, leaving some 20,000 fans – many with tickets – outside. So they
   sought other means of entry.

   Some fans scaled buildings on the Fulham Road that had windows and
   roofs high enough to offer a view of the ground. Residents answering a
   knock on their front door were pushed aside by fans who took to the
   upper floors or stormed through gardens to get a view of the pitch.

   DYNAMOS FIRST VISIT TO GREAT BRITAIN AND AN ESTIMATED 100,000 PEOPLE
   TURNED UP TO WATCH THE MATCH. THE SHEER WEIGHT OF THE CROWD BROKE DOWN
   ALL THE GATES OF THE GROUND. THE GAME ENDED IN A 3-3 DRAW. Mandatory

   Fences were torn down to be used as battering rams against locked
   gates. Fans scaled walls and fences, crossed electric rail tracks,
   scrambled up embankments and took to underground tunnels.

   There were 75,000 inside the ground when the gates were closed, and
   it’s estimated that another 15,000 forced their way in.

   Some fans fell through the glass roof of the main stand. The crush
   pushed the crowd over the perimeter of the greyhound track and up to
   the very edge of the pitch. The press described the scenes as “The
   Battle of Fulham Road”.

   The game turned out to be a belter, finishing in a 3-3 draw. At the
   whistle, the crowd poured onto the pitch and carried the Soviet players
   aloft.

   Russian commentator Vadim Sinyavsky shouted down his microphone:
   “Listen comrades in Moscow, Leningrad, Tbilisi, Berlin, we have passed
   our first exam with honour.”

   Dynamo went on to play Cardiff City (winning 10-1) and Arsenal, the
   dominant England side between the wars. Dynamo coach Mikhail Yakushin
   opined: “To come to London and not play Arsenal would be like visiting
   Cairo without seeing the pyramids.”

   Arsenal’s Highbury ground had been an air-raid control centre, meaning
   the match was played Tottenham’s White Hart Lane.

   4-4-2 recalls the crazy match:

     …a pea-souper fog descended upon north London and seemed certain to
     end the tie. But incredibly, the Russian referee, M. Nikolay
     Latyshev, ushered the players out to play. More than 54,000
     spectators had filled the ground, but catching any of the action at
     the opposite end of the field was impossible. The game was only 30
     seconds old when Dynamo managed to poke an early lead. Like many, LV
     Manning , in the press box, missed the goal. He could only describe
     the crowd: “A thousand men lighted a thousand cigarettes and it
     looked like a thousand bonfires.” Arsenal’s own fire was soon
     stirred and Mortensen and Matthews quickly helped the Gunners
     establish a 3-1 lead, but a goal by Beskov made it 3-2 at half-time.
     To those in the crowd and on the pitch it seemed inevitable that the
     game would be abandoned. But it wasn’t, and vague shadows appeared
     to contest a farcical second half. Serge Soloviev restored parity
     early on despite being blatantly offside, even in the fog. Somewhat
     bizarrely, the Russian official had placed both of his English
     linesman on one side of the pitch and himself on the other. His
     decisions were perplexing the hosts and it wasn’t long before Dynamo
     scored a winning goal through an again-offside Bobrov. Having had
     what appeared to be a perfectly valid goal ruled out, Allison
     suggested to the Soviet Embassy’s First Secretary that they concede
     the game to stop the nonsense. His offer was politely declined. The
     final straw came when several Arsenal players noticed that the
     Russians seemed to have an extra player on the field and it was
     established that due to a mix-up in the fog during a substitution.
     Dynamo had been playing with 12 men for a good 20 minutes. With the
     numbers evened up, the visitors held on their lead to record a 4-3
     victory.

     Post match, Arsenal captain Cliff Bastin claimed that, “so long as
     the Dynamos got the ball in the net, even if they carried it there,
     the referee was going to award them a goal.”

   The final match saw Moscow take on Glasgow Rangers before a
   huge 92,000 crowd. The game ended in a 2-2 draw.
