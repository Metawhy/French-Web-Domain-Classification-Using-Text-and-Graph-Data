A conversation on density

The Five Thousand Pound Life: Land, Density (Part 4)

   September 26, 2014

   IFRAME: https://player.vimeo.com/video/110786946?dnt=1&app_id=122963

   In the final part of the Density session, Talen, Pope, and Waldheim
   join Vishaan Chakrabarti, a principal at SHoP Architects and author
   of A Country of Cities, to debate the varied forms that density does or
   should take. Waldheim refers to a significant shift in the perception
   of closely shared living space, with dense environments now considered
   a status symbol, which Talen builds on by noting that this increasing
   demand for density exacerbates social segregation and separation. Pope
   suggests that the suburbs can break free from their horizontal form and
   build vertically, creating walkable environments. The panel debates the
   designer’s role and responsibility in class separation and
   gentrification, as well as imperatives to look at morphologies beyond
   the grid when considering urban form.

   The Five Thousand Pound Life: Land was a symposium on rethinking land
   and its value in light of climate change organized by The Architectural
   League and co-sponsored by The Cooper Union Institute for Sustainable
   Design in September 2014.

   Participants in the Density panel drew on their backgrounds in
   architecture, landscape architecture, geography, city planning, and
   urban theory to discuss the value of density and the forms that it
   takes — or should take — to mitigate ecological impact.

Connection and its costs: Ground transportation and climate change

   The urgency of radical action to mitigate the causes of climate change
   is more apparent every week. In early October 2018, the UN
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a report describing
   the transformative, systemic changes necessary to hold global warming
   to 1.5 degrees C, with a window for action of little more than a
   decade. An even more recent study published in Nature found that the
   oceans have absorbed much more heat from our warming planet than was
   previously understood, which means that the impact of burning fossil
   fuels is even higher than earlier projected. We are moving much more
   quickly toward perilously high increases in global temperature than we
   thought, with a much shorter timeframe to diminish and reverse our
   impact.

   How do the ways that we move ourselves and the goods we manufacture and
   consume perform when measured in terms of greenhouse gas production?
   How do we imagine, and evaluate, transportation futures through this
   lens? Transportation: Connection and Its Costs, a part of the
   League’s Five Thousand Pound Life initiative, is a three-part series of
   programs that looks at air, sea, and ground transportation in the age
   of climate change. Presentations and discussions from the programs on
   air and sea transportation, presented in June 2018, are available here.

   The November 3, 2018 conference looked at land-based transportation of
   both people and goods. (Videos documenting the day can be found below.)
   The US EPA says that the transportation sector produced 28% of US
   greenhouse gas emissions in 2016 (tied as the largest sectoral
   producer, along with the production of electricity, also at 28%), and
   within the transport sector, land-based modes produced 85% of
   greenhouse gases. The accelerating pace of technological innovation in
   this arena, along with increasing capital investment and cultural
   evolution towards the adoption of new modes of movement and new demands
   for speed and ease in the movement of goods, have all coalesced into a
   moment of intense activity and discussion. Ride-hail companies have
   significantly changed the mix and number of vehicles on city streets
   around the country and around the world; the quality of service of
   public transportation, at least in New York, is in a sorry state;
   ambitious start-ups offer new products and services at a dizzying rate;
   autonomous vehicles are the focus of high-stakes competition among the
   big technology and car companies. Cultural critics, public
   policymakers, and designers are rushing to keep up.

   Are we asking the right questions as this wave of activity and
   invention sweeps us forward? What are the energy use and emissions
   implications of all of these new technologies, and the desires and
   demand they create? Does the move to electric-powered vehicles offer
   the benefits we think it does? Even with the intensity of interest in
   transportation futures, are we moving fast enough, and in the right
   direction, to do what needs to be done? Who gains and who loses in this
   transportation transition? Can public policy shape this explosion of
   activity for our collective benefit? How can architects and planners
   contribute to a productive future?

   The November 3 conference brought together scholars, policymakers, and
   designers to help understand the relationships between mobility, energy
   use, and climate change. The League’s hope is that cross-disciplinary
   conversation about the assumptions embedded in our thinking, the
   potential unintended consequences of our actions, the choices we face,
   and the possibilities we can imagine can help set us on the path to a
   much less carbon intensive and more viable future.

   The event was organized by The Architectural League and held at the
   Cooper Union.
