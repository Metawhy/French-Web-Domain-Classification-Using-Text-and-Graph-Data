F1

Subsonic continuous pressurized wind tunnel, variable pressure from 1 to 3,85
bars, Mach number: from 0,05 to 0,36

A large, high Reynolds number, low speed wind tunnel with high productivity.

   F1 wind tunnel overview















   Wind tunnel designed for high productivity and test confidentiality.

   Rectangular test section:
     * length: 11 m
     * width: 4.5 m
     * height: 3.5 m

   The test section is movable and can be fitted with any of the pallets
   forming the test section floor.

BD2 : Nozzle thrust measurement

Direct-jet and reverse-jet engine nozzle and afterbody performance
characteristics.
Thrust measurement, mass low rate, pressure and distributions on single-flow
and bypass-flow models of various scales.

   BD2-test bench overview














   BD2 - Test bench overview

TYPICAL TEST

     * Nozzles or engine after bodies performance (mass flow, thrust).
     * Flow mixers (pressure and temperature maps at different distances
       downstream the nozzle exit).
     * Thrust reversers jet angularities.

TEST TECHNIQUES

   BD2-air circuit overview
   BD2 - Air circuit overview
     * This is a blow down test stand with usable air storage of 3,500 kg,
       the blow down time depends on the maximum mass flow rate through
       the model.
     * Depending on the flow rates, 6 to 8 blow downs can be run per day.
     * The primary and secondary expansion ratios are controlled
       independently.
     * Outlet jet probing capability (pressure and temperature maps at
       different distances downstream the nozzle exit).
     * Outlet jet visualization capability by carbon gas injection in the
       internal flow.
     * Flow angularities can be measured either by probing or by laser
       velocimetry.
     * Infrared signature.

CHARACTERISTICS

   Test range in hot or cold primary flow

   Test range in hot or cold primary flow
     * Forces range:
          + dynamometer thrust capacity: 9,000 N ;
          + lateral component of the thrust capacity: 1,200 N.

     * Flows range:
          + primary flow range, 16 kg/s maximum mass flow rate in cold
            condition, maximal temperature 1,150 K allowed by the stand
            structure (see the mass flow vs pressure diagram) ;
          + secondary flow range, 16 kg/s maximum mass flow rate in cold
            condition, and 1.5 kg/s maximum at 450 K.

MEASUREMENTS

   BD2-general view of the dynalpy stand
   BD2 - General view
     * Steady measurements = 96 analog channels, 16 bits A/D converter,
       digital lowpass filtering with a bandwidth from 0.01 to 10 Hz.
       Steady accuracy ±1 mV, resolution 0.3mV.
     * Unsteady measurements = 64 analog channels at 100 kHz per channel.
       12 bits A/D converter, digital lowpass filtering with a bandwidth
       from 0 to 20 kHz (if necessary the number of channels can be
       increased).
     * Steady pressures = 992 channels (by DTC PSI®, system 8400).
     * Primary flow measurement: hot or cold mass flow rate by sonic
       throat mass flow meters, when hot flow, kerosene mass flow is
       measured by piston mass flow meter.
     * Secondary flow measurement: hot or cold mass flow rate by sonic
       throat mass flow meters upstream of the heater.
     * Laser velocimetry, IR signature and visualizations on request.

   Accuracy:
     * thrust: ≤± 0.15 % of the calibration range,
     * lateral thrust component: <± 4 %,
     * mass flow: ≤± 0.1 %.
