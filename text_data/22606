   The EBMT is pleased to offer a growing number of awards and prizes for
   abstracts submitted for Oral and Poster presentation at the EBMT annual
   congress.

EBMT Physicians Group Awards and Prizes

Van Bekkum Award

   The Van Bekkum Award is the most prestigious EBMT award for the best
   abstract submitted to the physician’s programme and is selected by the

Jon J. van Rood Award

   For the Best Paper in the Immunology of Allogeneic Hematopoietic
   Transplantation in the Cellular Therapy and Immunobiology Working Party

   The induction of immunological tolerance is a major task for the
   success of organ and stem cell transplantation. Selection of the best
   donor and adequate immune suppression of both rejection and
   graft-versus-host reaction are fundamental to the success of
   transplantation. However, graft-versus-leukaemia/tumour reactions are
   crucial for the success of the treatment of leukaemia, lymphoma and
   myeloma with allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Antigenic targets
   and effector cells play a major role in tolerance and
   graft-versus-leukaemia/tumour reactions.

   Keen to foster scientific research in this area, the EBMT Immunobiology
   Working Party is pleased to offer this prestigious (€ 5,000) award for
   outstanding contributions in the field of hematopoietic transplantation
   immunology, immunogenetics, tolerance and graft-vs-leukaemia/tumour
   effects. The selection will be undertaken by a distinguished
   international jury.

   The award will be presented on an annual basis in the Cellular Therapy
   and Immunobiology Working Party Sessions at the EBMT Annual Congress.
