How to Upgrade from iPhone Running iOS 13.1 Beta to iPhone 11 or iPhone 11
Pro Without Losing Any Data

   Sep 20, 2019 - Leave a Comment

   iPhone 11 and iOS 13.1

   If you had a prior iPhone running iOS 13.1 beta releases and just got a
   new iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, or iPhone 11 Pro Max, you may have
   noticed that you can not restore the iOS 13.1 beta backup to the new
   iPhone 11 with iOS 13 device. This is because you can’t restore backups
   from new versions of iOS to older versions of iOS (and iOS 13.1 is
   newer than iOS 13.0).

   There are a few solutions to this problem; setup the iPhone as new and
   then restore when iOS 13.1 is available, or install the iOS 13.1 beta
   on the new iPhone 11 / iPhone 11 Pro and restore it from the backup.

How to Setup & Use Apple Pencil with iPad Pro

   Sep 13, 2019 - 1 Comment

   Apple pencil in-use

   The iPad Pro is already the best iPad ever made and you can take it to
   the next level by adding an Apple Pencil to the mix. But you’ll need to
   know how to set it up and get the most out of it.

   With the addition of one accessory you can turn the iPad Pro into
   perhaps the very best digital note taking machine on the planet. It’s
   not just note taking, or Notes drawing and sketching tools, either.
   With tons of other drawing and painting apps in the App Store you’re
   only limited by your imagination rather than the technology. The Apple
   Pencil might not be cheap, but it’s a great accessory if you want to
   make the best use of your iPad Pro.

Keyboard Illumination Locked? It’s the Light Sensor

   Sep 22, 2011 - 54 Comments

   Keyboard Illumination Lock icon

   Can’t turn on your MacBook Pro or Air’s keyboard backlighting? No it’s
   probably not broken, it’s most likely the light sensor. If the ambient
   light sensor on MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models detects too much
   light, the keyboard illumination will disable itself and refuse to turn
   on, showing the above locked image instead.
   [INS: :INS]

   You can force the keyboard illumination to turn back on by covering up
   this ambient light sensor, which is located directly to the left of the
   iSight/FaceTime camera on MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models:

   MacBook Air Light Sensor Location

   If you look carefully at that area on the screens border, you’ll see
   tiny perforations where light is detected. Covering the sensor will
   enable the backlit keys to turn on, usually instantly, and you can then
   adjust the backlight as usual with the F5 and F6 keys.
   Backlit keyboard illumination on a MacBook Pro or Air

   Why does this happen at ll? It’s actually a power saving feature. Your
   MacBook determines that if it’s bright enough, the glowing keys aren’t
   needed, so it disables them to maximize battery life. Now you know.

   Great question from reader Andrew O.

       Is there any way to override this? My ALS is permanently
       disconnected at the logic board (broken connector socket), so the
       computer always thinks it’s in maximum ambient light. Thanks!

       Thanks. I just needed that. Sitting by a lamp, and still needing
       backlight.
       PS: I have disabled the automatic feature in System Pref. No need
       for Lab-tick.

       I was just about to return my Macbook to the shop thinking it was
       broken!!! I wondered why the keyboard lights would come on when I
       lowered the screen down and then the keyboard lights would go out
       when I moved the screen back up. Behind me, facing the screen was 3
       halogen lights :-)

            I was thinking of doing the same thing. Bought my first mac
            (macbook air 11 inch) and only discovered this a few days
            later so I thought it was already broken but later in the day
            “miraculously” it worked again… lol

       Awesome – thanks for the Lab-tick link. I’m using it now on a well
       lit, but slightly shadowed table. The built-in sensor kept turning
       it off and I couldn’t see the keyboard or turn it back on. Now I
       have lab-tick I can! Perfect!

       here’s a question along similar lines:
       I sometimes get the same disabled icon with sound on my 27″ imac.
       is there a way to disable the external sound port altogether so it
       plays through the internal speakers?

       download “lab-tick”, it’s great for overriding apple’s lumination

       For me the problem is that everything LOOKS ok on the screen, but
       the light doesn’t lit up even if the bar is on max. If I put a
       light (a lamp) at the sensor I get the correct image above as well…
       can there be a small cable loose or something?

            Yea I always wondered that too. I thought it was strange when
            I was use my MacBoom Pro out in a “well-lit” area and I would
            attempt to adjust the keyboard light level to usually off and
            I wouldn’t be able to do so

Test a website on an iPad

   Sep 28, 2010 - 9 Comments

   test website on ipad

   Do you need to test how your website will look on an iPad, but you
   don’t have an iPad?
   [INS: :INS]

   Check out iPadPeek.com, which is a web-based iPad simulator. It’s
   limited to the web, but you can render a website in a virtual iPad in
   either horizontal or vertical orientation.

   It’s definitely not perfect but it gives a pretty accurate if not rough
   representation of how the iPad views webpages (though Flash is still
   loaded), this is definitely worth a bookmark for web developers.

   If you’re serious about developing for the iPad, you should just get an
   actual device and then download the iPad SDK, but until then this
   simulator might get you through web testing, even if it’s a bit
   limited.

       you can also use safaris user agent option from the develop menu,
       there is also an option for iphone user agent and other web
       browsers.

       Alternatively you could download Xcode and the iOS SDK and then
       you’ll have a real iPad Simulator (called iPhone Simulator, but you
       can select an iPad in the application).
       There you wouldn’t have flash, and you can scroll the site around.
       I tested my website in it, and it looks nice! :)

       It embeds a webkit iframe and sends the browser iPad as it’s OS, of
       course it will render Flash if Flash is on the page. This is a good
       representation of iPad web browsing, but not a true emulator even
       though some of the other commenters seem to think it is an iPad on
       a screen.

       I agree with Bo. You can’t call it an iPod emulator if it’s going
       to run Flash! What else is it likely to have wrong if it missed
       that major factor?

Register Hardware takes a first look at Snow Leopard

   Aug 25, 2009 - 1 Comment

   Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard

   We all know Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard is the next major version of Mac
   OS to be released in 2009, and we know some of the features too. But
   going further, the UK’s Register Hardware has a nice multipage preview
   of Snow Leopard, pointing out some changes, refinements, and new
   features.
   [INS: :INS]

   As many others have stated there’s no single new feature that is
   outstandingly groundbreaking about 10.6, it’s just heavily refined and
   quite a bit faster than Leopard.

   As always, you can pre-order Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard from Amazon.com
   for $29 which ships August 28th of ’09.

   Read the Register Hardwares first look at Snow Leopard over on
   RegisterHardware: Snow Leopard preview here.

User Created iOS Widgets Are Coming to iPhone, Apple Patent Suggests

   Jun 22, 2011 - 4 Comments

   iOS 5 Widgets

   Soon users may not need to jailbreak in order to get custom widgets on
   the iPhone with iOS 5. At least, that’s what a recent patent granted to
   Apple suggests.
   [INS: :INS]

   Multiple references of widgets, custom widgets, and user created
   widgets using a “widget creator module” are reference in the patent
   listing on the US Patent Office site (emphasis mine):

     The GPS module 135 determines the location of the device and
     provides this information for use in various applications (e.g., to
     telephone 138 for use in location-based dialing, to camera 143
     and/or blogger 142 as picture/video metadata, and to applications
     that provide location-based services such as weather widgets, local
     yellow page widgets, and map/navigation widgets).

     The applications 136 may include the following modules (or sets of
     instructions), or a subset or superset thereof: … widget modules
     149, which may include weather widget 149-1, stocks widget 149-2,
     calculator widget 149-3, alarm clock widget 149-4, dictionary widget
     149-5, and other widgets obtained by the user, as well as
     user-created widgets149-6; widget creator module 150 for making
     user-created widgets…

   This diagram from the patent displays widget references as well,
   including the Stocks and Weather widgets which are already included in
   iOS 5 beta (seen in the screen shot at the top of this post):
   Widgets mentioned in iPhone patent

   Other widgets are clearly mentioned, including a calculator, alarm
   clock, dictionary, and again there are references to “User-Created
   Widget(s)” and “Widget Creator Module”. That seems to indicate that it
   may be possible to create custom widgets directly on the iPhone itself,
   possibly similar to the Safari Web Clip tool that easily creates
   widgets for the Mac OS X Dashboard.

   The initial patent was discovered by PatentlyApple, and has since
   caused a lot of noise on the web for other reasons, but speculation on
   a patents reach is not what caught my interest.

   User created widgets in iOS 5 for iPad and iPhone without a jailbreak?
   Maybe even a widget store in iTunes? It’s just a patent so consider it
   a rumor, but let’s hope so. More customization is always a good thing.

       If this is true, and you want to make a stack of cash, listen
       closely.
       CREATE A CALENDAR WIDGET!!!!
       I can’t believe that your current day’s appointments don’t appear
       by default in the notification center. Anyone who uses iCal will
       clearly feel things have fallen short here. Any way, here’s a
       chance for someone to sell several million widgets for $0.99ea –
       start your XCoding!

            And if you don’t know Xcode, then contact me at sales at
            agicent dot com, we’ll develop that app for you. ;)

       Well, if Apple does allow widgets or any kind of iDevice mods, you
       can be very sure they’ll keep tight control over it. So, I would
       expect a central repository managed by the iron fist of Cupertino.

       I doubt we’ll see a widget store or even a central repository for
       them, but there’s probably a fair chance you’ll be able to pin
       minimal apps to the Notification Center.
