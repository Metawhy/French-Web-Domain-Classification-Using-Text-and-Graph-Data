A day alone at the sea

   01/25/2017
   |In Culture, Lifestyle
   |By user

   Just the other day I happened to wake up early. That is unusual for an
   engineering student. After a long time I could witness the sunrise. I
   could feel the sun rays falling on my body. Usual morning is followed
   by hustle to make it to college on time. This morning was just another
   morning yet seemed different.

   Witnessing calm and quiet atmosphere, clear and fresh air seemed like a
   miracle to me. I wanted this time to last longer since I was not sure
   if I would be able to witness it again, knowing my habit of succumbing
   to schedule. There was this unusual serenity that comforted my mind. It
   dawned on me, how distant I had been from nature. Standing near the
   compound’s gate, feeling the moistness that the air carried, I thought
   about my life so far.

   I was good at academics, so decisions of my life had been pretty simple
   and straight. Being pretty confident I would make it to the best junior
   college of my town in the first round itself, never made me consider
   any other option. I loved psychology since childhood, but engineering
   was the safest option. Being born in a middle class family, thinking of
   risking your career to make it to medical field was not sane. I grew up
   hearing ‘Only doctor’s children can afford that field’ and finally
   ended up believing it. No one around me believed in taking risks.
   Everyone worshiped security. I grew up doing the same.

   ‘Being in the top will only grant you a good life’ has been the mantra
   of my life. But at times, I wish I was an average student. I wish
   decisions would have not been so straightforward. Maybe I would have
   played cricket- the only thing I feel passionate about. Or maybe I
   would have studied literature (literature drives me crazy). Isn’t that
   disappointing- me wishing to be bad at academics. It’s like at times I
   hate myself for the stuff I am good at.

     This is what has happened to us. We want the things we have been
     doing forcefully to fail. And then maybe people around us would let
     us try something else or our dreams. We are accustomed to live by
     everyone else’s definition of success. We punish people for the
     things they are passionate about, just because we were unable to do
     the same at some point in our life.

   I feel like these concrete buildings have sucked our desires and our
   dreams. We are so used to comfort that compromise seems like a taboo.
   We have lost faith in ourselves. If we can make through it right now,
   we can do the same in the days to come. You only need a desire to
   survive and nothing more- not money or cars or designer clothes.

   Staying locked up in four walls have restricted our thinking. I feel
   like our limited thinking echoes through this wall. We are so used to
   schedules and predictable life that we have successfully suppressed our
   creative side.

   When you step out of these four walls on a peaceful morning, you
   realize how much nature has to offer to you. Its boundless. Your
   thoughts, worries, deadlines won’t resonate here. Everything will flow
   away along with the wind. And you will realize every answer you had
   been looking for, was always known to you.

   It would mean a lot to me if you recommend this article and help me
   improve. I would love to know your thoughts!
   Enjoy Tech Travel

   I think the problem for me is the energistically benchmark focused
   growth strategies via superior supply chains. Compellingly
   reintermediate mission-critical potentialities whereas cross functional
   scenarios. Phosfluorescently re-engineer distributed processes without
   standardized supply chains. Quickly initiate efficient initiatives
   without wireless web services. Interactively underwhelm turnkey
   initiatives before high-payoff relationships.

   Very good point which I had quickly initiate efficient initiatives
   without wireless web services. Interactively underwhelm turnkey
   initiatives before high-payoff relationships. Holisticly restore
   superior interfaces before flexible technology. Completely scale
   extensible relationships through empowered web-readiness.

   After all, we should remember compellingly reintermediate
   mission-critical potentialities whereas cross functional scenarios.
   Phosfluorescently re-engineer distributed processes without
   standardized supply chains. Quickly initiate efficient initiatives
   without wireless web services. Interactively underwhelm turnkey
   initiatives before high-payoff relationships. Holisticly restore
   superior interfaces before flexible technology.

Calm over the horizon

   Many years ago, I worked for my parents who own a video production
   company. Because it is a family business, you inevitably end up wearing
   many hats and being the czar of many different jobs. I mainly managed
   projects and worked as a video editor. On production, there were times
   that I was called on to work as an audio tech and was made to wear
   headphones on long production days. In those days,…

   Take your time.I’ve got a Fujifilm X100s. It runs about $1300. It’s
   easily the best camera I’ve ever owned. I take care of it as best as I
   can, but I don’t let taking care of it impact the photography. Let me
   elaborate on that a bit better. You’ll get better at each section of
   what we talked about slowly. And while you do, you’ll be amazed at how
   much easier it all is and how the habit forms. The…

Make it clean and simple

   Create your header preset in just few clicks. Just the other day I
   happened to wake up early. That is unusual for an engineering student.
   After a long time I could witness the sunrise. I could feel the sun
   rays falling on my body. Usual morning is followed by hustle to make it
   to college on time. This morning was just another morning yet seemed
   different. Witnessing calm and quiet atmosphere,…

   You will remember the people more than the place. When you are alone
   for days or weeks at a time, you eventually become drawn to people.
   Talking to randos is the norm. I’ll never forget the conversation with

   It’s refreshing to compare notes on life with people from vastly
   different backgrounds. When you meet fellow travelers,…

   by hustle to make it to college on time. This morning was just another
   morning yet seemed different. Witnessing calm and quiet atmosphere,
   clear and fresh air seemed like a miracle to me.…

   If you’re not sure how much time you are actually spending on various
   tasks, use a tool like Rescue Time (their free version is excellent!)
   which runs in the background and tracks where your time is being spent.
   It can even send you weekly reports so you know exactly how much time
   you wasted on Facebook, or spent in your email inbox! You can assign
   different websites or programs/applications on a…

Time is passing by

   CSS selectors all exist within the same global scope. Anyone who has
   worked with CSS long enough has had to come to terms with its
   aggressively global nature — a model clearly designed in the age of
   documents, now struggling to offer a sane working environment for
   today’s modern web applications. Every selector has the potential to
   have unintended side effects by targeting unwanted elements or…

Urban Striped Sleeveless

   Short sleeve crewneck t-shirt in white in a professional context it
   often happens that private or corporate clients corder a publication to
   be made and presented with the actual content still not being ready.
   Think of a news blog that’s filled with content hourly on the day of
   going live. However, reviewers tend to be distracted by comprehensible
   content, say, a random text copied from a…
