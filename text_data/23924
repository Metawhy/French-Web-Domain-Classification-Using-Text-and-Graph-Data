Tattoos & Piercings: A Good Idea for Vet Techs?

   by Cathy Barnette - September 23, 2019 at 10:19 PM
   [20190814_VTP_social%20media-24.jpg]

   Tattoos and piercings have become increasingly common in recent years…
   if you have one, you’re probably in good company!

   In fact, a 2010 study by the Pew Research Center found that nearly 40%
   of millenials have tattoos, with approximately 7% of millenials having
   six or more tattoos.^(1) Additionally, nearly 25% of millennials have a
   piercing somewhere other than an earlobe.^(1)

   These numbers reflect a significant increase in tattoos and piercings,
   compared to earlier generations. But, in many situations, it is
   individuals from older generations who own and run veterinary
   practices. This may lead you to wonder whether it will be easy to find
   a vet tech job with piercings or tattoos.

Stressed about the VTNE®? Try THESE Techniques!

   by Flavia Vaduva - August 19, 2019 at 9:00 AM
   [20190701_social%20media-71%20(1).jpg]

   If you’re stressed about preparing for the VTNE^® exam, you are not
   alone. Most veterinary technicians I’ve spoken to about the VTNE^® were
   in the same boat. However, their individual stress management tips were
   very different.

   Studying in different places, taking breaks and spending time with pets
   are just a few of the recommendations I heard. Undoubtedly, different
   techniques may be more effective in some individuals than in others.

   Thankfully, there are many different categories of stress management
   techniques that have been scientifically proven if you are stressed
   about the VTNE.
