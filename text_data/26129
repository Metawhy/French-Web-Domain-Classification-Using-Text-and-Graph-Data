Welcome on our English site !

   A member of the Body of European Regulators for Electronic
   Communications (BEREC), and deeply committed to the network of
   French-speaking telecommunications regulators (FRATEL) since its
   creation, Arcep is thus heavily involved in European and international
   dialogue. We are offering an English language version of our site to be
   able to sustain this dialogue with the entire ecosystem, beyond our
   national borders. On it, you will find all of our press releases,
   speeches, information about Arcep and its different departments, as
   well as all of our main publications, translated into the language of
   Shakespeare. You will also find links to other content that has not
   been translated, but which may be of interest to those of you who do
   speak French.

   Arcep In Europe and Abroad

   freedom of enterprise, freedom to innovate…

   To protect the ability to exercise these freedoms, Arcep works to
   ensure that these communication networks develop as a « common good ».
