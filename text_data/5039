A Bulldog in Big D: Louisiana Tech recruiter helps DFW students fulfill
college dreams

   Dec 22, 2014 | General News
   A fourth generation Louisiana Tech University graduate is living in
   Dallas-Fort Worth and recruiting students to become a part of Bulldog
   Country.
   Daniel Dupuy, coordinator of targeted programs for Louisiana Tech in
   the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, most often spends his days contacting
   counselors, visiting with high school students, and providing insight
   on Louisiana Tech. He is helping high school students in the area
   understand the opportunities that a college education can afford them
   and to highlight the value and return on investment that Louisiana Tech
   can offer.
   Daniel Dupuy (right) makes his home in Dallas and talks about Louisiana
   Tech with prospective student in the DFW Metroplex.

   Tech with prospective student in the DFW Metroplex.
   “I like to look at it as a way for me to hopefully give back to the
   great university that has given me so much,” Dupuy said. “Recruiting in
   Dallas-Fort Worth is a little different than recruiting from Ruston
   because I do not work in an office. I am constantly working on the road
   and from my apartment. There is a much larger pool of students to
   recruit, but a majority of them have never heard of Louisiana Tech nor
   have a clue about where we are located. For recruiting in Louisiana,
   most of the students know or at least have heard of Louisiana Tech.”
   Recent national rankings highlight return on investment (ROI), value
   and opportunities that Dupuy is sharing with prospective students.
   PayScale.com’s 2014 College ROI Report ranked Louisiana Tech University
   No. 1 among all Louisiana universities in ROI, for both in-state and
   out-of-state students. BestColleges.com recently ranked Louisiana Tech
   No. 48 in the nation in highest ROI, while AdvisorOne ranked Tech No. 1
   in Louisiana and No. 21 in the nation for best ROI.
   Dupuy is meeting the challenges of informing prospective students in
   north Texas about his north Louisiana alma mater through coffee chats,
   which gives him an opportunity to connect with students, and recruiting
   tailgates with the Alumni Center.
   “We are coordinating a recruiting event alongside the alumni center’s
   pre-game tailgate for the Heart of Dallas Bowl,” he said. “Dr. (Jim)
   King, our vice president of student advancement, made it possible for
   me to invite admitted and prospective students to this game. This will
   give them the opportunity to take advantage of seeing the Tech game day
   atmosphere and football game right here in their backyard in hopes that
   they will each bring a friend giving us more exposure to students in
   the area.”
   King said Dupuy and his mission have been well received in the
   Dallas-Fort Worth community.
   “His enthusiasm about the university is obvious, and his message seems
   to resonate with prospective students in the area,” he said. “This is a
   pilot study. We’ve never as a university managed a remote workforce;
   we’ve always had a very centralized model of recruiting. People reside
   here, and we dispatch them. We have identified markets that align well
   with Louisiana Tech in terms of our degree offerings and academic
   preparation. There are a number of markets that have promise,
   particularly north Houston and south Louisiana. There are many people
   who are unfamiliar with north Louisiana. We’ve found if they come visit
   our campus, they are so pleasantly surprised with what Louisiana Tech
   has to offer.”
   Andy Cline, assistant director of admissions, said that the recruitment
   strategy of stationing Dupuy in Dallas aligns with the university’s
   long-range goals as outlined in its Tech 2020 strategic plan.
   “In order for Louisiana Tech to meet our student recruitment goals, we
   will have to expand our markets,” Cline said. “As a Tier One national
   research university, a decision was made that in order for us to excel
   in our recruitment classes, we had to get a foothold in new markets
   outside the state of Louisiana. One of those markets is Dallas, which
   has over 5,000 Tech alumni in its population.”
   And even though Dupuy has only been in Dallas-Fort Worth since August,
   recruitment numbers are already beginning to rise.
   “Our recruitment numbers are improving,” Cline said. “Through increased
   visits and interactions with Dallas-Fort Worth area students, Daniel is
   spreading the word about Louisiana Tech University which is slowly
   improving overall awareness of students.
   Dupuy said the quality of students in Dallas-Fort Worth who meet
   Louisiana Tech’s admissions criteria, the diverse population of
   students and the number of students who meet the criteria for the
   Bulldog Out-of-State Fee Scholarship make Louisiana Tech just as
   attractive as many of the top institutions in Texas.
   “We become very attractive to most of these students through our
   Bulldog Out-of-State Fee Scholarship which will grant them in-state
   tuition by meeting the scholarship criteria,” Dupuy said. “Most of
   these students have grown up in DFW and are looking to go to school
   where they can get a more personal touch in the classroom and ways for
   them to get involved on campus. Our admissions office and campus
   departments do a great job of on-campus engagement when these students
   make the trip over for a personal visit.
   “We hope that more Dallas-Fort Worth high school students who are
   preparing to graduate will look to the east and discover the
   outstanding opportunities and value that Louisiana Tech can offer.”
