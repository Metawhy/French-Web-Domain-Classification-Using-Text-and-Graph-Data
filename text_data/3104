The only Aim of Human Life is Salvation - Spiritual Leader Rampal Ji

   Human life has been given to us to do worship of Supreme God Kabir
   Sahib. The sole aim of this human life is to achieve liberation. The
   gist of all the scriptures is, that by taking naam (mantra) from a
   Complete Guru (he who has the three naams and also the authority to
   give naam), one should get rid of the illness of birth and death, which
   in other words is called salvation or "Moksha".

   Supreme Saint Rampal Ji Maharaj is the only Complete Guru in the whole
   of this universe at this point in time who can impart the true mantra
   (initiation) to his disciples by which they can achieve salvation or
   Moksha.
