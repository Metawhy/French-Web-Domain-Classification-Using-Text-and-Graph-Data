   PRACTICAL INFORMATION

   ✓ The institute is going to undergo refurbishment, in particular to
   improve its accessibility to disabled people. The building will stay
   open during the renovation work. However, starting April 1st, 2019 and
   for several months, the cafeteria space will be shut. During that
   period it will not be possible to have any lunch or coffee breaks on
   the ground floor. The renovated space will reopen as soon as possible.
   We apologize for the inconvenience. More information will be posted
   here when available.

                                   More...
