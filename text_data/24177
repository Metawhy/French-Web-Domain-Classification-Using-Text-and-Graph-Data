   conference. It needs to include all your contact information. If you’re

   of yourself with your devices is best. Your contact number or e-mail
   should be simple to check out. I have actually seen cards that have big
   names and photos and the telephone number are so little they are tough
   to check out. Ludicrous! Make your telephone number the biggest thing
   on the card - that’s exactly what many people will utilize it for.

A Beach Wedding in Clearwater Beach, Florida

   First seen Here

     image

              (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push();

     Looking for a great destination location for your wedding that won’t
     break the bank? Try Clearwater Beach, Florida, USA! Brian C Idocks
     Photographics is a St. Petersburg, Florida based wedding
     photographer and we find ourselves working in nearby Clearwater
     Beach very often. Most of our clients who choose Clearwater Beach as
     their location for their wedding are not local, however. It might be
     due to the fact that there are a multitude of beachside resorts for
     any budget or it might be the first rate white sand beaches that
     stretch for 2.5 miles. The area offers much more so you and your
     guests can enjoy a mini vacation along with your wedding
     celebration. Shopping, restaurants as well as fun activities such as
     jet ski rentals, boat tours, miniature golf and even a “pirate ship”
     cruise can be enjoyed during your stay.

     Among the various locations in Clearwater Beach for weddings, Hilton
     Clearwater Beach is one we as professional wedding photographers
     find ourselves at often. We have photographed couples from all over
     the world at Hilton Clearwater Beach. Brooke and Jason, a couple
     from Tennessee, recently held their wedding at Hilton Clearwater
     Beach and we were honored to be their wedding photographers for the
     day. This playful couple took full advantage of Clearwater’s
     beaches, extending their stay to enjoy this special time with family
     and friends. The Hilton made arrangements for their guests easy as
     all events could happen conviently in one location, from guest rooms
     to a seaside ceremony and indoor ballroom reception.

     Here are some helpful tips for those who might choose Clearwater
     Beach, Florida as their destination wedding location:

     1) Location! Take your time and research the many venues that are
     available to you. Make certain that it can support your needs. Does
     it have enough guest rooms for you available at the time of your
     event? Do they have parking to accommodate you and your guests? Does
     the location have a ceremony site that you had in mind, be it
     beachside, garden courtyard or a nearby church? Is the reception
     area the style and price range that you have budgeted for and do
     they include food, drink, linens and any other items that you may
     require or do they have recommended vendors to provide such for you?

     2) Time of the year. Make certain you familiarize yourself with the
     Sunshine’s state’s weather patterns. Yes, we do have a hurricane
     season and when planning a wedding during these months, wedding
     insurance might be worth the investment if postponing is required
     due to a natural emergency. Some other things to keep in mind is it
     does rain. We are a sub-tropical location and we stay gorgeous and
     green due to our hot and wet weather. Always have a plan B so that
     if it does rain, your day is not completely ruined. Also keep the
     heat in mind for your and your guests comfort. If an ocean view
     ceremony and a covered patio reception is your dream wedding, then
     you might find it more comfortable to plan for an early Spring or
     Fall wedding.

     3) Time of day. We often hear couples dreaming of a sunset ceremony.
     It is a romantic notion to be sure, but as a professional wedding
     photographer, I know of the difficulty this timing might provide.
     Once the sun goes down beyond the horizon it is dark. If you are
     looking for those romantic couples portraits after the ceremony, as
     well as formal family portraits and bridal party portraits, then a
     sunset ceremony would make these occur in the darkness. You would
     either have to coordinate things so that you did these portraits
     before hand which would include a first look as these images include
     the couple as well, or you could work with the timing needs of your
     photographer and push back your ceremony, in our case, just one
     hour, to provide for the extra sun light for images after the
     ceremony. This, in my humble opinion, is the best case scenario as
     it still gives the ceremony a sunset feel, but leaves sunlight for
     the formal portraits afterward. It also keeps cost low as you won’t
     have to add all those extra hours before hand for photography.

     It has been one of a time wedding in Portugal that occurred at the
     grounds of Tivoli Seteais Palace in Sintra.
     The couple had chosen us to be their Portugal wedding photographers,
     and we couldn´t be more thrilled that we were chosen to attend this
     happy bunch that came all the way from Brazil to celebrate this
     romantic Sintra Wedding. Everything was done to perfection, and the
     couple´s guests not only took with them happy new marriage memories,
     but also a fabulous impression of the ever so romantic Sintra region
     of Portugal.

Ep. 104: A Surefire Way to Make Grandma Happy + more!

     Ah, a visit to Venice beach during sunset, what a great feeling!
     Coming from out of town, it’s a pretty nice place to be. Perhaps I
     got so wrapped up in it the moment that I had no idea what would
     happen next.

     If this rumor turns out to be true, Fujifilm might be the company
     that makes the biggest splash at Photokina this year. According to a
     new source, the long-rumored Fuji Digital Medium Format System is
     only a couple of weeks away!

     If you love those photographers who will “do anything for the shot,”
     then you’re really going to enjoy Japanese photographer snowfairy88.
     When he needs to make a splash with one of his portraits, he goes
     all in… literally.

     This must be every professional racing photographer’s nightmare:
     you’re sitting on a rickety perch, capturing the action, when a
     crash sends a flipping race car hurtling in your direction, taking
     out said perch and only narrowly missing you.

     Selfie sticks get a lot of hate these days, but one person in NYC
     took things way too far.

     Wednesday. The iPhone 7 is rumored to be announced on Wednesday, but
     not before a flood of fresh information about the unreleased Apple
     smartphone hits the Internet, including several interesting tidbits
     about the photography capabilities of the phone.

     Want to take a university-level class on digital photography for
     free? Former Stanford professor and current Google engineer Marc
     Levoy has a site containing his complete course materials for a
     class that he has taught 5 times at Stanford and once at Google.

     It’s been called the first underwater photograph and the first
     underwater self-portrait, but it doesn’t seem to be either of those
     things. No, but this photo by diver and photography pioneer Louis
     Marie Auguste Boutan, taken in 1899, does seem to be the world’s
     first underwater portrait.

     I have to admit I didn’t get too worked up when the Sony A7 and A7R
     were released. The last time I wrote about Sony it was how there
     were so few lenses for the NEX system years after introduction. So
     now we’re going to a system requiring a whole new lens mount. Sure
     the camera’s specs were interesting. But the idea of yet another
     camera body good mostly for shooting lenses on adapters wasn’t very
     exciting. So I planned to ignore it. But my friends over at
     Imaging-Resource/SLRGear were waxing poetic when they talked about
     their testing of the A7. Then they started claiming that the lenses
     were really good, too, and sent me some rather shocking test
     results. Plus, I will admit when it arrived I kind of liked the look
     and feel of the camera. It’s a very small camera for a full-frame,
     but with a nice deep grip that felt good in my overly large hands.
     Sort of a retro appearance. So even though we were a bit backed up,
     Aaron and I decided to at least run some preliminary testing in our
     Imatest lab with the A7R.

     Ever since embarking on a cross-country move last August I’ve been
     meaning to display some of my cameras and, at last, spurred by a
     recent PetaPixel post, I finally did.

     An Indian couple has been banned from climbing mountains in Nepal
     for 10 years after authorities concluded that they had faked a
     historic ascent of Mount Everest by Photoshopping other people’s
     photos.

     Want to see how a Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer responds to a
     request for free images in exchange for “credit” from a major news
     corporation? You can, because that exchange happened a few days ago.
     David Carson is photojournalist with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch who
     won the Pulitzer Prize with his paper this year for his coverage of
     protests in Ferguson, Missouri. Last Friday, Carson was contacted by
     what appears to be a CBS account on Twitter that regularly Tweets
     requests for image usage.

     National Geographic is, without a doubt, one of the foremost
     authorities in the world of photography. So when they rank their top
     10 cameras for travelers, the entire photo industry perks up its
     ears and pays special attention to see what they have to say.

     While we all sit here drumming our fingers on the counter like
     Cookie Monster in an Apple ad, waiting for GoPro to release the Hero
     5 already, Garmin just released a new action camera that’ll tempt a
     few of us to quit waiting and jump ship.

     So this was the first sunset I captured in 2012. It cost me $ 6,612
     to take this photo.

     A 17-year-old boy in Russia has died after falling 9 stories from a
     rooftop while engaging in extremely dangerous “rooftopping
     photography.” The goal of the stunt was another eye-catching photo
     for his Instagram account.

     After months of teasing and dropping hints, GoPro has finally
     revealed that its upcoming Karma camera drone will be officially
     announced on September 19th, 2016.

     Want a cheap 35mm prime lens for your Nikon F DSLR but don’t want to
     pay $ 200 for the Nikon 35mm f/1.8? The Chinese lens clone maker
     Yongnuo has just launched a 35mm f/2 Nikon F lens, and it costs just
     $ 95.

     Big news in the world of mobile phone photography today. Motorola
     just announced a new Moto Mod for its Moto Z line of smartphones.
     It’s called the Hasselblad True Zoom, and it’s an attachment that
     adds RAW photography and 10x optical zoom.

     Hello, photographers. For the last two months, I’ve been doing
     market research for my project Photolemur and looking for different
     tools in the area of photo enhancement and photo editing. I spent a
     lot of time searching, and came up with a large organized list of
     104 photo editing tools and apps that you should know about.

Wedding at Agriturismo La Capuccina on Lake Orta in San Giulio, Italy

   First seen Here

     image

              (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push();

     Today I want to tell you the story of Juliusz and Silke, a
     British-Polish couple who recently got married in Italy. They
     perfectly managed to organize their wedding in Italy in the
     beautiful frame of the Lake Orta and the town of San Giulio, doing
     the ceremony in the church of Santa Maria Assunta in the same town.
     The reception took place in Agriturismo La Capuccina. This cute
     Italian wedding venue was so good for everything: from the kindness
     of the staff to the amazing food, which was almost all produced
     locally, on the farm. A serious typical Italian great example of
     eating well! These two guys couldn’t choose better.

     The photographic style of this wedding and all the wedding I’m
     shooting this year is widely influenced by street photography and a
     sort of ironic approach to facts I see. With the exception of the
     posed session on the lake, these are all spontaneous, genuine
     photos. I hope you will like at least some pieces in this wedding
     reportage. Some of these photos are done, indeed, for photography
     lovers of a certain kind…

Tamron Updates SP 150-600mm, Intros New Tele Converters

   First seen Here

     image

              (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push();

     Tamron 150-600mm G2 Model A022 Tamron’s updated SP 150-600mm Di VC
     USD G2 (Model A022) features improved AF and VC performance, and a
     refined design to match recent Tamron primes.

     Tamron today introduced the second generation — denoted “G2” — of
     its versatile ultra-telephoto zoom, the SP 150-600mm Di VC USD G2.
     An ideal range for wildlife and sports photography, and compatible
     with both full-frame and APS-C sensor cameras, when paired with the
     latter the lens provides an incredible 233-930mm focal range. In
     addition to a refined exterior design that brings this lens in line
     with Tamron’s latest prime lenses, Tamron notes that the new lens
     includes improvements to both AF speed and accuracy, as well as
     Vibration Compensation (VC), which now provides up to 4.5 stops of
     correction. There are now three VC modes, as described in the
     official press release (below). The SP 150-600mm Di VC USD G2 has
     expected availability of late September for Canon and Nikon mount
     models, with the Sony A-mount version to arrive at a later date, at
     a retail price of $ 1,399.

     Tamron teleconverters Developed specifically for use with the new SP
     150-600mm G2 are two new teleconverters, a 2x (left) and 1.4x
     (right).

     In addition, Tamron also debuted two teleconverters designed for
     specifically for use with the new SP 150-600mm, a 1.4x and a 2x,
     which coupled with the new lens, extend the focal length to up to
     1200mm on full-frame cameras, and an astounding 1860mm on APS-C
     cameras. The teleconverters will also be available this fall at a
     retail price of $ 419 for the 1.4X and $ 439 for the 2X.

     ###

     September 1, 2016, Commack, New York – Tamron, a leading
     manufacturer of optics for diverse applications, announces the
     launch of the SP 150-600mm F/5-6.3 Di VC USD G2 (Model A022). This
     second generation “G2” lens builds upon the success of the SP
     150-600mm F/5-6.3 Di VC USD (Model A011), which launched in December
     2013 and continues to successfully meet photographers’ needs in the
     ultra-telephoto category. The new G2 version was developed to
     provide superior optical performance with today’s high resolution
     DSLRs and to add improvements to several features including speed
     and accuracy of AF and VC (Vibration Compensation). Also, several
     new features have been added: FLEX ZOOM LOCK mechanism, Fluorine
     Coating and optional teleconverters. The new lens delivers
     outstanding performance and a luxurious, upscale appearance,
     including a metal lens barrel. Delivery of the new lens in Canon and
     Nikon mounts will start on September 23 in the Japanese market and
     soon thereafter in the U.S. market (Sony A-mount to be delivered at
     a later date) at a price of $ 1399.

PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

1. Optical design refreshed to achieve even higher performance

     Three LD (Low Dispersion) lens elements completely eliminate axial
     and transverse chromatic aberrations. The design also features an
     upgraded optical construction (21 elements in 13 groups) and
     leverages improvements in manufacturing technology. As a result, the
     lens delivers high resolution, improved sharpness and overall better
     performance.

2. Tamron’s sophisticated eBAND Coating for eliminating ghosting and flare

     eBAND (Extended Bandwidth & Angular-Dependency) Coating is a
     nano-structured layer deployed on the lens element surface. In
     addition to regular anti-reflection coatings, eBAND Coating offers
     higher light transmission and significant improvement in
     anti-reflection characteristics, especially against angulated
     incident rays. Combined with BBAR (Broad-Band Anti-Reflection)
     coatings, flare and ghosting are reduced to imperceptible levels.

3. MOD reduced to provide optimum tele-macro photography

     Tamron’s advanced manufacturing technology has made it possible to
     reduce the MOD (Minimum Object Distance) to 86.6 in (2.2m), compared
     to 106.3 in (2.7m) for Model A011, and has allowed for the wonders
     of tele-macro photography with its 1:3.9 Maximum Magnification
     Ratio.

     4. AF speed is faster and much more responsive with moving subjects

     The Model A022 is equipped with a USD (Ultrasonic Silent Drive)
     ring-type motor that delivers excellent responsiveness and control.
     AF speed is significantly improved from the current model, and it
     enables accurate high-speed focus even when capturing moving
     subjects.

     When shooting with AF, the Full-time Manual Focus override allows
     you to instantly make fine-focusing adjustments manually, without
     having to switch between modes.

     5. VC performance is now 4.5 stops and offers three modes optimized
     for different situations

     The VC (Vibration Compensation) effectiveness is equivalent to 4.5
     stops, based on image stabilization performance levels established
     by CIPA (Camera & Imaging Products Association) when using VC MODE
     3. Model A022 now has three types of VC modes, and it is possible to
     choose the optimum VC mode according to the situation for taking a
     photograph, such as when panning.
     * VC MODE 1 is the standard mode that strikes a great balance between
       the stability of the viewfinder image and the stabilization
       effects.
     * VC MODE 2 is exclusively used for panning.

     * VC MODE 3 prioritizes the stabilization of the captured images and
       forgoes the stabilization of the viewfinder image.

     A new VC Mode can be programmed with the optional TAMRON TAP-in
     ConsoleTM. You can overwrite VC Mode 1 with a new VC Mode that
     allows stabilization to be engaged constantly for videography
     purposes. In this mode, the LCD screen is used.

     6. New FLEX ZOOM LOCK mechanism enables locking of the zoom ring at
     any position

     The FLEX ZOOM LOCK mechanism quickly locks or unlocks the zoom at
     any position simply by sliding the zoom ring. Photographers can
     shoot from any angle without the zoom extending unintentionally.
     Additionally, the lens features  the conventional Zoom Lock switch
     to prevent unwanted barrel extension during transportation.

     7. Fluorine Coating and Moisture-Resistant Construction for a more
     user-friendly lens

     The front surface of the lens element is coated with a protective
     fluorine compound that is water- and oil-repellent. The lens surface
     is easier to wipe clean and is less vulnerable to the damaging
     effects of dirt, dust, moisture and fingerprints. For greater
     protection when shooting outdoors, leak-proof seals throughout the
     lens barrel help protect your equipment.

     8. Electromagnetic diaphragm system now used for Nikon-mount lenses

     An electromagnetic diaphragm system, which has been a standard
     feature for Canon-mount lenses, is now employed in Nikon-mount
     lenses[1]. More precise diaphragm and aperture control is possible
     because the diaphragm blades are driven and controlled by a motor
     through electronic pulse signals.

     9. Lightweight and easy-to-hold tripod mount is compatible with an
     Arca-Swiss style quick release plate

     A new textured grip and Arca-Swiss style tripod interface enhances
     both speed and utility. And because the tripod mount is made of
     lightweight magnesium, it is much easier to carry.

     10. Compatible with TAMRON TAP-in ConsoleTM, an optional accessory
     product

     The optional TAP-in Console provides a USB connection to your
     personal computer, enabling you to easily update your lens’s
     firmware as well as customize features including fine adjustments to
     the AF and VC.

11. Teleconverters exclusively for the Tamron lens now developed

     Two exclusive teleconverters, which perfectly match the optics of
     the new SP 150-600mm G2 (Model A022), offer 1.4x and 2x
     magnification, and provide a maximum zoom range up to 1200mm. These
     new teleconverters extend focal length of the master lens, making it
     possible to take pictures in farther ultra-telephoto ranges.

12. Based on the rigorous quality standards worthy of the SP series, this new
lens is manufactured with thorough attention to details

     For the SP series products in particular, Tamron has established
     rigorous design and quality standards. These standards apply to the
     optical design, mechanical design and the cosmetic appearance, as
     well as to such wide-ranging areas as the product’s robustness and
     improvements in various individual functions. Tamron thoroughly
     reviews of all of the design and manufacturing processes in order to
     offer products to customers with ever-higher precision and quality
     levels.

     For the SP 150-600mm G2 (Model A022), the optical design was
     refreshed, mechanical parts were improved and a new exterior design
     was adopted. To maximize the optical performance intrinsic to this
     product, Tamron improved the accuracy of component parts and
     increased the precision of the overall zooming mechanism.

Design Concept

     The new design adopted for the four SP series lenses already on the
     market is essentially the fusion of engineering and style, the
     pursuit of functional beauty and craftsmanship achieved by giving
     meticulous attention to minute details. Using metal as the exterior
     material creates a high-grade design based on the concept that
