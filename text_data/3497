Testimonials

     * [Mediasquare-testimonials-8-1-e1554717885898.png]
       “Our partnership with AdLedge allows us to provide so much value to
       our customers! The process of maximizing viewability, which lies at
       the basis of good campaign performance, is inefficient at best,
       with advertisers having to pull information from different systems
       and often missing valuable mobile inventory. Thanks to AdLedge,
       mediasmart buyers can see granular viewability information in real
       time”.
       Noelia Amoedo, Chief Executive Officer - https://mediasmart.io/
     * [testimonial4-e1554718121612.png]
       “Viewability measurement is rooted in Havas DNA. This is a key
       component of any digital strategies we think of. We are extremely
       pleased to see one of our strategic partner for adverification
       obtaining the MRC accreditation for viewabilty. It reinforces our
       commitment towards advertisers for a more transparent and efficient
       advertising world”.
       Stephanie Marie, Chief Transformation Officer - Havas Media Group
