Comics at the New York Public Library

   The New York Public Library is delighted to celebrate the creative
   attributes of comics. The Library holds an extensive collection of
   comics spanning the medium’s history. Students, artists, and comic book
   aficionados visit the Library to learn about the historical, cultural,
   and visual aspects of the art of graphic storytelling—an art that
   continues to grow in popularity and reach new audiences. Shown here
   from the Library’s collections are works by the legendary comic book
   writer Stan Lee, as well as works from the James Wright Brown Cartoon
   Collection and works by Latin American, Iberian, and North American
   Latino writers and artists.

   Stan Lee
   The man who revolutionized the comic book industry and became a leading
   pioneer for the medium, Stan Lee (1922–2018) was a comic book writer,
   editor, and publisher whose work and characters are visually recognized
   throughout the world and are rising ever upward. Excelsior!

   Latin American, Iberian & U.S. Latino Comics
   In celebration of National Hispanic Heritage Month, this exhibition
   highlights Latin American, Iberian, and Latinx comics from the
   collection. The Library’s General Research Division collects broadly
   from Latin America, the Iberian peninsula, and the United States. This
   includes the Latino Comic Book Collection of over 370 comics, with
   works published from 1970 to the present.

   James Wright Brown Cartoon Collection
   In 1948, the Library was presented with the James Wright Brown Cartoon
   Collection of more than 800 original drawings by leading cartoonists
   representing the first half of the 20th century. The collection was
   donated to the Print Collection by James Wright Brown who served as
   editor-in-chief, president, and chairman of Editor & Publisher, a major
   newspaper trade journal.

   Open now. Ends October 10th, 2019. Stephen A. Schwarzman Building,

   Performing Arts.

Archive in Motion: 75 Years of the Jerome Robbins Dance Division

   The Jerome Robbins Dance Division celebrates its 75th year with an
   exhibition that charts its history and the establishment of
   international dance archival practices through the display of
   significant items from its collections.

   Originally called the Dance Collection and housed at the Stephen A.
   Schwarzman Building at 42nd Street, in the 75 years since its creation,
   The New York Public Library’s Dance Division has become the world’s
   preeminent collection of dance research materials. Renamed in honor of
   Jerome Robbins — one of the Dance Division’s greatest supporters — in
   1999, the Division not only houses its name sake's vast collection, but
   is the leading international repository for the history of dance, with
   documentation that dates back to 1453 and representation for dance of
   all styles from around the world. The archive includes irreplaceable
   film that dates back to 1897; unique designs by visual artists;
   choreographic notation; photographs; manuscript collections; shoes and
   many more examples of ephemera. When taken together, these materials
   provide the opportunity to fleetingly recapture the most elusive of the
   performing arts.



   Open now. Ends January 25th, 2020. New York Public Library for the
   Performing Arts, Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Center, Shelby Cullom
   Davis Museum, Vincent Astor Gallery

Comics at the New York Public Library

   The New York Public Library is delighted to celebrate the creative
   attributes of comics. The Library holds an extensive collection of
   comics spanning the medium’s history. Students, artists, and comic book
   aficionados visit the Library to learn about the historical, cultural,
   and visual aspects of the art of graphic storytelling—an art that
   continues to grow in popularity and reach new audiences. Shown here
   from the Library’s collections are works by the legendary comic book
   writer Stan Lee, as well as works from the James Wright Brown Cartoon
   Collection and works by Latin American, Iberian, and North American
   Latino writers and artists.

   Stan Lee
   The man who revolutionized the comic book industry and became a leading
   pioneer for the medium, Stan Lee (1922–2018) was a comic book writer,
   editor, and publisher whose work and characters are visually recognized
   throughout the world and are rising ever upward. Excelsior!

   Latin American, Iberian & U.S. Latino Comics
   In celebration of National Hispanic Heritage Month, this exhibition
   highlights Latin American, Iberian, and Latinx comics from the
   collection. The Library’s General Research Division collects broadly
   from Latin America, the Iberian peninsula, and the United States. This
   includes the Latino Comic Book Collection of over 370 comics, with
   works published from 1970 to the present.

   James Wright Brown Cartoon Collection
   In 1948, the Library was presented with the James Wright Brown Cartoon
   Collection of more than 800 original drawings by leading cartoonists
   representing the first half of the 20th century. The collection was
   donated to the Print Collection by James Wright Brown who served as
   editor-in-chief, president, and chairman of Editor & Publisher, a major
   newspaper trade journal.

   Performing Arts.

Archive in Motion: 75 Years of the Jerome Robbins Dance Division

   The Jerome Robbins Dance Division celebrates its 75th year with an
   exhibition that charts its history and the establishment of
   international dance archival practices through the display of
   significant items from its collections.

   Originally called the Dance Collection and housed at the Stephen A.
   Schwarzman Building at 42nd Street, in the 75 years since its creation,
   The New York Public Library’s Dance Division has become the world’s
   preeminent collection of dance research materials. Renamed in honor of
   Jerome Robbins — one of the Dance Division’s greatest supporters — in
   1999, the Division not only houses its name sake's vast collection, but
   is the leading international repository for the history of dance, with
   documentation that dates back to 1453 and representation for dance of
   all styles from around the world. The archive includes irreplaceable
   film that dates back to 1897; unique designs by visual artists;
   choreographic notation; photographs; manuscript collections; shoes and
   many more examples of ephemera. When taken together, these materials
   provide the opportunity to fleetingly recapture the most elusive of the
   performing arts.



   Open now. Ends January 25th, 2020. New York Public Library for the
   Performing Arts, Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Center, Shelby Cullom
   Davis Museum, Vincent Astor Gallery

   2h 1min | R

   Director: Joe Talbot


   Get to the Schomburg Center early to view the exhibition and join the
   conversation.


   EXHIBITION PROGRAMS

   Black Americans have had to “create sites of endurance, belonging, and
   resistance through social interaction” noted scholars Marcus Anthony
   Hunter, Mary Pattillo, Zandria F. Robinson, Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor in
   their 2016 article "Black Placemaking: Celebration, Play, and
   Poetry." A Ballad for Harlem Conversations explores this definition of
   black placemaking, having broad appeal for diverse, inter-generational
   audiences, and provides new perspectives on contemporary issues.

   About the Exhibition

   A Ballad for Harlem examines several strands of Black placemaking in
   the 20th century, offering views of residents and institutions
   committed to community, innovation, education, fervent political
   engagement, cultural affirmation, global perspectives, and creativity.
   Exhibition highlights include the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters,
   the Speakers Corner, items from the recent acquisitions of artist and
   activists Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis and author Ann Petry, artwork by
   contemporary Nigeria-based artist Modupeola Fadugba featuring Harlem
   Honeys and Bears, Harlem's daughter and tennis champion Althea Gibson,
   sculptures by Augusta Savage, and street scene photography of 1930s
   Harlem. Over the century that the Schomburg Center has borne witness to
   Harlem's evolution, A Ballad for Harlem offers contemplation now in the
   midst of gentrification as new comers and long-time residents navigate
   the liminal space--a transition between what was and what is to come.

   Please contact us immediately for American Sign Language (ASL)
   interpretation. Requests can be made by calling 212-340-0951 or
   212-340-0909, or e-mail accessibility@nypl.org.

   Local Voices Network conversation

   The New York Public Library is launching an exciting new initiative
   this fall, in collaboration with the Local Voices Network (LVN).

   Library staff and community partners will record neighborhood
   conversations on the issues important to New Yorkers. These recordings
   will then be shared on a searchable website for journalists,
   decision-makers, and other local stakeholders to tune into the
   community’s real concerns. Together, we’ll create a platform where
   anyone and everyone is invited to speak and be heard.

   Join us at Countee Cullen Library to learn more about LVN and celebrate
   Arts Advocacy Week in Harlem with a Poetry Jam session!

   Here’s what you can expect at the Harlem LVN Kick-Off:
     * Listen to opening poems from local writers.
     * Test out the Digital Hearth, a recording device for group
       conversations.
     * Share your ideas for how we should build this project in Harlem.
     * Ask staff from The City about how local news can best reflect your
       community.
     * Sign up to participate in a recorded conversation, become a
       volunteer host, or partner with us.

   Sign up HERE  e-mail nyc@lvn.org. RSVPs are necessary for this event. A
   light dinner will be served.

   About the Local Voices Network:

   The Local Voices Network project aims to bring the perspectives and
   concerns of everyday New Yorkers to light through facilitated community
   conversations that invite anyone and everyone to the table to share and
   listen. Conversations are recorded and transcribed with the goal of
   offering media, local leadership, and the greater public a new window
   into the most important community issues. Learn more at our
   website lvn.org.
