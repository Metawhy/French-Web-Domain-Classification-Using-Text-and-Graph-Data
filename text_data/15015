Dachshunds In Film: The Lemon Drop Kid

   [lemon+drop+kid.jpg]
   A cold Bob Hope steals Fifi's sweater
   If you're looking to watch a classic Christmas movie this year, one
   with say, oh, a Dachshund in it, look no further than The Lemon Drop
   Kid starring none other than Bob Hope, and introducing the world to a
   song none other than Silver Bells.  That's right.  'Shelby,' 'Hope',
   and 'Scooby' write:
   Dear Rowdy and Bette,
   Tis the season to be watching Christmas movies! We watched "The Lemon
   Drop Kid" with Bob Hope the other night and to our mutual amazement
   there is a very funny scene with a long-haired wiener dog in it!
   Perhaps you already know about this, but it took us by a nice surprise!
   The voice-over did not sound very like a Dachshund barking but we'll
   excuse them this considering how sweet a film it is.
   If you want to check out the Dachshund scene, and we know you do, click
   on this youtube link, we've got it all queued up to start at the very
   best part.

   Big ol' film-hound rescue 'Scooby' is the newest member of his pack.
   Ain't he a handsome boy?  Congrats to his family!

Christmas Fun in the Sun Down Under

   [down+under.jpg]
   'Mason' and 'Kai' picked up their fashionable holiday attire at their
   local K-Mart.

   Dozens of Dachshunds recently got together to enjoy the warm weather
   and celebrate Christmas Down Under at the annual Dachshunds in Paradise
   holiday meet-up in the Gold Coast, Australia.  Dachshunds in Paradise
   is a local meet-up group which "gathers to celebrate their petite pups
   and to raise money to help find homes for neglected dachshunds."
   Read more, see more pics, and hear audio from the event at ABC.com.

Flipper Dachshund Scene

   IFRAME: //www.youtube.com/embed/WEmW2crmS_s?rel=0

   Rounding out this retro weekend at The Long and Short of it All, here's
   that Flipper episode you thought you had just dreamed about - the one
   with the smooth black and tan Dachshund swimming with our aquatic
   Lassie.  You weren't dreaming - it was as real as the whiskers on your
   furry little schnoz.
   Video by youtuber Doria Biddle.
   They call him Flipper, Flipper, faster than lightning,
   No one you see, is smarter than he,
   And we know Flipper, lives in a world full of wonder,
   Flying there under, under the sea!

Dachshunds in Film: Bachelor Flat

   IFRAME: //www.youtube.com/embed/1pRu55jkbG4?rel=0

   Hold on to your seats Dachshund fans, looks like it's going to be a
   retro weekend here at The Long and Short of it All!  Thanks so much to
   our good pal 'Trinket' for writing in about the 1962 American comedy
   Bachelor Flat.  She pens:
   Dear Rowdy and Bette,
   I recently stumbled on this while looking up some information about the
   holiday movie "Susan Slept Here" starring Debbie Reynolds. It turns out
   that the movie’s director remade the film as "Bachelor Flat" a few
   years later in the early 60s. One of the roles in Bachelor Flat is
   played by 'Jessica' the Dachshund. The whole movie isn’t on youtube,
   but this is a great clip of her and a dinosaur bone. What would a small
   dog do when confronted by a huge bone?  Jessica, btw, is billed in the
   opening credits.
   The plot, via Wikipedia:
   A charming British anthropology Professor Bruce Patterson
   (Terry-Thomas) has to live with Helen Bushmill (Celeste Holm), his
   fiancée. Helen is away traveling, and has failed to tell him that she
   has a seventeen-year-old daughter Libby (Tuesday Weld), who shows up at
   her mother's home unaware that Helen is engaged. Meanwhile he has to
   resist the advances of the neighbourhood ladies who barge in
   unexpectedly. At the same time, Patterson must deal with the continual
   invasions of his cynical neighbor, and law student, Mike (Richard
   Beymer), who soon develops a crush on Libby. Intertwined in the story
   is Mike's persistent Dachshund, determined to bury the professor's
   prize possession of a rare dinosaur bone. Director Frank Tashlin said
   he included the Dachshund as a satire on CinemaScope due to the dog's
   shape.
   Better get this film on your must-watch list!   At the time
   Variety called it a "frivolous, farcical concoction" and credits much
   of the great comedy to the supporting cast.  They added "The Dachshund,
   incidentally, is an accomplished low comedienne."  Of course she is.

DECORATION FOR A HERO

   [war+hero2.jpg]
   Meet 'Adolph' and his Human, Stephen Sweeney, 1959
   Dear Gentle Readers,
        Please pardon our absence as of late, but we've had some family
   emergencies in the last few weeks and haven't been able to provide any
   updates.  We haven't even been near a computer for weeks on
   end.  Things are not good, although thankfully they are improving -
   Dachtober, so much to answer for.
        But today is Veterans Day 2013, and as we have done on Memorial
   Day and Veterans Day for all of our years here at The Long and Short of
   it All, we take time to honor those who served in the armed forces -
   and the Dachshunds who stood by their side.
        So let's head back to August 19th, 1959, where this handsome
   little War-Hero Dachshund-mix was honored with a gold collar as
   Newsday's Pet of the Year.  Here's how it all went down:
   Sgt. Adolph Sweeney, a distinguished "war hero," was called front and
   center again today - perhaps for the last time - to receive the
   accolade of civilian Long Island.  Voters named him Pet of the Year in
   Newsday's annual Golden Collar contest.
   The 17-year-old Dachshund-Beagle, who suffers from serious heart
   trouble since an attack last March, apparently won the hearts of
   voters.  They gave him more than triple the votes of his nearest
   competitor, the tiger-cat Mr. Peepers.
   Adolph, owned by Stephen Sweeney, a chauffeur of 30 Madison Ave,
   Franklin Square, New York, brought to this year's competition an
   exciting war record.
   He flew 39 World War II missions over Germany with his master, a
   veteran of the Army Air Corps.  Adolph was presented with the same
   medals that Sweeney earned:  the Air Medal with five oak leaf clusters,
   the Distinguished Flying Cross, and other citations.  As mascot of a
   B-17 Flying Fortress, he logged 800 hours flying time from bases in
   Italy, England, and North Africa.
   "But this award," said his master yesterday, "is the best.  It gives me
   something awfully nice to remember him by."
   In the last few years, Sweeney explained, Adolph's health has slipped
   badly.  "He lost his hearing completely two years ago," Sweeney said.
   "Then that heart attack in March.  He just won't be around much longer,
   that's all."  Adolph's age is comparable to 84 years of a human life,
   it was estimated by a spokesman at Farmingdale Animal Hospital.
   Largely on the basis of his dramatic story, Adolph was selected by
   Newsday judges as the sixth Pet of the Week.  Then readers voted him
   Pet of the Year.  He will receive a solid gold collar to mark this
   title.

Dachshund Love Stories: Meet Frank

   Kisses!
   By Stacy Jacob Photography, who notes:  What can be cuter than this
   little guy, so full of love to give. And such a smart cookie, he sure
   knew how to pose for the camera. I think my favorite thing was his
   reaction to his "Sandwich Kiss".

The Weatherman's Little Wiener

   IFRAME: //www.youtube.com/embed/SNv_fKwFqnA?rel=0

   Oh, the trials and tribulations of being a Dachshund Lover.  This video
   went viral last week according to Alabama meteorologist Mark Prater's
   facebook page:
   When we had our video blooper "little wiener" last week, I had a lot of
   folks tell me it would go viral. Little did I know what viral REALLY
   meant.
   CBS Network - CBS This Morning
   Jay Leno - The Tonight Show
   Top Video - Daily Mail UK - London
   Fox News: Special Report - with Brett Baier
   VH1
   We've lost count of how many radio stations (especially national shows)
   across the country.
   1.8 million websites in the past 7 days!

   [the+Colonel.jpg]
   And see....like all good Wieners, Mr. Prater's Dachshund 'The Colonel'
   DOES get dressed up!
