Seattle Green Factor

What Is It?

   Seattle Green Factor is a score-based code requirement that increases
   the amount of and improves the quality of landscaping in new
   development. Landscaping plays an important role in how new development
   looks and functions. Well-designed landscaping:
     * Improves the look and feel of a neighborhood
     * Reduces stormwater runoff
     * Cools cities during heat waves
     * Provides habitat for birds and beneficial insects
     * Supports adjacent businesses
     * Decreases crime

   If your project is required to meet the Seattle Green Factor, you must
   reach a minimum score established by the zoning of your property. You
   can choose from a “menu” of landscape credits for various features,
   including green roofs, rain gardens, vegetated walls, and trees, and
   shrubs. You can receive bonus credits if you plant along the sidewalk,
   use native plants, or create a food garden.

   For case studies of how the Seattle Green Factor can be applied to a
   project, see our Seattle Green Factor archive page.

What It Isn't

   Green Factor does not cover regulations for single-family zones and
   some industrial and downtown zones.

Read the Code

   The standards of Seattle Green Factor are established in Seattle
   Municipal Code (SMC) 23.86.019. Detailed requirements for affected
   zones are as follows:
     * Commercial and Neighborhood Commercial (NC1, NC2, NC3, C1, C2):
       Minimum score 0.30 (SMC 23.47A.016)
     * Industrial Commercial (IC) within urban village or urban center
       boundaries: Minimum score 0.30 (SMC 23.50.038)
     * Development in South Downtown (variety of zones within the South
       Downtown planning area): Minimum score of 0.30 for development with
       20,000 gross square feet or more (SMC 23.49.031)
     * Midrise and Highrise Multifamily Residential (MR, HR): Minimum
       score 0.50 (SMC 23.45.524)
     * Lowrise Multifamily Residential (LR): Minimum score 0.60 (SMC
       23.45.524)
     * Yesler Terrace (MPC-YT): Minimum score of 0.30 per development,
       0.50 per sector (SMC 23.75.160)
     * Seattle Mixed (SM): Minimum score of 0.30 (SMC 23.48.055)

Seattle Green Factor

What Is It?

   Seattle Green Factor is a score-based code requirement that increases
   the amount of and improves the quality of landscaping in new
   development. Landscaping plays an important role in how new development
   looks and functions. Well-designed landscaping:
     * Improves the look and feel of a neighborhood
     * Reduces stormwater runoff
     * Cools cities during heat waves
     * Provides habitat for birds and beneficial insects
     * Supports adjacent businesses
     * Decreases crime

   If your project is required to meet the Seattle Green Factor, you must
   reach a minimum score established by the zoning of your property. You
   can choose from a “menu” of landscape credits for various features,
   including green roofs, rain gardens, vegetated walls, and trees, and
   shrubs. You can receive bonus credits if you plant along the sidewalk,
   use native plants, or create a food garden.

   For case studies of how the Seattle Green Factor can be applied to a
   project, see our Seattle Green Factor archive page.

What It Isn't

   Green Factor does not cover regulations for single-family zones and
   some industrial and downtown zones.

Read the Code

   The standards of Seattle Green Factor are established in Seattle
   Municipal Code (SMC) 23.86.019. Detailed requirements for affected
   zones are as follows:
     * Commercial and Neighborhood Commercial (NC1, NC2, NC3, C1, C2):
       Minimum score 0.30 (SMC 23.47A.016)
     * Industrial Commercial (IC) within urban village or urban center
       boundaries: Minimum score 0.30 (SMC 23.50.038)
     * Development in South Downtown (variety of zones within the South
       Downtown planning area): Minimum score of 0.30 for development with
       20,000 gross square feet or more (SMC 23.49.031)
     * Midrise and Highrise Multifamily Residential (MR, HR): Minimum
       score 0.50 (SMC 23.45.524)
     * Lowrise Multifamily Residential (LR): Minimum score 0.60 (SMC
       23.45.524)
     * Yesler Terrace (MPC-YT): Minimum score of 0.30 per development,
       0.50 per sector (SMC 23.75.160)
     * Seattle Mixed (SM): Minimum score of 0.30 (SMC 23.48.055)

       Green scoring system in SMC 23.86.019
