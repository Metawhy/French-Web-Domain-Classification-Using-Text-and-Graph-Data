   Human-Computer Interaction
   Machine Learning / AI
   Interactive Arts
   Skill Learning

   I am conducting interdisciplinary research in Human-Centred Machine
   Learning, at the intersection of Human-Machine Interaction and Machine
   Learning. I am particularly interested in the context of embodied
   interaction for artistic practices and skill acquisition.

   I am currently a CNRS Research Scientist (CR1) at LRI, University
   Paris-Saclay and a AI consultant at Mogees ltd. I received a PhD in
   Computer Science from University Pierre et Marie Curie and IRCAM in
   2012. From 2012 to 2015, I worked at Goldsmiths College, University of
   London, as a research associate. In 2015 I joined the London-based
   start-up Mogees Ltd. as Senior Research Scientist. From 2016 - 2018, I
   was a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Research Fellowship between McGill
   University (Montreal) and IRCAM.
