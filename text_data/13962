Hollywood Regency Bathroom Redo

   Hollywood Regency Bathroom Redo
   Slowly over the last 2 years I have been redecorating my house from one
   end to the other.
   Next up.....The guest bathroom
   [100_0866.JPG]
   When I bought the house 11 years ago, it had the original 1984 blue
   bathroom.
   When I moved in I redid it to reflect the shabby cottage look I had in
   the rest of the house.
   [Screen%2Bshot%2B2016-10-25%2Bat%2B2.48.10%2BPM.png]
   I just finished giving it ANOTHER make over
   [100_0865.jpg]
   I kept all of the fixtures, removed the wallpaper (What a pain) and
   painted the walls "Cement Grey"
   [100_0870.jpg]
   Then it was just a matter of glamming it up....A fancy
   Bed Bath and Beyond shower curtain
   I used the same shelf........
   [100_0879.JPG]
   .......And added some fancy new hand towels
   [100_0878.JPG]
   And a blinged up soap dispenser
   [100_0882.JPG]
   The total investment was $150 and sweat equity
   [100_0865.jpg]
   Not a huge change, but not a huge investment either!

   [Screen%2Bshot%2B2016-10-27%2Bat%2B1.48.41%2BPM.png]
   The same bathroom 3 ways.  Reflecting my ever evolving taste in
   decorating
   Next up.....The office, I am almost finished and will show you soon.
   Happy Creating!

Photos of the Polka Dot Flea

   Thank you for all of your kind comments on my last post about the
   Orlando Tragedy.
   As Orlando continues to pull together, I wanted to share pictures from
   the Polka Dot Flea on Saturday June 11th.

   [9.jpg]
   We try to keep a diversity of vendors...True antiques, guy stuff,
   bohemian, jewelry, artsy.....Big stuff, little stuff....Something for
   everyone!
   I'll be quiet so you can enjoy the booths of our fabulous vendors.

   Saturday was such a fun day!  Sunday we had a dark cloud.
   Vintage Finds Magazine Published pictures of the Polka Dot Flea in
   their June/July issue and asked us to include a paragraph....This
   really sums up the show.
   "Orlando and Beyond,
   The Polka Dot Flea is only as successful as our "best of the best"
   vendors and shoppers. Thank you for giving us another amazing Saturday,
   and being present Sunday as we all learned together the breadth of the
   tragedy that unfolded the night before.  Every year, we strive to be
   better than the last, but next year will definitely have special
   meaning.  The Polka Dot Flea will strive to make 2017 our best event
   yet, and help show that we in Orlando are committed to doing the things
   we love to do by remaining #OrlandoStrong.  Thank you again to all of
   our vendors and lovers of all things vintage, upcycled, rusty, shabby,
   and otherwise.  You are the soul of the Polka Dot Flea and we
   appreciate each and every one of you!"
