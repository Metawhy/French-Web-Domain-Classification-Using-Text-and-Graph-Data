   [podcastIcon.gif] Java Posse #461

So long… and thanks for all the awesome!

   Fully formatted shownotes can always be found at http://javaposse.com


   The Last Ever episode of the Java Posse, recorded in front of a live
   audience at Devoxx, several months ago.


   Video version on www.parleys.com (recommended as there’s lots of visual
   action)


   For follow up news, please subscribe to http://www.voxxed.com/ news,
   where we will announce any updates about former posse members as they
   live out their rock and roll retirement, trashing hotel rooms, throwing
   up in the back of ambulances, and trying to make desperate comebacks no
   matter what the cost to pride.

Roundup ‘13 - Devops and Culture Change

   Fully formatted shownotes can always be found at http://javaposse.com

   Extra thanks to D.J. Hagberg for the excellent and complete show notes.

   - Netflix "Freedom & Responsibility" - Every team can organize as they
   choose

   - "Firemen" who get paged when system goes down.  Sets best practices

   - "Site Reliability Team" - sets best practices: deployment,
   monitoring, ...

   - "Cloud Performance Team" - sets best practices for cloud performance

   - Groovy

   - Python

   - Standarization: set up practices/tools such that choosing the
   "Standard" makes life easier

   - Regulatory constraints (Sarbanes-Oxley, PCI DSS)

   - Communication with Devops: Build, Deploy, Release

   - Documentation: in many cases, auditors are happy with scripts

   - tl;dr

   - Adrian Cockcroft - InfoQ, YouTube, @adrianco

   - Opportunities for Ops to deploy systems, devs to assist & learn from
   Ops

   - #monitoringsucks

   - Uptime and Availabitility - metrics

   - Wake up the developer at 3am when they break things. Devs need to
   understand Operational Risk of changes

   - PCI Compliance mitigation ideas

    . Separate out the SOX/PCI regulated parts of application, pared down
   to most minimum possible

    . Put those parts under separate accounts, machines, audit trails,
   etc.

   - Metrics: what do you use to measure? Customer Happiness, Money,
   Loyalty?  (Netflix: "movie start metric")

   - Adobe Cloud Services

   - Quicken cloud

   - Twitter - measure sentiment (for consumer-facing/high-profile
   services)

   - Automation: bite-size, recoverable pieces

   - Eiffel design-by-contract concept: preconditions/postconditions

   - Redefining the job of operations

   - Executive sponsorship

   - QA does the deployment through DevOps-provided tools

   - Post-Mortem, military AAR, Incident Review, Agile Retrospective: have
   thresholds for Big Meetings vs small outages/rollbacks

   - Metric: time to get new feature to the customer

   - Self-directed improvement: Deming/Lean improvement cycles - Kaizen

   - Visible Ops Handbook - Gene Kim

   - The Phoenix Project (book) - Gene Kim

   - business Case for improvements?  What was cost of the last outage?

   - Chase Manhattan - 3 day outage in 2010

   - Every business in the future will be a software business

   - Move developers into Ops teams - Google engineers get extra "hazard"
   pay/leather jacks - DevOps Culture Hacks

   - Practices brought back from Ops to Dev

    . JMX: Measure/Instrument *all* the things (esp. consumer facing)
   [g2rciVk3nY4fFMqTO0wkLRPkTUAtakmqweXNCpdvUy1gKrGqs6m_PHIW4baHwvL4zooA3D
   yPlhiN8ZlS_eDTPhhdYE45Ut0lS5JC2snm1gH2UimfAWXxYUgM7A]

    . Vagrant/Opscode Chef/Puppet stack into Dev environment - exercise
   deployment on every Dev change.

   - "Foreign Exchange" (hostage exchange?) program

   - "Don't make customers modify XML Files"

   - Static Config to Files.  Stays the same for release.

   - Dynamic Config - looked up from service - Archaius - Netflix

   - Feature Switches/Feature Flags - Etsy

    . Enable/disable features & settings at runtime

    . Hierarchical/tagged/scoped configurations

    . Use config changes for rollback

   Java Posse Unofficial JavaOne Party tonight

   As I mentioned on the last Java Posse podcast, our planned JavaOne
   party fell through due to no one's fault but my own (too busy with new
   company, let things go unmanaged too long, etc.). We will make up for
   it at Devoxx this year, but in the meantime we will instead have a get
   together tonight (Monday 1st Oct) at Kate O'Brien's Irish Pub in San
   Francisco. Because of another thing going on, we won't be out there
   until 11ish but that shouldn't stop you getting into the mood before we
   arrive if you want to.

   Kate O'Brien's details are here: http://www.kateobriens.com/

   We will aim to be there by 11, but could be a shade later depending on
   circumstances beyond our control. Rest assured that we will put in a
   showing however, we might even get there early - stranger things have
   happened.

   Thanks, and sorry for dropping the ball on a more official presence at
   JavaOne - all I will say is that being your own boss is a surprising
   amount of work.

   [podcastIcon.gif] Java Posse #389 - Roundup '12 - Pair Programming
   Variations

Roundup '12 - (Variations in) Pair Programming (Variations)

   Fully formatted shownotes can always be found at http://javaposse.com
   Pair Programming is hard, because it’s social.  In this session hosted
   by Dianne Marsh and Andrew Harmel-Law we discuss different approaches
   to adopting this agile practice. Thanks to Todd Costella, Jack Leow,
   Eirik Bjørsnøs, Chris Marks, D.J. Hagberg, Brian Gray and Victoria
   Vickers for their valuable input.
   Recorded at the Java Posse Roundup 2012 in Crested Butte, CO
   Thanks to Andrew Harmel-Law for production help.
     * A Pair Programming Tarot

     * The Pair Programming Rules (from extremeprogramming.org)
     * The Pair Programming Idioms (from extremeprogramming.org)
     * A Pair Programming Tarot Lightning Talk (youtube)
     * A Pair Programming Tarot Slides (slideshare)

     “Two Brains and Two Sets of Hands”
     * Pair programming with personal input devices,
     * but shared and mirrored screens

     Adoption
     * Developer led versus “militant” “all-pair-programming-all-the-time”
     * In our experience its not always appropriate to use it

     The Importance of the physical space
     * The desk and chair layout

     The problem with “the rest of your job”
     * How do you fit in other, non-pair tasks like email, calls, lunch,
       etc?

     Pair Programming Remotely ON PURPOSE
     * Google Hangouts
     * Plus “your own space”
     * Good relationships make this a minor / non-existent barrier to
       success
     * Not every day, also work co-located regularly

     The “@Debt thing” example
     * The @Debt project Wiki and Code (Kenai)
     * Windows Livemeeting
     * Importance of good relationships
     * And importance of ability to think out loud

     Impact on Planning
     * Plan in pairing at estimation stage
     * “2x2” - 2 people for 2 hours
     * Record the time for both people for the whole time
     * Problem: How to handle it if not planned in - do we both record
       time against the task?
     * Option 1: stop estimating at Task / hour level

     * Just focus on Story Points / Sprint for your team
     * You can still break a Story into Tasks to visualise your work and
       allocate it, but don’t estimate them
     * This is slightly “black box” Sprint-level progress reporting

     Pairs of different skill levels
     * It works best with people of similar skill levels

     * But this is not the only way

     Benefits of onboarding and knowledge sharing

     But you can’t tolerate egos
     * Which you are more likely to see in the expert

     Remember this skills transfer ought also to include the skills of
   pairing itself

     Mindfull Programming
     * Being aware of yourself as you program
     * And also being aware of the other half of your pair as you program
     * Teach without making the other half feel they are stupid

     How to pair up?
     * What if you have odd numbers of people?

     * Rotate pairs every day
     * Culture of “you must pair with everyone else within a Sprint”

     Just let them decide themselves
     * On a task-by-task basis
     * On an ad-hoc basis

     Sitting next to someone while they program is not pair programming

     Letting go of Driver / Navigator
     * When you’re really flowing as a pair, you’re both Driving and both
       Navigating
     * You’re really collaborating
     * How to get there?

     * Use the Ping Pong Idiom: One person writes a test, the other person
       implements it
     * Break through egos by writing a test which breaks the thing just
       written
     * Liked this on Code Retreat

     But what if the skill gap is too large?
     * Don’t be dogmatic
     * If it’s not working, just STOP

     Pair Programming in Interviews
     * Chance to reduce stress of interviewee at every opportunity

     Adoption Techniques (when none of you are experienced Pair
   Programmers)
     * Deliberate practice
     * Workshop with tasks (the TDD Katas are good for this)
     * A few lightning talks before (about pairing approaches)
     * Experiment and mix the pairs
     * Reduce the amount of “reality”

     Corey Haines
     * Code Retreat - Jim Hurne gives a lightning talk about Code Retreats
       at JPR2011

     Challenging the assumptions of “different skill levels”
     * This introduces the ego right there
     * Instead value the spectrum of skills that each person comes from
     * John the UI Guy’s website: www.ilikepixels.co.uk

     Managing the bits in between the pair programming sessions
     * I.e. synching the non-programming schedules of the pair
     * Nothing in the available literature seems to talk about this
     * But how do you manage it?
     * One of the pair is almost always having to think about personal
       life stuff they need to do
     * Explicitly schedule it it
     * And also don’t pair all time - it’s HARD WORK

     Difference from working individually
     * Individually you can turn lots of your brain off - e.g. the social
       bit
     * But in Pair Programming this is very much on
     * WHich is draining
     * But it can also be addictive

     Certified Scrum Developer
     * www.scrumalliance.org/pages/certified_scrum_developer

     * Ron Jeffries
     * Chet Hendricksen

     Pairing with non-Programmers
     * Business experts
     * Testers
     * Operations

     Non-Verbal Cues
     * Pairing when one person is standing and the other sitting
     * Body language has a role to play
     * Home field advantage - always pairing at one half of the pair’s
       desk

     Pairing Stations
     * Gets round the problem of using some else’s setup

     * Different IDE setup
     * Different keyboard
     * Mac / Windows

     Don’t make me think

     International Pairing
     * The problems of Finnish keyboard mappings

     Sharing code with a DVCS (like git) to get round the someone else’s
   setup problem
     * “Push” and share the code when you swap
     * Makes you think in logical pieces of work

     Frequency of Control Switching
     * “It depends”

     “Trio Programming”
     * One coding, two writing tests
     * Everyone has a different views of the world

     Advantage of cycling pairs - everyone knows all the code
     * And more than the code; involve the DBA too

     Disadvantage of cycling pairs - context switching
     * to begin with this is the case
     * but then you got a better view of the codebase
     * the code looked like a team had written it

     The positive social pressure of pairing
     * Builds better code
     * Counters the risk of over-engineering
     * The angel on your shoulder
     * N.b. it can go the other way - but most folks are aware of our own
       failings

     Lack of Resources
     * pairwith.us (not “pairwith.me” as mentioned)

     How much Pairing?
     * You can burn out
     * It can be relentless when you’re learning it
     * It challenges a lot of your introversion
     * Take small bites
     * Find the pair tasks

     Breaking down tasks
     * At Sprint planning
     * It’s an art
     * Keep breaking things down
     * Waiting until the “last responsible moment”

     Remember it’s about finding the sweet spot for your team - it’s the
   variations
     * Team dynamic specific
     * Project specific
     * Company culture specific
     * It depends

     A culture of self-organising teams will avoid lots of the potential
   problems you might find in adoption

     * Test Driven Development

     * Red / Green / Refactor - it is a very deliberate process
     * Test Driven Development: By Example (Kent Beck) - Amazon
     * Remember the “D” stands for “Driven” - designing the API at the
       lowest level
     * There is a lot of emotional language in the book
     * The “smallest possible increment” adoption method
     * Martin Fowler’s Afterword to “TDD: By Example” - Google Books
     * TDD as if you meant it -
       http://www.infoq.com/presentations/TDD-as-if-You-Meant-It
     * Stop and think about it
     * Are you in the proper state of mind to be developing? - E.g. are
       you too tired?

     * Check by writing tests

   [podcastIcon.gif] Java Posse #387 - Roundup '12 - NoSQL

Roundup '12 - NoSQL

   Fully formatted shownotes can always be found at http://javaposse.com
   This session discusses the usage of NoSQL data stores within Java
   applications and the experiences developers have had resulting from
   that endeavor.
   A conclusion seems to be that the selection of the best data store for
   your application is quite dependent on the type of data that you are
   storing: XML vs. JSON, many small items vs. large documents,
   relationships with sibling data items, or its volatility to aspects
   such as consistency, availability, and partitioning (CAP).
   Another observation was that through the use of a Factory type pattern
   the type of underlying data store could be abstracted away from the
   applications.  Use of JPA annotations, Mongo annotations, or
   identifiers for other storage types would be selected by setting a
   configuration switch.

     * Project of the week - VisualLangLab

     * If you are observing the crop of new languages springing up at
       present (like Kotlin, Ceylon, etc.) and think to yourself "I could
       do better than that", well, now's your chance.
     * VisualLangLab is a graphical tool for designing language grammars.
     * The tool gives you the ability to examine the resulting abstract
       syntax tree from a code snippet passed through your grammar, and
       helps you write the grammar you want.
     * And it's not just for full blown languages. The project could be
       used for developing free-form domain specific languages just as
       easily.
