   Article 2: Products

    2.1 – Descriptions

   The Products represent all of the goods offered for sale by
   PrivateSportShop on its Website.

   The Products offered by PrivateSportShop comply with current French
   legislation and standards applicable to France.

   PrivateSportShop provides its Customers with technical and practical
   information for each Product. This information is passed on by the
   supplier from whom the Company purchases its Products﻿.
   PrivateSportShop commits to provide graphics that represent the Product
   faithfully. However, in some instances, it may be possible that the
   physical Product does not completely match the digital image. The best
   before date concerning perishable products, as well as the duration of
   the guarantee are also indicated on the product page.


   2.2 –Product Prices

   Three different elements are indicated concerning the pricing for each
   Product: the reference price, the reduced price and the discount
   percentage. The reference price corresponds to the sales price usually
   applied by the competition, considering that the reference price does
   not account for sales prices or any reductions. PrivateSportShop will
   do all it can to modify this rate to reflect the French market.
   PrivateSportShop reserves the right to modify its rates at any time. In
   this case, the price charged when submitting the final order will be
   valid.

   Delivery within Metropolitan France and the European Union:

   The sales prices are given in Euro, including taxes and do not include
   shipping costs. Shipping costs are indicated on the Website, during the
   purchase process, before final submission of the order.

   Delivery to French Overseas Departments and outside the European Union:

   The sales prices are given in Euro, excluding taxes and do not include
   shipping costs. Shipping costs are indicated on the Website, during the
   purchase process, before final submission of the order.

   For delivery outside of Metropolitan France, the provisions stated in
   the French general tax code are applicable regarding VAT. The order
   will therefore be subject to the relevant customs duties and any
   potential taxes. PrivateSportShop is not obliged to inform its members
   of the relevant customs duties and taxes and, therefore, the Company
   will not be held responsible for these charges or conditions.

   2.3 – Product Availability

   In the event of a Product’s unavailability following a stock shortage
   with a supplier, the Customer will be informed by email.

   The Customer may be offered two possible solutions, according to the
   stock available.

   - An offer of replacement with an identical or higher range product
   that he/she will have the option of accepting or refusing in exchange
   for a refund. It is agreed ﻿that the Company will cover the shipping
   costs for the new product, where applicable.

   - A refund for the price of the product or service ordered within
   fourteen days of notification about the item’s unavailability. A refund
   of all or part of the order will be made within a maximum of fourteen
   days. This refund will be made using the same method as that used by
   the Customer to pay at the time of purchase: either monetary (credit
   card or PayPal), voucher or both. If a discount code was used, this
   amount will not be refunded.﻿


   ﻿Article 3: Ordering

   3.1 – Creating an Account

   The Customer must create an account in order to have a username and
   password. These are personal and should not be shared, as they give
   access to the Customer’s personal information and order history.

   3.2 – How to Order

   The Customer places his/her order exclusively through the Website.

   After creating an account, the Customer can access the different
   private sales offered by the site and select one to view﻿.

   The Customer can click on a Product for a detailed description of its
   features﻿ (its composition, sizes offered, colours, price incl. tax,
   etc.).

   The Customer can select the size and quantity using the drop-down
   menus.

   To confirm a selection, the Customer must click “Add to Basket”.

   The Customer can then continue shopping by returning to the shop and
   repeating the previous steps or click “See Basket” to check out.

   In this case, the Customer can preview the order under “Summary”, add a
   discount code, edit the selection if it’s not right and see the order
   total including VAT.

   Once happy with the order, the Customer can click on “NEXT” to go to
   the second step, “Address”.

   In this step, the Customer selects the shipping and billing addresses.

   Once the addresses have been selected, the Customer clicks “NEXT” to go
   to the third step, “Shipping Costs”.

   This step shows the present General Conditions of Sale. The Customer
   must check the box “I confirm I have read and accept the general
   conditions of sale﻿” to continue with the purchase.

   Also in the third step, under “Shipping Costs”, the Customer can select
   a shipping method﻿ (e.g. Colissimo, Mondial Relay and/or a specialised
   carrier depending on the size and destination of the order).

   The Customer must click “NEXT” to go to the fourth step, “Payment”.

   3.3 – Payment

   In the fourth step, “Payment”, the Customer selects their payment
   method.

   Payment for purchases can be made by credit card or using a PayPal
   account. Accepted cards: Visa, AmericanExpress, MasterCard and Maestro.

   In accordance with regulations and to guarantee the safety and
   confidentiality of Customer information, PrivateSportShop.com does not
   save bank details.

   To guarantee the safety of the payment data provided by the Customer,
   PrivateSportShop has chosen the payment Platform Braintree﻿.﻿

   This guarantees the confidentiality of personal information sent via
   the internet. This way, the Customer's bank details are not kept on the
   Website and the payment is secured by the SSL (Secure Socket Layer)
   encryption system.﻿

   However, to make the purchasing process easier for future orders, an
   option to save bank details is available﻿. The Customer can do this by
   checking the "Save this card" option on the payment page of the
   Website. The Customer’s bank details are then stored only on
   Braintree﻿’s ﻿encrypted servers.

   It is not compulsory to save the Customer's bank details when ordering
   on the Website. Furthermore, the Customer may delete saved bank details
   at any time, via the "Manage credit cards" heading under "My Account"﻿.

   In accordance with the French Data Protection and Civil Liberties Act
   of 6 January 1978, ﻿the Customer has at any moment a right of access,
   rectification, and opposition of the whole of his/her personal data by
   writing, and justifying his/her identity, to
   eusalessupportt@braintreepayments.com﻿﻿.﻿

   The Customer confirms authorisation to use the credit card or other
   payment method before paying for the order.

   In order to combat fraudulent purchases, PrivateSportShop reserves the
   right to ask for information and documents from the cardholder. If the
   Customer does not respond, PrivateSportShop reserves the right to
   cancel the order.

   To complete and submit the purchase, the Customer must click “Confirm
   this order and pay﻿”.

   The transaction is only complete once payment has been confirmed.

   PrivateSportShop will confirm in real time on its Website﻿ that the
   payment has been received and that the transaction is complete.

   An email will confirm that the order has been registered. Failure to
   respect the terms of these GCS, and particularly concerning any
   problems relating to payment of the purchase, may lead to cancellation
   of the order and suspension from services on PrivateSportShop.com.

   PrivateSportShop recommends Customers keep a digital or hard copy of
   this information.

   The data saved by PrivateSportShop is proof of nature, content and date
   of the order. This information is archived by PrivateSportShop.

   PrivateSportShop only commits to fulfil orders received through its
   Website while stocks last for the products concerned.

   3.4 – Changing an Order

   To make any changes to your order, please contact our Customer Service
   Team:

   - By phone on +44 (0) 800 808 5593 (cost of a local call), from Monday

   page.


   ﻿Article 4: Delivery and Shipping

   4.1: General

   Products purchased on PrivateSportShop are delivered to the United
   Kingdom, France, the French Overseas Departments, Andorra, Austria,
   Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Luxemburg,
   Monaco, Norway, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, ROI, Slovakia, Slovenia,
   Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.﻿

   Products are delivered to the address provided by the Customer during
   the ordering process.The order may be sent in multiple packages if it
   contains products of different brands or the dimensions of the
   product/s require it.

   The Company will email the Customer with a dispatch notice for each
   order, containing the order tracking number if provided by the carrier,
   as well as other information.

   Products purchased on the “PRIVATE SALES” section of the Website are
   generally shipped within an estimated time of 25 days after the end of
   the sale. Products purchased on the “SHOP” section are generally
   shipped within 10 working days. Shipping may take longer for orders
   outside of Metropolitan France. The delivery tracking information is
   available on the website automatically once logged into "My Account /
   Order".﻿

   Shipping times correspond to the time needed for processing the order
   in addition to the delivery time﻿.

   Delivery consists of transfer into the Customer’s physical possession
   or inspection of the product.


   4.2 – Shipping Methods

   Deliveries are mainly carried out via the services offered by La Poste
   or another carrier service, depending on the size of the products and
   the chosen destination. This information will be visible during the
   ordering process.

   The carrier will deliver the package to the recipient’s address without
   being required to deliver to the door (e.g. upstairs apartment).

   When stated by PrivateSportShop that a product may be delivered to a
   specific room chosen by the customer, the latter must first make sure
   that the package dimensions do not exceed the building/room entry
   dimensions.  If delivery requires the use of a freight elevator or any
   other specific equipment, the additional costs shall be incurred solely
   by the customer.

   Considering the value of the merchandise and its sensitive nature, it
   is the Customer’s responsibility to check the item(s) in the carrier’s
   presence.

   What to Do:

   ﻿- Upon receipt, the Customer should open the package and check the
   merchandise ﻿in the presence of the delivery driver before signing the
   delivery slip;

   - If the products are damaged, the Customer may refuse the package and
   note the details on ﻿the delivery slip;

   - If the delivery driver refuses to stay and witness unpacking of the
   order, write on the slip, “Contents may be damaged”.

   - The customer must write a registered letter to the carrier within
   three days﻿ from the date of delivery to confirm any reservations they
   have concerning the delivery.


   ATTENTION: If the Customer accepts the package without checking the
   contents, it will be considered undamaged and no further action will be
   possible.

   4.3 –Order Tracking

   Customers can track their order on the Website, by going to “My
   Account/Orders”.

   4.4 – Late Delivery

   In the event of late delivery, the Customer may contact our customer
   service team via the PrivateSportShop website, sending an email through
   the contact form, or by phone Monday to Friday, from 9 am to 5 pm GMT﻿.
   In the absence of delivery within the prescribed timeframe, the
   Customer may require the company PrivateSportShop to make the delivery
   within a new reasonable timeframe, this being requested by registered
   letter with acknowledgment of receipt or in writing in a durable
   medium﻿.

   If the company PrivateSportShop has not complied within the time
   limit, the Customer may dissolve the contract by registered ﻿letter
   with acknowledgment of receipt, by email or standard letter (article L.
   216-2 of the French Consumer Code).

   The contract is considered dissolved on the date the letter is received
   informing PrivateSportShop of the cancellation unless it has been
   carried out already.

   The Customer’s payment will be refunded within fourteen days from the
   contract’s termination.

   If an investigation into the carrier must be carried out﻿, (abnormal
   delivery time, undelivered parcel, etc.), the customer must inform
   PrivateSportShop as soon as possible and at the latest three (3) months
   from the expected delivery date of the package. No claims shall be
   considered after this period﻿.

   No reimbursement can be made while an investigation into the carrier is
   in progress﻿. The length of an investigation may vary from 15 to 90
   days depending on the destination and the selected delivery method﻿﻿﻿

   4.5 – Transfer of Risk

   In principle, delivery is carried out by a carrier selected by
   PrivateSportShop to the shipping address entered by the Customer﻿. In
   this case, all risk of loss or damage to the Products is transferred to
   the Customer at the moment where the latter or a designated third party
   (other than the carrier chosen by PrivateSportShop) takes physical
   possession of these Products.


   ﻿Article 5: Returns

   5.1 – Right of Cancellation

   The Customer has 14 days after receiving the product to inform
   PrivateSportShop of his decision to cancel.

   The cancellation period is applicable when the Customer has received
   his order and does not wish to keep one, several, or all of the
   products within 14 days after delivery. The Customer is not required to
   provide a reason for cancelling.﻿﻿

   The Customer has an additional 14 days to return the Product(s), unless
   PrivateSportShop offers to collect the merchandise personally﻿.

   Receipt of a product is defined as the point when the Customer or a
   third party receives the package at the place indicated during the
   ordering process﻿: at home, a post office or a company. At the end of
   the timeframe indicated above, this right of cancellation becomes void.


   Returns﻿

   For all returns in accordance with the right of cancellation,
   PrivateSportShop asks the Customer to use the “Contact Us” section of
   the Website to indicate his desire to cancel, selecting “Return a
   product” as the subject and entering the order number and the products
   to be returned.

   The Customer must return the product(s) to PrivateSportShop at his own
   cost. PrivateSportShop does not cover the cost of the return for a
   cancellation.﻿

   PrivateSportShop suggests the Customer use a recorded delivery service.
   In the case of a dispute, proof of sending will be requested.

   The Customer should also fill out the cancellation form, annexed below
   and send it to the following address:info@privatesportshop.com

   If, due the product’s nature, it cannot be sent by normal post,
   PrivateSportShop will inform the consumer of the return costs on a case
   by case basis, upon request﻿.

   It is understood that the products will be returned intact, clean and
   whole (that is in perfect condition for resale, not modified or
   assembled against the manufacturer’s recommendations or taken apart),
   accompanied by any instructions and accessories (batteries, chargers,
   cords, etc.) as well as a legible copy of the invoice. Once the product
   has been used, dismantled, modified, assembled or personalised, the
   right of cancellation will be rendered null and void.

   Where applicable, PrivateSportShop will refund the payments received,
   including shipping costs, no later than fourteen days from receipt of
   the cancellation request.

   Unless offering to collect the products personally, PrivateSportShop
   may defer the refund until the goods have been received or until the
   Customer provides valid proof of sending, the first of these being
   considered the start date for the refund period.

   Refunds will be made using the same payment method as used by the
   Customer for the original transaction.

   PrivateSportShop will not be required to refund additional charges if
   the Customer expressly chose a more expensive delivery method than the
   standard delivery option.

   Exceptions

   In accordance with article L. 221-28 of the French Consumer Code, right
   of cancellation cannot be applied to the following products:

   - Products customised at the Customer’s request, including: assembly
   and fitting of bindings, etc﻿.

   - Products that are likely to perish quickly

   - Audio or video recordings or computer software that has been
   unpackaged by the consumer (that is if the blister pack has been
   opened, removed or torn for CDs and DVDs for example)﻿.

   - Newspapers, periodicals and magazines

   - Digital content not provided on a physical medium that has been
   launched with the Customer's permission﻿

   - Goods unpackaged by the Customer after delivery that cannot be
   returned for health or hygiene reasons

   - Goods that have been combined with other articles after delivery and
   cannot be separated﻿.

   5.2 – Guarantees

   The customer is informed that the company PRIVATE SPORT SHOP, located
   at 460 Avenue des Bigos 34740 Vendargues FRANCE, is responsible for any
   defects in the item sold.﻿

   When acting on the legal guarantee of conformity and as stated below,
   the Customer:

   - has a period of 2 years to act, from delivery of the product﻿;﻿

   - may choose between the replacement or repair of the goods﻿, subject
   to conditions set out in article L.217-9 of the French Consumer Code;

   - is exempt from providing proof of the item's non conformity during
   the six months following delivery of the goods. This period is extended
   to 24 months from March 18 2016, exluding second-hand goods.﻿


   The legal guarantee of conformity applies irrespective of any
   commercial warranty that the manufacturer may grant.

   The consumer may also enforce the guarantee against hidden defects of
   the item sold in the sense of article 1641 of the French Civil Code,
   and in this case, the Customer may choose between the cancellation﻿ of
   the sale or a reduction of the sale price﻿ (according to article ﻿1644
   of the French Civil Code).﻿﻿


   Legal Guarantee of Conformity

   In compliance with Articles L. 217-4 and following of the French
   Consumer Code, the Customer has a legal guarantee of conformity for the
   product ordered, limited to two years after the product’s delivery,
   which allows him to claim the repair or replacement of the
   non-compliant items, without additional cost﻿.

   To comply with the contract, the product must:

   -        (i) fit the purpose for which goods of the same type are
   normally used and, where applicable, match the description given by
   PrivateSportShop and possess the qualities of the goods which were
   shown to the Customer by way of sample or model; and possess the
   qualities that a Customer may legitimately expect from
   PrivateSportShop's publicity on its Website, namely through advertising
   or labelling﻿;

   For example, a product considered non-compliant:

   o    does not match the technical specifications or visual
   characteristics shown on the product page at the time of buying,

   o    upon reception is stained, damaged, used, not in working condition
   or does not match the size or model chosen by the Customer.

   -    (ii) have the characteristics defined by joint agreement of the
   parties or be fit for any particular purpose desired by the Customer,
   which was made known to PrivateSportShop and agreed by the latter.

   Any lack of conformity which becomes apparent within 2 years of
   delivery of the goods shall be presumed to have existed at the time of
   delivery, unless proven otherwise﻿.

   The Customer may not, however, claim non-conformity if he knew of or
   could not ignore the defect at the time of purchase﻿ or if the defect
   is minor.

   In the case of a lack of conformity﻿, the Customer may opt to have the
   item repaired or replaced.

   However, PrivateSportShop may refuse if the Customer’s choice entails
   disproportionate costs in comparison with the alternative solution,
   taking into account the value of the goods or the significance of the
   defect. The Company will then proceed with the option not chosen by the
   Customer, unless this proves impossible﻿.

   If such a solution cannot be implemented within a month following the
   Customer’s claim, or cannot be implemented without significant
   inconvenience to the latter given the item’s nature and intended
   purpose, the Customer may:

   -        return the item and ask for a refund

   -        keep the item and ask for a price reduction in the form of a
   voucher to be used on the Website﻿.

   If repair and replacement are impossible, the Customer may also return
   the item and ask for a refund or keep the item and ask for a partial
   refund﻿.

   This guarantee shall be applied at no cost to the Customer and shall
   not prevent compensation for damages.


   Latent Defects

   Additionally, in compliance with Articles 1641 and following of the
   French Civil Code, the Customer has a legal warranty against latent
   defects, which must be claimed within two years from discovery of the
   defect and which allows him to receive a total or partial refund for
   the goods found unfit for the intended use.

   A latent defect is a defect that renders the product unfit for its
   intended use or so impairs its usage that the Customer would not have
   bought it, or would have paid less for it had he ﻿been aware﻿.

   The Customer may therefore choose between﻿:

   -         returning the item and asking for a refund,

   -         keeping the item and asking for a partial refund (this price
   will be deterrmined by ﻿an expert).

   If PrivateSportShop was aware of the item’s defect, it may be liable
   for compensation, further to a refund (or partial refund)﻿.

   However, if PrivateSportShop was unaware of the item’s defect, it will
   only be liable for a refund and must also reimburse the Customer for
   any costs incurred ﻿by the sale.

   PrivateSportShop is not liable for obvious defects of which the
   Customer would have been aware﻿.

   Returns

   In the event of a product's non-conformity, it may be returned by the
   Client to the Company, according to the following process﻿:

   > Signal a return request:

   - By email: on the “Contact Us” page of the Website, select the subject
   “Defective product - Wrong item received”, enter your email address and
   the items to be returned as well as the reason for return. Or send your
   request to info@PrivateSportShop.com and enter your Order Number.

   - By phone: +44 (0) 800 808 5593 (cost of a local call), from Monday to
   Friday 9 am to 5 pm GMT﻿

   > Return Shipping Costs and Delivery Method:

   In the event of non-conformity﻿, shipping costs for the return and
   possible reshipment of the merchandise will be covered by
   PrivateSportShop.com.

   Depending on the size of the merchandise, a prepaid return label will
   will be sent to the customer by email, with the address for the
   PrivateSportShop returns service and the customer return address﻿, or a
   pick-up will be arranged with a specialised carrier.﻿

   > Prepare the package:

   To return the merchandise, use standard packaging or the original box
   used for delivery﻿. The returned product(s) must be whole (including
   instructions, accessories, with its tag, etc.)﻿ and in its original
   packaging. To return via Colissimo, stick the return label onto your
   package and take it to the post office.

   In the event of pick-up by the carrier, make sure the item is packed
   correctly﻿. The Carrier Company will contact the Customer to organise
   pick-up details, which will usually entail a half-day time slot, Monday
   to Friday between 8 am and 6 pm﻿.

   > PrivateSportShop Confirmation:

   Upon reception of the merchandise, PrivateSportShop will check its
   condition. Returns will not be accepted if the returned items have been
   visibly worn or damaged by the Customer and this prevents the product’s
   resale﻿. If the return request is refused by PrivateSportShop, the
   products will be returned to the Customer at the Company’s expense so
   the Customer does not require compensation or a refund﻿.

   In this case, PrivateSportShop will contact the Customer to offer:

   - sending an identical replacement product, if stocks are available,

   - a refund for the product. This will be refunded within 15 days after
   receipt of the item by PrivateSportShop.


   5.3 – Request for After Sales Support:

   Any product guarantees are ﻿displayed on the Product pages of the
   Website during the purchase process﻿﻿. These are guarantees granted by
   the suppliers and are effective from the date of purchase﻿. The Company
   cannot take responsibility for the guarantees granted by suppliers﻿.
   The returns process, support and refunds are identical to those
   outlined in article 5-2 Guarantees﻿.


   5.4 – Refunds

   All refunds will be made within a maximum of 14 days from confirmation
   by PrivateSportShop. Return of a whole order will be completely
   refunded, including shipping costs.﻿ Partial return of an order will be
   refunded for the related items only, excluding shipping costs, which
   are a fixed charge﻿. Shipping costs may be refunded if the total for
   the remaining articles is less than the shipping costs paid.

   In the event of a full or partial return of an order where a voucher
   has been used, the discounted amount will not be not refunded﻿.﻿

   Unless offering to collect the products personally, PrivateSportShop
   may defer the refund until the goods have been received or until the
   Customer provides valid proof of sending, the first of these being
   considered the start date for the refund period.﻿

   PrivateSportShop will use the same method of payment for the refund as
   that used by the Customer for the original purchase: monetary, voucher
   or both﻿.
   ﻿

   ﻿Article 6: Referral, Vouchers and Loyalty Credits

   6.1 - Referral

   All Customers can invite any friends they choose.

   The contact details of the original member must be filled in at the
   time of the New Customer's registration on the site, modification or
   additions cannot be made afterwards﻿.﻿

   The Company reserves the right to limit excessive and automatic
   invitations of purely commercial or financial ends, owing to the
   advantages earned by the Customer through the referral scheme. The
   Company reserves the right to refuse any invitation that does not
   comply with the spirit of this article and, as a result, the right to
   cancel the advantages received as well as other related reductions﻿.

   How referral works on the PrivateSportShop Website:

   - All Customers (registered members) can invite friends to sign up on
   PrivateSportShop.com

   - When the invitation is accepted and the friend signs up on
   PrivateSportShop.com and mentions the name of the person who invited
   them, they become the “Friend” of that Customer (member).

   - The original member will be credited with a voucher worth 10€ once
   the Friend ﻿has placed his/her first order, following the withdrawal
   period of 14 days after delivery. It is therefore understood that each
   Friend may earn a maximum of 10€ for the original member.

   - Under the heading “Loyalty Scheme” in the “My Credits” menu, the
   Customer can see the status of his/her invitations﻿.

   Vouchers are valid for 1 year following the date they are earned﻿. They
   can be used throughout the Website, excluding travel, tickets, coupons
   and services.

   6.2 - Vouchers:

   Vouchers (promotional codes) are valid for single use only. They are
   visible under the heading “Vouchers” in “My Account”. Vouchers sent by
