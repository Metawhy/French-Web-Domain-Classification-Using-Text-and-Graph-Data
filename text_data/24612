Screen compatibility overview

   Android runs on a variety of devices that have different screen sizes
   and pixel densities. The system performs basic scaling and resizing to
   adapt your user interface to different screens, but there is more work
   you should do to ensure your UI gracefully adapts for each type of
   screen.

   This page provides an overview of these topics and the features
   available on Android to help your app adapt accordingly. For more
   specific instructions about how to build your app for these screen
   variations, see the following pages:
     * Support Different Screen Sizes
     * Support Different Pixel Densities

Screen sizes

   The screen size is the visible space provided for your app UI. The
   screen size as it's known to your app is not the actual size of the
   device screen—it takes into account the screen orientation, system
   decorations (such as the navigation bar), and window configuration
   changes (such as when the user enables multi-window mode).

Flexible layouts

   By default, Android resizes your app layout to fit the current screen.
   To ensure your layout resizes well for even small variations in screen
   size, you need to implement your layout with flexibility in mind. The
   core principle you must follow is to avoid hard-coding the position and
   size of your UI components. Instead, allow view sizes to stretch and
   specify view positions relative to the parent view or other sibling
   views so your intended order and relative sizes remain the same as the
   layout grows.

   Learn more about flexible layouts.

Alternative layouts

   A flexible layout is very important, but you should also design
   different layouts that optimize the user experience for the available
   space on different devices such as phones and tablets. So Android
   allows you to provide alternative layout files that the system applies
   at runtime based on the current device's screen size.

   Figure 1. The same app uses a different layout for different screen
   sizes

   Learn how to create alternative layouts.

Stretchable images

   Because your layout should stretch to fit the current screen, so too
   should the bitmaps that you attach to any of the layout views. However,
   stretching an ordinary bitmap in arbitrary directions can result in
   strange scaling artifacts and skewed images.

   To solve this, Android supports nine-patch bitmaps in which you specify
   small pixel regions that are stretchable—the rest of the image remain
   unscaled.

   Learn more about nine-patch bitmaps.

Pixel densities

   The pixel density is the number of pixels within a physical area of the
   screen and is referred to as dpi (dots per inch). This is different
   from the resolution, which is the total number of pixels on a screen.

   Figure 2. An exaggeration of two device that are the same size but have
   different pixel densities

Density independence

   Your app achieves "density independence" when it preserves the physical
   size (from the user's point of view) of your UI design when displayed
   on screens with different pixel densities (as shown in figure 2).
   Maintaining density independence is important because, without it, a UI
   element (such as a button) might appear larger on a low-density screen
   and smaller on a high-density screen (because when the pixels are
   larger—as shown in figure 2—a few pixels can go a long way).

   The Android system helps you achieve density independence by providing
   density-independent pixels (dp or dip) as a unit of measurement that
   you should use instead of pixels (px).

   Learn more about density independent pixels.

Alternative bitmaps

   To ensure your images appear at their best on all screens, you should
   provide alternative bitmaps to match each screen density. For example,
   if your app provides bitmaps only for medium density (mdpi) screens,
   Android scales them up when on a high-density screen so that the image
   occupies the same physical space on the screen. This can cause visible
   scaling artifacts in bitmaps. So your app should include alternative
   bitmaps at a higher resolution.

   Learn how to provide alternative bitmaps.

Vector graphics

   For simple types of images (usually icons), you can avoid creating
   separate images for each density by using vector graphics. Because
   vector graphics define the illustration with geometric line paths
   instead of pixels, they can be drawn at any size without scaling
   artifacts.

   Learn more about using vector graphics.

Wear OS, TV, Auto, and Chrome OS

   The recommendations above apply to all Android form factors, but if you
   want to build an app for Wear OS, Android TV, Android Auto, or Chrome
   OS devices, you need to do a bit more work.

   Each of these devices have their own user interaction model that your
   app should accommodate. In some cases, such as for Wear OS, you should
   re-think your app's user experience and build an app that's specialized
   for that device. And to support Chrome OS devices (such as the Google
   Pixelbook), you might need only slight modifications to your existing
   app to support keyboard/mouse interaction and a much larger screen.

   To support these devices, refer to the following developer guides:
     * Building Apps for Wear OS
     * Building Apps for Android TV
     * Building Apps for Android Auto
     * Building Apps for Chrome OS

Screen incompatibility

   Although the Android framework and tools provide everything you need to
   make an app available to all screen configurations, you still might
   decide you don't want your app available on some screen configurations
   due to some sort of incompatibility.

   In that case, you can declare your app supports only specific screens.

Terms and Conditions

   This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

1. Introduction

   1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License
   Agreement as the "SDK" and specifically including the Android system
   files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons) is licensed to you
   subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
   forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to
   your use of the SDK. 1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for
   devices, as made available under the Android Open Source Project, which
   is located at the following URL: http://source.android.com/, as updated
   from time to time. 1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android
   device that (i) complies with the Android Compatibility Definition
   document, which can be found at the Android compatibility website
   (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from
   time to time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility
   Test Suite (CTS). 1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation
   with principal place of business at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain
   View, CA 94043, United States.

2. Accepting this License Agreement

   2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License
   Agreement. You may not use the SDK if you do not accept the License
   Agreement. 2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of
   the License Agreement. 2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept
   the License Agreement if you are a person barred from receiving the SDK
   under the laws of the United States or other countries, including the
   country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK. 2.4 If
   you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your
   employer or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full
   legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to the License
   Agreement. If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not
   accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your employer
   or other entity.

3. SDK License from Google

   3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a
   limited, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and
   non-sublicensable license to use the SDK solely to develop applications
   for compatible implementations of Android. 3.2 You may not use this SDK
   to develop applications for other platforms (including non-compatible
   implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of
   course free to develop applications for other platforms, including
   non-compatible implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is
   not used for that purpose. 3.3 You agree that Google or third parties
   own all legal right, title and interest in and to the SDK, including
   any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
   Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright
   law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary
   rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you. 3.4
   You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the
   License Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third
   party licenses, you may not copy (except for backup purposes), modify,
   adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or
   create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK. 3.5 Use,
   reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under
   an open source software license are governed solely by the terms of
   that open source software license and not the License Agreement. 3.6
   You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may
   change without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK
   may be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of
   the SDK. You agree that Google may stop (permanently or temporarily)
   providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to users
   generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. 3.7
   Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of
   Google's trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names,
   or other distinctive brand features. 3.8 You agree that you will not
   remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including
   copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained
   within the SDK.

4. Use of the SDK by You

   4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you
   (or your licensors) under the License Agreement in or to any software
   applications that you develop using the SDK, including any intellectual
   property rights that subsist in those applications. 4.2 You agree to
   use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted
   by (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or
   generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
   jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or
   software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
   4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for
   general public users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of
   those users. If the users provide you with user names, passwords, or
   other login information or personal information, you must make the
   users aware that the information will be available to your application,
   and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for
   those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive
   information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
   provides your application with Google Account information, your
   application may only use that information to access the user's Google
   Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has
   given you permission to do so. 4.4 You agree that you will not engage
   in any activity with the SDK, including the development or distribution
   of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses
   in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or
   services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or
   any mobile communications carrier. 4.5 You agree that you are solely
   responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any
   third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create,
   transmit or display through Android and/or applications for Android,
   and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage
   which Google may suffer) by doing so. 4.6 You agree that you are solely
   responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any
   third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License
   Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or
   any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including
   any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any
   such breach.

5. Your Developer Credentials

   5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the
   confidentiality of any developer credentials that may be issued to you
   by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you will be solely
   responsible for all applications that are developed under your
   developer credentials.

6. Privacy and Information

   6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may
   collect certain usage statistics from the software including but not
   limited to a unique identifier, associated IP address, version number
   of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in the
   SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this
   information is collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your
   consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be
   collected. 6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to
   improve the SDK and is maintained in accordance with Google's Privacy
   Policy.

7. Third Party Applications

   7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party
   or that access data, content or resources provided by a third party,
   you agree that Google is not responsible for those applications, data,
   content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
   resources which you may access through such third party applications
   are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated
   and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may
   experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third party
   applications, data, content, or resources. 7.2 You should be aware the
   data, content, and resources presented to you through such a third
   party application may be protected by intellectual property rights
   which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on
   their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute
   or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources
   (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given
   permission to do so by the relevant owners. 7.3 You acknowledge that
   your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources
   may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third
   party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal
   relationship with these third parties.

8. Using Android APIs

   8.1 Google Data APIs 8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from
   Google, you acknowledge that the data may be protected by intellectual
   property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that provide
   the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use
   of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may
   not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative
   works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by
   the relevant Terms of Service. 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a
   user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that you shall
   retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and
   for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission
   to do so. If you use the Android Recognition Service API, documented at
   the following URL:
   https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionServi
   ce, as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the
   API is subject to the Data Processing Addendum for Products where
   Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the following URL:
   https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/, as updated
   from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms
   of the Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data
   Processor.

9. Terminating this License Agreement

   9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by
   either you or Google as set out below. 9.2 If you want to terminate the
   License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the SDK and any
   relevant developer credentials. 9.3 Google may at any time, terminate
   the License Agreement with you if: (A) you have breached any provision
   of the License Agreement; or (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
   (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as
   APIs) to you has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to
   offer certain parts of the SDK to you; or (D) Google decides to no
   longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
   country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or
   the provision of the SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is,
   in Google's sole discretion, no longer commercially viable. 9.4 When
   the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights,
   obligations and liabilities that you and Google have benefited from,
   been subject to (or which have accrued over time whilst the License
   Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
   indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions
   of paragraph 14.7 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations
   and liabilities indefinitely.

10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES

   10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT
   YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE"
   WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM GOOGLE. 10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND
   ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE
   SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE
   FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA
   THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE. 10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL
   WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
   INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
   MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

   11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES
   AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY
   THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
   CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU,
   INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS
   REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.

12. Indemnification

   12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend,
   indemnify and hold harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective
   directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all
   claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any and all losses,
   liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable
   attorneys fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the
   SDK, (b) any application you develop on the SDK that infringes any
   copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent or other
   intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or
   violates their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any
   non-compliance by you with the License Agreement.

13. Changes to the License Agreement

   13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes
   new versions of the SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make
   a new version of the License Agreement available on the website where
   the SDK is made available.

14. General Legal Terms

   14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement
   between you and Google and governs your use of the SDK (excluding any
   services which Google may provide to you under a separate written
   agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you
   and Google in relation to the SDK. 14.2 You agree that if Google does
   not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in
   the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
   applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of
   Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be
   available to Google. 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction
   to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of the License
   Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
   License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement.
   The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be
   valid and enforceable. 14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member
   of the group of companies of which Google is the parent shall be third
   party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
   companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any
   provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights
   in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be
   third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement. 14.5 EXPORT
   RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND
   REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT
   LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE
   RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE. 14.6 The rights
   granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
   either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other
   party. Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their
   responsibilities or obligations under the License Agreement without the
   prior written approval of the other party. 14.7 The License Agreement,
   and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be
   governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its
   conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the
   exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa
   Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the License
   Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
   allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of
   urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction. January 16, 2019

   14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement

   and Google in relation to the SDK. 14.2 You agree that if Google does
   not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in
   the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
   applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of
   Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be
   available to Google. 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction
   to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of the License
   Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
   License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement.
   The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be
   valid and enforceable. 14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member
   of the group of companies of which Google is the parent shall be third
   party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
   companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any
   provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights
   in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be
   third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement. 14.5 EXPORT
   RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND
   REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT

   granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
   either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other
   party. Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their
   responsibilities or obligations under the License Agreement without the
   prior written approval of the other party. 14.7 The License Agreement,
   and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be
   governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its
   conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the
   exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa
   Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the License
   Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
   allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of
   urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction. January 16, 2019

   limited, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and
   non-sublicensable license to use the SDK solely to develop applications
   for compatible implementations of Android. 3.2 You may not use this SDK

   applications that you develop using the SDK, including any intellectual
   property rights that subsist in those applications. 4.2 You agree to

   software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
   4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for
   general public users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of

   users aware that the information will be available to your application,
   and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for
   those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive
   information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
   provides your application with Google Account information, your
   application may only use that information to access the user's Google
   Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has
   given you permission to do so. 4.4 You agree that you will not engage
   in any activity with the SDK, including the development or distribution

   any mobile communications carrier. 4.5 You agree that you are solely
   responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any

   which Google may suffer) by doing so. 4.6 You agree that you are solely
   responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any
   third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License
   Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or
   any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including
   any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any
   such breach.

5. Your Developer Credentials

   5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the
   confidentiality of any developer credentials that may be issued to you
   by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you will be solely
   responsible for all applications that are developed under your
   developer credentials.

6. Privacy and Information

   6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may
   collect certain usage statistics from the software including but not
   limited to a unique identifier, associated IP address, version number
   of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in the
   SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this
   information is collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your
   consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be
   collected. 6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to

   or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources
   (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given
   permission to do so by the relevant owners. 7.3 You acknowledge that
   your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources
   may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third
   party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal
   relationship with these third parties.

8. Using Android APIs

   8.1 Google Data APIs 8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from

   of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may
   not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative
   works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by
   the relevant Terms of Service. 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a
   user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that you shall
   retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and

   applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of
   Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be
   available to Google. 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction
   to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of the License
   Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
   License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement.
   The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be
   valid and enforceable. 14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member
   of the group of companies of which Google is the parent shall be third
   party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
   companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any
   provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights
   in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be
   third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement. 14.5 EXPORT

   party. Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their
   responsibilities or obligations under the License Agreement without the
   prior written approval of the other party. 14.7 The License Agreement,
   and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be
   governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its
   conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the
   exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa
   Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the License
   Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
   allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of
   urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction. January 16, 2019

   permission to do so by the relevant owners. 7.3 You acknowledge that
   your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources
   may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third

   create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK. 3.5 Use,
   reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under
   an open source software license are governed solely by the terms of
   that open source software license and not the License Agreement. 3.6
   You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may
   change without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK
   may be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of

4. Use of the SDK by You

   4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you
   (or your licensors) under the License Agreement in or to any software
   applications that you develop using the SDK, including any intellectual
   property rights that subsist in those applications. 4.2 You agree to
   use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted
   by (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or

   other login information or personal information, you must make the
   users aware that the information will be available to your application,
   and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for
   those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive
   information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
   provides your application with Google Account information, your
   application may only use that information to access the user's Google
   Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has
   given you permission to do so. 4.4 You agree that you will not engage
   in any activity with the SDK, including the development or distribution
   of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses
   in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or
   services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or
   any mobile communications carrier. 4.5 You agree that you are solely
   responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any
   third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create,

   which Google may suffer) by doing so. 4.6 You agree that you are solely
   responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any
   third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License
   Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or
   any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including
   any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any
   such breach.

5. Your Developer Credentials

   5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the
   confidentiality of any developer credentials that may be issued to you
   by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you will be solely
   responsible for all applications that are developed under your
   developer credentials.

6. Privacy and Information

   6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may
   collect certain usage statistics from the software including but not
   limited to a unique identifier, associated IP address, version number
   of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in the
   SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this
   information is collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your
   consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be
   collected. 6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to
   improve the SDK and is maintained in accordance with Google's Privacy
   Policy.

   you agree that Google is not responsible for those applications, data,
   content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
   resources which you may access through such third party applications
   are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated
   and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may
   experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third party
   applications, data, content, or resources. 7.2 You should be aware the
   data, content, and resources presented to you through such a third
   party application may be protected by intellectual property rights
   which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on
   their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute
   or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources
   (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given
   permission to do so by the relevant owners. 7.3 You acknowledge that
   your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources
   may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third
   party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal
   relationship with these third parties.

8. Using Android APIs

   8.1 Google Data APIs 8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from
   Google, you acknowledge that the data may be protected by intellectual
   property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that provide
   the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use
   of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may
   not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative
   works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by
   the relevant Terms of Service. 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a
   user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that you shall
   retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and

   APIs) to you has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to
   offer certain parts of the SDK to you; or (D) Google decides to no
   longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
   country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or
   the provision of the SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is,
   in Google's sole discretion, no longer commercially viable. 9.4 When
   the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights,
   obligations and liabilities that you and Google have benefited from,
   been subject to (or which have accrued over time whilst the License
   Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
   indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions
   of paragraph 14.7 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations
   and liabilities indefinitely.

   AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY
   THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
   CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU,
   INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS
   REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE

   and Google in relation to the SDK. 14.2 You agree that if Google does
   not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in
   the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
   applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of
   Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be
   available to Google. 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction
   to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of the License
   Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
   License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement.
   The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be
   valid and enforceable. 14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member
   of the group of companies of which Google is the parent shall be third
   party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
   companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any
   provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights
   in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be
   third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement. 14.5 EXPORT
   RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND

   granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
   either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other
   party. Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their
   responsibilities or obligations under the License Agreement without the
   prior written approval of the other party. 14.7 The License Agreement,
   and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be
   governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its
   conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the
   exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa
   Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the License
   Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
   allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of
   urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction. January 16, 2019

   course free to develop applications for other platforms, including
   non-compatible implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is
   not used for that purpose. 3.3 You agree that Google or third parties
   own all legal right, title and interest in and to the SDK, including
   any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
   Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright

   change without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK
   may be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of
   the SDK. You agree that Google may stop (permanently or temporarily)
   providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to users
   generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. 3.7

   applications that you develop using the SDK, including any intellectual
   property rights that subsist in those applications. 4.2 You agree to
   use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted
   by (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or
   generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
   jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or
   software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
   4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for
   general public users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of
   those users. If the users provide you with user names, passwords, or
   other login information or personal information, you must make the
   users aware that the information will be available to your application,
   and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for
   those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive
   information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
   provides your application with Google Account information, your
   application may only use that information to access the user's Google
   Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has
   given you permission to do so. 4.4 You agree that you will not engage
   in any activity with the SDK, including the development or distribution
   of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses

   services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or
   any mobile communications carrier. 4.5 You agree that you are solely
   responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any
   third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create,

   which Google may suffer) by doing so. 4.6 You agree that you are solely
   responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any
   third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License
   Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or
   any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including
   any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any
   such breach.

5. Your Developer Credentials

   5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the
   confidentiality of any developer credentials that may be issued to you
   by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you will be solely
   responsible for all applications that are developed under your
   developer credentials.

6. Privacy and Information

   6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may
   collect certain usage statistics from the software including but not
   limited to a unique identifier, associated IP address, version number
   of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in the
   SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this
   information is collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your
   consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be
   collected. 6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to
   improve the SDK and is maintained in accordance with Google's Privacy
   Policy.

   and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may
   experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third party
   applications, data, content, or resources. 7.2 You should be aware the
   data, content, and resources presented to you through such a third
   party application may be protected by intellectual property rights
   which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on

   or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources
   (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given
   permission to do so by the relevant owners. 7.3 You acknowledge that
   your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources
   may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third
   party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal
   relationship with these third parties.

8. Using Android APIs

   8.1 Google Data APIs 8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from
   Google, you acknowledge that the data may be protected by intellectual
   property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that provide
   the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use
   of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may
   not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative
   works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by
   the relevant Terms of Service. 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a
   user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that you shall
   retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and
   for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission

   9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by
   either you or Google as set out below. 9.2 If you want to terminate the
   License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the SDK and any
   relevant developer credentials. 9.3 Google may at any time, terminate
   the License Agreement with you if: (A) you have breached any provision
   of the License Agreement; or (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
   (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as
   APIs) to you has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to
   offer certain parts of the SDK to you; or (D) Google decides to no
   longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
   country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or
   the provision of the SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is,
   in Google's sole discretion, no longer commercially viable. 9.4 When
   the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights,
   obligations and liabilities that you and Google have benefited from,
   been subject to (or which have accrued over time whilst the License
   Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
   indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions
   of paragraph 14.7 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations
   and liabilities indefinitely.

   11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES
   AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY
   THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
   CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU,
   INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS
   REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.

   and Google in relation to the SDK. 14.2 You agree that if Google does
   not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in
   the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
   applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of
   Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be
   available to Google. 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction
   to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of the License
   Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
   License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement.
   The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be
   valid and enforceable. 14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member
   of the group of companies of which Google is the parent shall be third
   party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
   companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any
   provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights
   in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be
   third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement. 14.5 EXPORT
   RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND
   REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT
   LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE
   RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE. 14.6 The rights
   granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
   either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other
   party. Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their
   responsibilities or obligations under the License Agreement without the
   prior written approval of the other party. 14.7 The License Agreement,
   and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be
   governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its
   conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the
   exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa
   Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the License
   Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
   allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of
   urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction. January 16, 2019

   not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in
   the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
   applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of
   Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be
   available to Google. 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction
   to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of the License
   Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
   License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement.
   The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be
   valid and enforceable. 14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member
   of the group of companies of which Google is the parent shall be third
   party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
   companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any
   provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights
   in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be
   third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement. 14.5 EXPORT
   RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND
   REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT

   RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE. 14.6 The rights
   granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
   either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other
   party. Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their
   responsibilities or obligations under the License Agreement without the
   prior written approval of the other party. 14.7 The License Agreement,
   and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be
   governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its
   conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the
   exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa
   Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the License
   Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
   allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of
   urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction. January 16, 2019

   software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
   4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for
   general public users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of
   those users. If the users provide you with user names, passwords, or
   other login information or personal information, you must make the
   users aware that the information will be available to your application,
   and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for
   those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive
   information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
   provides your application with Google Account information, your
   application may only use that information to access the user's Google
   Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has
   given you permission to do so. 4.4 You agree that you will not engage
   in any activity with the SDK, including the development or distribution

   any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any
   such breach.

5. Your Developer Credentials

   5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the
   confidentiality of any developer credentials that may be issued to you

   or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources
   (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given
   permission to do so by the relevant owners. 7.3 You acknowledge that
   your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources
   may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third
   party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal
   relationship with these third parties.

8. Using Android APIs

   8.1 Google Data APIs 8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from
   Google, you acknowledge that the data may be protected by intellectual
   property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that provide

   of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may
   not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative
   works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by
   the relevant Terms of Service. 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a
   user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that you shall
   retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and
   for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission

   License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the SDK and any
   relevant developer credentials. 9.3 Google may at any time, terminate
   the License Agreement with you if: (A) you have breached any provision
   of the License Agreement; or (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
   (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as
   APIs) to you has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to
   offer certain parts of the SDK to you; or (D) Google decides to no

   the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights,
   obligations and liabilities that you and Google have benefited from,
   been subject to (or which have accrued over time whilst the License
   Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
   indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions
   of paragraph 14.7 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations
   and liabilities indefinitely.

   their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute
   or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources
   (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given
   permission to do so by the relevant owners. 7.3 You acknowledge that
   your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources
   may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third
   party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal
   relationship with these third parties.

8. Using Android APIs

   8.1 Google Data APIs 8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from
   Google, you acknowledge that the data may be protected by intellectual
   property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that provide
   the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use
   of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may
   not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative
   works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by
   the relevant Terms of Service. 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a
   user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that you shall
   retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and
   for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission
   to do so. If you use the Android Recognition Service API, documented at
   the following URL:
   https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionServi
   ce, as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the
   API is subject to the Data Processing Addendum for Products where
   Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the following URL:

   from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms
   of the Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data
   Processor.

9. Terminating this License Agreement

   9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by
   either you or Google as set out below. 9.2 If you want to terminate the
   License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the SDK and any
   relevant developer credentials. 9.3 Google may at any time, terminate
   the License Agreement with you if: (A) you have breached any provision
   of the License Agreement; or (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
   (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as
   APIs) to you has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to
   offer certain parts of the SDK to you; or (D) Google decides to no
   longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
   country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or
   the provision of the SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is,
   in Google's sole discretion, no longer commercially viable. 9.4 When
   the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights,
   obligations and liabilities that you and Google have benefited from,
   been subject to (or which have accrued over time whilst the License
   Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
   indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions
   of paragraph 14.7 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations
   and liabilities indefinitely.

10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES

   10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT
   YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE"
   WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM GOOGLE. 10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND
   ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE
   SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE
   FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA
   THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE. 10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL
   WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
   INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
   MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

   11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES
   AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY
   THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
   CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU,
   INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS
   REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.

12. Indemnification

   12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend,
   indemnify and hold harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective
   directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all
   claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any and all losses,
   liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable
   attorneys fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the
   SDK, (b) any application you develop on the SDK that infringes any
   copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent or other
   intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or
   violates their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any
   non-compliance by you with the License Agreement.

13. Changes to the License Agreement

   13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes
   new versions of the SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make
   a new version of the License Agreement available on the website where
   the SDK is made available.

14. General Legal Terms

   14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement
   between you and Google and governs your use of the SDK (excluding any
   services which Google may provide to you under a separate written
   agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you
   and Google in relation to the SDK. 14.2 You agree that if Google does
   not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in
   the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
   applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of
   Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be
   available to Google. 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction
   to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of the License
   Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
   License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement.
   The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be
   valid and enforceable. 14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member
   of the group of companies of which Google is the parent shall be third
   party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
   companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any
   provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights
   in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be
   third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement. 14.5 EXPORT
   RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND
   REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT
   LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE
   RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE. 14.6 The rights
   granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
   either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other
   party. Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their
   responsibilities or obligations under the License Agreement without the
   prior written approval of the other party. 14.7 The License Agreement,
   and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be
   governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its
   conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the
   exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa
   Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the License
   Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
   allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of
   urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction. January 16, 2019

   Before downloading, you must agree to the following terms and
   conditions.

Terms and Conditions

   This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

1. Introduction

   1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License
   Agreement as the "SDK" and specifically including the Android system
   files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons) is licensed to you
   subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
   forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to
   your use of the SDK. 1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for
   devices, as made available under the Android Open Source Project, which
   is located at the following URL: http://source.android.com/, as updated
   from time to time. 1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android
   device that (i) complies with the Android Compatibility Definition
   document, which can be found at the Android compatibility website
   (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from
   time to time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility
   Test Suite (CTS). 1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation
   with principal place of business at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain
   View, CA 94043, United States.

2. Accepting this License Agreement

   2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License
   Agreement. You may not use the SDK if you do not accept the License
   Agreement. 2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of
   the License Agreement. 2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept
   the License Agreement if you are a person barred from receiving the SDK
   under the laws of the United States or other countries, including the
   country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK. 2.4 If
   you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your
   employer or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full
   legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to the License
   Agreement. If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not
   accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your employer
   or other entity.

3. SDK License from Google

   3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a
   limited, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and
   non-sublicensable license to use the SDK solely to develop applications
   for compatible implementations of Android. 3.2 You may not use this SDK
   to develop applications for other platforms (including non-compatible
   implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of
   course free to develop applications for other platforms, including
   non-compatible implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is
   not used for that purpose. 3.3 You agree that Google or third parties
   own all legal right, title and interest in and to the SDK, including
   any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
   Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright
   law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary
   rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you. 3.4
   You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the
   License Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third
   party licenses, you may not copy (except for backup purposes), modify,
   adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or
   create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK. 3.5 Use,
   reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under
   an open source software license are governed solely by the terms of
   that open source software license and not the License Agreement. 3.6
   You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may
   change without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK
   may be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of
   the SDK. You agree that Google may stop (permanently or temporarily)
   providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to users
   generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. 3.7
   Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of
   Google's trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names,
   or other distinctive brand features. 3.8 You agree that you will not
   remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including
   copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained
   within the SDK.

4. Use of the SDK by You

   4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you
   (or your licensors) under the License Agreement in or to any software
   applications that you develop using the SDK, including any intellectual
   property rights that subsist in those applications. 4.2 You agree to
   use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted
   by (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or
   generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
   jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or
   software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
   4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for
   general public users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of
   those users. If the users provide you with user names, passwords, or
   other login information or personal information, you must make the
   users aware that the information will be available to your application,
   and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for
   those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive
   information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
   provides your application with Google Account information, your
   application may only use that information to access the user's Google
   Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has
   given you permission to do so. 4.4 You agree that you will not engage
   in any activity with the SDK, including the development or distribution
   of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses
   in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or
   services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or
   any mobile communications carrier. 4.5 You agree that you are solely
   responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any
   third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create,
   transmit or display through Android and/or applications for Android,
   and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage
   which Google may suffer) by doing so. 4.6 You agree that you are solely
   responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any
   third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License
   Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or
   any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including
   any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any
   such breach.

5. Your Developer Credentials

   5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the
   confidentiality of any developer credentials that may be issued to you
   by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you will be solely
   responsible for all applications that are developed under your
   developer credentials.

6. Privacy and Information

   6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may
   collect certain usage statistics from the software including but not
   limited to a unique identifier, associated IP address, version number
   of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in the
   SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this
   information is collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your
   consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be
   collected. 6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to
   improve the SDK and is maintained in accordance with Google's Privacy
   Policy.

7. Third Party Applications

   7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party
   or that access data, content or resources provided by a third party,
   you agree that Google is not responsible for those applications, data,
   content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
   resources which you may access through such third party applications
   are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated
   and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may
   experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third party
   applications, data, content, or resources. 7.2 You should be aware the
   data, content, and resources presented to you through such a third
   party application may be protected by intellectual property rights
   which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on
   their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute
   or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources
   (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given
   permission to do so by the relevant owners. 7.3 You acknowledge that
   your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources
   may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third
   party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal
   relationship with these third parties.

8. Using Android APIs

   8.1 Google Data APIs 8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from
   Google, you acknowledge that the data may be protected by intellectual
   property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that provide
   the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use
   of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may
   not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative
   works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by
   the relevant Terms of Service. 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a
   user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that you shall
   retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and
   for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission
   to do so. If you use the Android Recognition Service API, documented at
   the following URL:
   https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionServi
   ce, as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the
   API is subject to the Data Processing Addendum for Products where
   Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the following URL:
   https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/, as updated
   from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms
   of the Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data
   Processor.

9. Terminating this License Agreement

   9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by
   either you or Google as set out below. 9.2 If you want to terminate the
   License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the SDK and any
   relevant developer credentials. 9.3 Google may at any time, terminate
   the License Agreement with you if: (A) you have breached any provision
   of the License Agreement; or (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
   (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as
   APIs) to you has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to
   offer certain parts of the SDK to you; or (D) Google decides to no
   longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
   country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or
   the provision of the SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is,
   in Google's sole discretion, no longer commercially viable. 9.4 When
   the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights,
   obligations and liabilities that you and Google have benefited from,
   been subject to (or which have accrued over time whilst the License
   Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
   indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions
   of paragraph 14.7 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations
   and liabilities indefinitely.

10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES

   10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT
   YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE"
   WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM GOOGLE. 10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND
   ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE
   SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE
   FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA
   THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE. 10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL
   WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
   INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
   MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

   11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES
   AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY
   THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
   CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU,
   INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS
   REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.

12. Indemnification

   12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend,
   indemnify and hold harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective
   directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all
   claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any and all losses,
   liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable
   attorneys fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the
   SDK, (b) any application you develop on the SDK that infringes any
   copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent or other
   intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or
   violates their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any
   non-compliance by you with the License Agreement.

13. Changes to the License Agreement

   13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes

   14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement
   between you and Google and governs your use of the SDK (excluding any
   services which Google may provide to you under a separate written
   agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you
   and Google in relation to the SDK. 14.2 You agree that if Google does
   not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in
   the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
   applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of
   Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be
   available to Google. 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction
   to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of the License
   Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
   License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement.

   valid and enforceable. 14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member
   of the group of companies of which Google is the parent shall be third
   party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
   companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any

   in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be
   third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement. 14.5 EXPORT
   RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND

   granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by

   governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its
   conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the

Screen compatibility overview

   Android runs on a variety of devices that have different screen sizes
   and pixel densities. The system performs basic scaling and resizing to
   adapt your user interface to different screens, but there is more work
   you should do to ensure your UI gracefully adapts for each type of
   screen.

   This page provides an overview of these topics and the features
   available on Android to help your app adapt accordingly. For more
   specific instructions about how to build your app for these screen
   variations, see the following pages:
     * Support Different Screen Sizes
     * Support Different Pixel Densities

Screen sizes

   The screen size is the visible space provided for your app UI. The
   screen size as it's known to your app is not the actual size of the
   device screen—it takes into account the screen orientation, system
   decorations (such as the navigation bar), and window configuration
   changes (such as when the user enables multi-window mode).

Flexible layouts

   By default, Android resizes your app layout to fit the current screen.
   To ensure your layout resizes well for even small variations in screen
   size, you need to implement your layout with flexibility in mind. The
   core principle you must follow is to avoid hard-coding the position and
   size of your UI components. Instead, allow view sizes to stretch and
   specify view positions relative to the parent view or other sibling
   views so your intended order and relative sizes remain the same as the
   layout grows.

   Learn more about flexible layouts.

Alternative layouts

   A flexible layout is very important, but you should also design
   different layouts that optimize the user experience for the available
   space on different devices such as phones and tablets. So Android
   allows you to provide alternative layout files that the system applies
   at runtime based on the current device's screen size.

   Figure 1. The same app uses a different layout for different screen
   sizes

   Learn how to create alternative layouts.

Stretchable images

   Because your layout should stretch to fit the current screen, so too
   should the bitmaps that you attach to any of the layout views. However,
   stretching an ordinary bitmap in arbitrary directions can result in
   strange scaling artifacts and skewed images.

   To solve this, Android supports nine-patch bitmaps in which you specify
   small pixel regions that are stretchable—the rest of the image remain
   unscaled.

   Learn more about nine-patch bitmaps.

Pixel densities

   The pixel density is the number of pixels within a physical area of the
   screen and is referred to as dpi (dots per inch). This is different
   from the resolution, which is the total number of pixels on a screen.

   Figure 2. An exaggeration of two device that are the same size but have
   different pixel densities

Density independence

   Your app achieves "density independence" when it preserves the physical
   size (from the user's point of view) of your UI design when displayed
   on screens with different pixel densities (as shown in figure 2).
   Maintaining density independence is important because, without it, a UI
   element (such as a button) might appear larger on a low-density screen
   and smaller on a high-density screen (because when the pixels are
   larger—as shown in figure 2—a few pixels can go a long way).

   The Android system helps you achieve density independence by providing
   density-independent pixels (dp or dip) as a unit of measurement that
   you should use instead of pixels (px).

   Learn more about density independent pixels.

Alternative bitmaps

   To ensure your images appear at their best on all screens, you should
   provide alternative bitmaps to match each screen density. For example,
   if your app provides bitmaps only for medium density (mdpi) screens,
   Android scales them up when on a high-density screen so that the image
   occupies the same physical space on the screen. This can cause visible
   scaling artifacts in bitmaps. So your app should include alternative
   bitmaps at a higher resolution.

   Learn how to provide alternative bitmaps.

Vector graphics

   For simple types of images (usually icons), you can avoid creating
   separate images for each density by using vector graphics. Because
   vector graphics define the illustration with geometric line paths
   instead of pixels, they can be drawn at any size without scaling
   artifacts.

   Learn more about using vector graphics.

Wear OS, TV, Auto, and Chrome OS

   The recommendations above apply to all Android form factors, but if you
   want to build an app for Wear OS, Android TV, Android Auto, or Chrome
   OS devices, you need to do a bit more work.

   Each of these devices have their own user interaction model that your
   app should accommodate. In some cases, such as for Wear OS, you should
   re-think your app's user experience and build an app that's specialized
   for that device. And to support Chrome OS devices (such as the Google
   Pixelbook), you might need only slight modifications to your existing
   app to support keyboard/mouse interaction and a much larger screen.

   To support these devices, refer to the following developer guides:
     * Building Apps for Wear OS
     * Building Apps for Android TV
     * Building Apps for Android Auto
     * Building Apps for Chrome OS

Screen incompatibility

   Although the Android framework and tools provide everything you need to
   make an app available to all screen configurations, you still might
   decide you don't want your app available on some screen configurations
   due to some sort of incompatibility.

   In that case, you can declare your app supports only specific screens.

Download Android Studio

   Before downloading, you must agree to the following terms and
   conditions.

Terms and Conditions

   This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

1. Introduction

   1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License
   Agreement as the "SDK" and specifically including the Android system
   files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons) is licensed to you
   subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
   forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to
   your use of the SDK. 1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for
   devices, as made available under the Android Open Source Project, which
   is located at the following URL: http://source.android.com/, as updated
   from time to time. 1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android
   device that (i) complies with the Android Compatibility Definition
   document, which can be found at the Android compatibility website
   (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from
   time to time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility
   Test Suite (CTS). 1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation
   with principal place of business at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain
   View, CA 94043, United States.

2. Accepting this License Agreement

   2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License
   Agreement. You may not use the SDK if you do not accept the License
   Agreement. 2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of
   the License Agreement. 2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept
   the License Agreement if you are a person barred from receiving the SDK
   under the laws of the United States or other countries, including the
   country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK. 2.4 If
   you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your
   employer or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full
   legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to the License
   Agreement. If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not
   accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your employer
   or other entity.

3. SDK License from Google

   3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a
   limited, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and
   non-sublicensable license to use the SDK solely to develop applications
   for compatible implementations of Android. 3.2 You may not use this SDK
   to develop applications for other platforms (including non-compatible
   implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of
   course free to develop applications for other platforms, including
   non-compatible implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is
   not used for that purpose. 3.3 You agree that Google or third parties
   own all legal right, title and interest in and to the SDK, including
   any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
   Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright
   law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary
   rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you. 3.4
   You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the
   License Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third
   party licenses, you may not copy (except for backup purposes), modify,
   adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or
   create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK. 3.5 Use,
   reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under
   an open source software license are governed solely by the terms of
   that open source software license and not the License Agreement. 3.6
   You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may
   change without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK
   may be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of
   the SDK. You agree that Google may stop (permanently or temporarily)
   providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to users
   generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. 3.7
   Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of
   Google's trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names,
   or other distinctive brand features. 3.8 You agree that you will not
   remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including
   copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained
   within the SDK.

4. Use of the SDK by You

   4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you
   (or your licensors) under the License Agreement in or to any software
   applications that you develop using the SDK, including any intellectual
   property rights that subsist in those applications. 4.2 You agree to
   use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted
   by (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or
   generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
   jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or
   software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
   4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for
   general public users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of
   those users. If the users provide you with user names, passwords, or
   other login information or personal information, you must make the
   users aware that the information will be available to your application,
   and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for
   those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive
   information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
   provides your application with Google Account information, your
   application may only use that information to access the user's Google
   Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has
   given you permission to do so. 4.4 You agree that you will not engage
   in any activity with the SDK, including the development or distribution
   of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses
   in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or
   services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or
   any mobile communications carrier. 4.5 You agree that you are solely
   responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any
   third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create,
   transmit or display through Android and/or applications for Android,
   and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage
   which Google may suffer) by doing so. 4.6 You agree that you are solely
   responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any
   third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License
   Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or
   any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including
   any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any
   such breach.

5. Your Developer Credentials

   5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the
   confidentiality of any developer credentials that may be issued to you
   by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you will be solely
   responsible for all applications that are developed under your
   developer credentials.

6. Privacy and Information

   6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may
   collect certain usage statistics from the software including but not
   limited to a unique identifier, associated IP address, version number
   of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in the
   SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this
   information is collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your
   consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be
   collected. 6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to
   improve the SDK and is maintained in accordance with Google's Privacy
   Policy.

7. Third Party Applications

   7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party
   or that access data, content or resources provided by a third party,
   you agree that Google is not responsible for those applications, data,
   content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
   resources which you may access through such third party applications
   are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated
   and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may
   experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third party
   applications, data, content, or resources. 7.2 You should be aware the
   data, content, and resources presented to you through such a third
   party application may be protected by intellectual property rights
   which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on
   their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute
   or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources
   (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given
   permission to do so by the relevant owners. 7.3 You acknowledge that
   your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources
   may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third
   party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal
   relationship with these third parties.

8. Using Android APIs

   8.1 Google Data APIs 8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from
   Google, you acknowledge that the data may be protected by intellectual
   property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that provide
   the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use
   of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may
   not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative
   works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by
   the relevant Terms of Service. 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a
   user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that you shall
   retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and
   for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission
   to do so. If you use the Android Recognition Service API, documented at
   the following URL:
   https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionServi
   ce, as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the
   API is subject to the Data Processing Addendum for Products where
   Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the following URL:
   https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/, as updated
   from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms
   of the Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data
   Processor.

9. Terminating this License Agreement

   9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by
   either you or Google as set out below. 9.2 If you want to terminate the
   License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the SDK and any
   relevant developer credentials. 9.3 Google may at any time, terminate
   the License Agreement with you if: (A) you have breached any provision
   of the License Agreement; or (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
   (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as
   APIs) to you has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to
   offer certain parts of the SDK to you; or (D) Google decides to no
   longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
   country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or
   the provision of the SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is,
   in Google's sole discretion, no longer commercially viable. 9.4 When
   the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights,
   obligations and liabilities that you and Google have benefited from,
   been subject to (or which have accrued over time whilst the License
   Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
   indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions
   of paragraph 14.7 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations
   and liabilities indefinitely.

10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES

   10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT
   YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE"
   WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM GOOGLE. 10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND
   ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE
   SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE
   FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA
   THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE. 10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL
   WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
   INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
   MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

   11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES
   AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY
   THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
   CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU,
   INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS
   REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.

12. Indemnification

   12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend,
   indemnify and hold harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective
   directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all
   claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any and all losses,
   liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable
   attorneys fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the
   SDK, (b) any application you develop on the SDK that infringes any
   copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent or other
   intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or
   violates their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any
   non-compliance by you with the License Agreement.

13. Changes to the License Agreement

   13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes
   new versions of the SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make
   a new version of the License Agreement available on the website where
   the SDK is made available.

14. General Legal Terms

   14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement
   between you and Google and governs your use of the SDK (excluding any
   services which Google may provide to you under a separate written
   agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you
   and Google in relation to the SDK. 14.2 You agree that if Google does
   not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in
   the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
   applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of
   Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be
   available to Google. 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction
   to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of the License
   Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
   License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement.
   The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be
   valid and enforceable. 14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member
   of the group of companies of which Google is the parent shall be third
   party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
   companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any
   provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights
   in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be
   third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement. 14.5 EXPORT
   RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND
   REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT
   LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE
   RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE. 14.6 The rights
   granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
   either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other
   party. Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their
   responsibilities or obligations under the License Agreement without the
   prior written approval of the other party. 14.7 The License Agreement,
   and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be
   governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its
   conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the
   exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa
   Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the License
   Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
   allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of
   urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction. January 16, 2019

   or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources
   (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given
   permission to do so by the relevant owners. 7.3 You acknowledge that
   your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources
   may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third
   party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal
   relationship with these third parties.

   not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in
   the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
   applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of
   Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be
   available to Google. 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction
   to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of the License
   Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the

   The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be
   valid and enforceable. 14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member
   of the group of companies of which Google is the parent shall be third
   party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other

   in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be
   third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement. 14.5 EXPORT

   prior written approval of the other party. 14.7 The License Agreement,
   and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be
   governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its
   conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the
   exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa
   Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the License
   Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
   allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of
   urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction. January 16, 2019

   applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of
   Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be
   available to Google. 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction
   to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of the License
   Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
   License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement.
   The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be
   valid and enforceable. 14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member
   of the group of companies of which Google is the parent shall be third
   party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
   companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any
   provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights
   in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be
   third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement. 14.5 EXPORT
   RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND
   REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT
   LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE

   granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
   either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other
   party. Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their
   responsibilities or obligations under the License Agreement without the
   prior written approval of the other party. 14.7 The License Agreement,
   and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be
   governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its
   conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the
   exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa
   Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the License
   Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
   allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of
   urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction. January 16, 2019

   other login information or personal information, you must make the
   users aware that the information will be available to your application,
   and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for
   those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive
   information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
   provides your application with Google Account information, your
   application may only use that information to access the user's Google
   Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has
   given you permission to do so. 4.4 You agree that you will not engage
   in any activity with the SDK, including the development or distribution

   which Google may suffer) by doing so. 4.6 You agree that you are solely
   responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any
   third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License
   Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or
   any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including
   any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any
   such breach.

5. Your Developer Credentials

   5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the
   confidentiality of any developer credentials that may be issued to you
   by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you will be solely
   responsible for all applications that are developed under your
   developer credentials.

6. Privacy and Information

   6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may
   collect certain usage statistics from the software including but not
   limited to a unique identifier, associated IP address, version number
   of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in the
   SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this
   information is collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your
   consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be
   collected. 6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to

   or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources
   (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given
   permission to do so by the relevant owners. 7.3 You acknowledge that
   your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources
   may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third
   party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal
   relationship with these third parties.

8. Using Android APIs

   8.1 Google Data APIs 8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from
   Google, you acknowledge that the data may be protected by intellectual
   property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that provide
   the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use
   of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may
   not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative
   works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by
   the relevant Terms of Service. 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a
   user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that you shall
   retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and
   for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission

   either you or Google as set out below. 9.2 If you want to terminate the
   License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the SDK and any
   relevant developer credentials. 9.3 Google may at any time, terminate
   the License Agreement with you if: (A) you have breached any provision
   of the License Agreement; or (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
   (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as
   APIs) to you has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to
   offer certain parts of the SDK to you; or (D) Google decides to no
   longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
   country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or
   the provision of the SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is,
   in Google's sole discretion, no longer commercially viable. 9.4 When
   the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights,
   obligations and liabilities that you and Google have benefited from,
   been subject to (or which have accrued over time whilst the License
   Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
   indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions
   of paragraph 14.7 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations
   and liabilities indefinitely.

   AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY
   THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
   CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU,
   INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS
   REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.

   and Google in relation to the SDK. 14.2 You agree that if Google does
   not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in
   the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
   applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of
   Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be
   available to Google. 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction
   to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of the License
   Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the

   prior written approval of the other party. 14.7 The License Agreement,
   and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be
   governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its
   conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the
   exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa
   Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the License
   Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
   allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of
   urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction. January 16, 2019

   in Google's sole discretion, no longer commercially viable. 9.4 When
   the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights,
   obligations and liabilities that you and Google have benefited from,
   been subject to (or which have accrued over time whilst the License
   Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
   indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions
   of paragraph 14.7 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations
   and liabilities indefinitely.

10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES

   YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE"
   WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM GOOGLE. 10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND

   INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS
   REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.

12. Indemnification

   12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend,
   indemnify and hold harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective
   directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all

14. General Legal Terms

   14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement
   between you and Google and governs your use of the SDK (excluding any
   services which Google may provide to you under a separate written
   agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you
   and Google in relation to the SDK. 14.2 You agree that if Google does
   not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in
   the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
   applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of
   Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be
   available to Google. 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction
   to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of the License
   Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
   License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement.
   The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be
   valid and enforceable. 14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member
   of the group of companies of which Google is the parent shall be third
   party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
   companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any
   provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights
   in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be
   third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement. 14.5 EXPORT
   RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND
   REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT
   LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE
   RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE. 14.6 The rights
   granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
   either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other
   party. Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their
   responsibilities or obligations under the License Agreement without the
   prior written approval of the other party. 14.7 The License Agreement,
   and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be
   governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its
   conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the
   exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa
   Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the License
   Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
   allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of
   urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction. January 16, 2019

   limited, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and
   non-sublicensable license to use the SDK solely to develop applications
   for compatible implementations of Android. 3.2 You may not use this SDK

   applications that you develop using the SDK, including any intellectual
   property rights that subsist in those applications. 4.2 You agree to
   use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted

   software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
   4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for
   general public users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of

   other login information or personal information, you must make the
   users aware that the information will be available to your application,
   and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for
   those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive
   information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
   provides your application with Google Account information, your
   application may only use that information to access the user's Google
   Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has
   given you permission to do so. 4.4 You agree that you will not engage
   in any activity with the SDK, including the development or distribution
   of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses

   any mobile communications carrier. 4.5 You agree that you are solely
   responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any
   third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create,

   which Google may suffer) by doing so. 4.6 You agree that you are solely
   responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any
   third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License
   Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or
   any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including
   any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any
   such breach.

5. Your Developer Credentials

   5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the
   confidentiality of any developer credentials that may be issued to you
   by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you will be solely
   responsible for all applications that are developed under your
   developer credentials.

6. Privacy and Information

   6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may
   collect certain usage statistics from the software including but not
   limited to a unique identifier, associated IP address, version number
   of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in the
   SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this
   information is collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your
   consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be
   collected. 6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to
   improve the SDK and is maintained in accordance with Google's Privacy
   Policy.

   experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third party
   applications, data, content, or resources. 7.2 You should be aware the
   data, content, and resources presented to you through such a third
   party application may be protected by intellectual property rights

   or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources
   (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given
   permission to do so by the relevant owners. 7.3 You acknowledge that
   your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources
   may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third
   party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal
   relationship with these third parties.

8. Using Android APIs

   8.1 Google Data APIs 8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from
   Google, you acknowledge that the data may be protected by intellectual
   property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that provide

   of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may
   not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative
   works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by
   the relevant Terms of Service. 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a
   user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that you shall
   retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and
   for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission

   License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the SDK and any
   relevant developer credentials. 9.3 Google may at any time, terminate
   the License Agreement with you if: (A) you have breached any provision

   your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources
   may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third
   party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal
   relationship with these third parties.

   not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in
   the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
   applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of
   Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be
   available to Google. 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction
   to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of the License
   Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
   License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement.
   The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be
   valid and enforceable. 14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member
   of the group of companies of which Google is the parent shall be third
   party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
   companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any
   provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights
   in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be
   third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement. 14.5 EXPORT
   RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND

   granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
   either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other
   party. Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their
   responsibilities or obligations under the License Agreement without the
   prior written approval of the other party. 14.7 The License Agreement,
   and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be
   governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its
   conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the
   exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa
   Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the License
   Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
   allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of
   urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction. January 16, 2019

   limited, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and
   non-sublicensable license to use the SDK solely to develop applications
   for compatible implementations of Android. 3.2 You may not use this SDK

   users aware that the information will be available to your application,
   and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for
   those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive
   information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
   provides your application with Google Account information, your
   application may only use that information to access the user's Google
   Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has
   given you permission to do so. 4.4 You agree that you will not engage
   in any activity with the SDK, including the development or distribution

   any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any
   such breach.

5. Your Developer Credentials

   5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the
   confidentiality of any developer credentials that may be issued to you

   or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources
   (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given
   permission to do so by the relevant owners. 7.3 You acknowledge that
   your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources
   may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third
   party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal
   relationship with these third parties.

   an open source software license are governed solely by the terms of
   that open source software license and not the License Agreement. 3.6
   You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may
   change without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK
   may be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of

4. Use of the SDK by You

   4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you
   (or your licensors) under the License Agreement in or to any software
   applications that you develop using the SDK, including any intellectual
   property rights that subsist in those applications. 4.2 You agree to
   use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted
   by (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or

   software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
   4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for
   general public users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of
   those users. If the users provide you with user names, passwords, or
   other login information or personal information, you must make the
   users aware that the information will be available to your application,
   and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for
   those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive
   information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
   provides your application with Google Account information, your
   application may only use that information to access the user's Google
   Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has
   given you permission to do so. 4.4 You agree that you will not engage
   in any activity with the SDK, including the development or distribution
   of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses
   in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or

   which Google may suffer) by doing so. 4.6 You agree that you are solely
   responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any
   third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License
   Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or
   any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including
   any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any
   such breach.

5. Your Developer Credentials

   5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the
   confidentiality of any developer credentials that may be issued to you
   by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you will be solely
   responsible for all applications that are developed under your
   developer credentials.

6. Privacy and Information

   6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may
   collect certain usage statistics from the software including but not
   limited to a unique identifier, associated IP address, version number
   of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in the
   SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this
   information is collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your
   consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be
   collected. 6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to
   improve the SDK and is maintained in accordance with Google's Privacy
   Policy.

   content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
   resources which you may access through such third party applications
   are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated
   and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may
   experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third party
   applications, data, content, or resources. 7.2 You should be aware the
   data, content, and resources presented to you through such a third
   party application may be protected by intellectual property rights
   which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on
   their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute
   or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources
   (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given
   permission to do so by the relevant owners. 7.3 You acknowledge that
   your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources
   may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third
   party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal
   relationship with these third parties.

8. Using Android APIs

   8.1 Google Data APIs 8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from
   Google, you acknowledge that the data may be protected by intellectual
   property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that provide

   of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may
   not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative

   the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights,
   obligations and liabilities that you and Google have benefited from,
   been subject to (or which have accrued over time whilst the License
   Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
   indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions
   of paragraph 14.7 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations
   and liabilities indefinitely.

   applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of
   Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be
   available to Google. 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction
   to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of the License
   Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the

   in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be
   third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement. 14.5 EXPORT

   conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the
   exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa
   Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the License
   Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
   allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of

   2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License
   Agreement. You may not use the SDK if you do not accept the License
   Agreement. 2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of
   the License Agreement. 2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept

   accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your employer
   or other entity.

3. SDK License from Google

   3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a
   limited, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and
   non-sublicensable license to use the SDK solely to develop applications
   for compatible implementations of Android. 3.2 You may not use this SDK
   to develop applications for other platforms (including non-compatible
   implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of
   course free to develop applications for other platforms, including
   non-compatible implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is
   not used for that purpose. 3.3 You agree that Google or third parties
   own all legal right, title and interest in and to the SDK, including
   any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
   Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright
   law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary
   rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you. 3.4
   You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the
   License Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third
   party licenses, you may not copy (except for backup purposes), modify,
   adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or
   create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK. 3.5 Use,
   reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under
   an open source software license are governed solely by the terms of
   that open source software license and not the License Agreement. 3.6
   You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may
   change without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK
   may be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of
   the SDK. You agree that Google may stop (permanently or temporarily)
   providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to users
   generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. 3.7

   copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained
   within the SDK.

4. Use of the SDK by You

   4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you
   (or your licensors) under the License Agreement in or to any software
   applications that you develop using the SDK, including any intellectual
   property rights that subsist in those applications. 4.2 You agree to
   use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted
   by (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or
   generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
   jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or
   software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
   4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for
   general public users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of
   those users. If the users provide you with user names, passwords, or
   other login information or personal information, you must make the
   users aware that the information will be available to your application,
   and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for
   those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive
   information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
   provides your application with Google Account information, your
   application may only use that information to access the user's Google
   Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has
   given you permission to do so. 4.4 You agree that you will not engage
   in any activity with the SDK, including the development or distribution
   of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses
   in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or
   services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or
   any mobile communications carrier. 4.5 You agree that you are solely
   responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any
   third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create,
   transmit or display through Android and/or applications for Android,
   and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage
   which Google may suffer) by doing so. 4.6 You agree that you are solely
   responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any
   third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License
   Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or
   any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including
   any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any
   such breach.

5. Your Developer Credentials

   5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the
   confidentiality of any developer credentials that may be issued to you
   by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you will be solely
   responsible for all applications that are developed under your
   developer credentials.

6. Privacy and Information

   6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may
   collect certain usage statistics from the software including but not
   limited to a unique identifier, associated IP address, version number
   of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in the
   SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this
   information is collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your
   consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be
   collected. 6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to
   improve the SDK and is maintained in accordance with Google's Privacy
   Policy.

7. Third Party Applications

   7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party
   or that access data, content or resources provided by a third party,
   you agree that Google is not responsible for those applications, data,
   content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
   resources which you may access through such third party applications
   are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated
   and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may
   experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third party
   applications, data, content, or resources. 7.2 You should be aware the
   data, content, and resources presented to you through such a third
   party application may be protected by intellectual property rights
   which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on
   their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute
   or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources
   (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given
   permission to do so by the relevant owners. 7.3 You acknowledge that
   your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources
   may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third
   party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal
   relationship with these third parties.

8. Using Android APIs

   8.1 Google Data APIs 8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from
   Google, you acknowledge that the data may be protected by intellectual
   property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that provide
   the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use
   of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may
   not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative
   works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by
   the relevant Terms of Service. 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a
   user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that you shall
   retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and
   for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission
   to do so. If you use the Android Recognition Service API, documented at
   the following URL:
   https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionServi

   from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms
   of the Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data
   Processor.

9. Terminating this License Agreement

   9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by
   either you or Google as set out below. 9.2 If you want to terminate the
   License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the SDK and any
   relevant developer credentials. 9.3 Google may at any time, terminate
   the License Agreement with you if: (A) you have breached any provision
   of the License Agreement; or (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
   (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as
   APIs) to you has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to
   offer certain parts of the SDK to you; or (D) Google decides to no
   longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
   country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or
   the provision of the SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is,
   in Google's sole discretion, no longer commercially viable. 9.4 When
   the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights,
   obligations and liabilities that you and Google have benefited from,
   been subject to (or which have accrued over time whilst the License
   Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
   indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions
   of paragraph 14.7 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations
   and liabilities indefinitely.

10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES

   10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT
   YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE"

   MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

   11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES
   AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY
   THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
   CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU,
   INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS
   REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.

12. Indemnification

   12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend,
   indemnify and hold harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective
   directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all
   claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any and all losses,
   liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable
   attorneys fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the
   SDK, (b) any application you develop on the SDK that infringes any
   copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent or other
   intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or
   violates their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any
   non-compliance by you with the License Agreement.

13. Changes to the License Agreement

   13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes
   new versions of the SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make
   a new version of the License Agreement available on the website where

   14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement
   between you and Google and governs your use of the SDK (excluding any
   services which Google may provide to you under a separate written
   agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you
   and Google in relation to the SDK. 14.2 You agree that if Google does
   not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in
   the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
   applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of
   Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be
   available to Google. 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction
   to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of the License
   Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
   License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement.
   The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be
   valid and enforceable. 14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member
   of the group of companies of which Google is the parent shall be third
   party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
   companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any
   provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights
   in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be
   third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement. 14.5 EXPORT
   RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND
   REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT
   LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE
   RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE. 14.6 The rights
   granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
   either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other
   party. Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their
   responsibilities or obligations under the License Agreement without the
   prior written approval of the other party. 14.7 The License Agreement,
   and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be
   governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its
   conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the
   exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa
   Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the License
   Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
   allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of
   urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction. January 16, 2019

   REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.

12. Indemnification

   12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend,
   indemnify and hold harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective
   directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all
   claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any and all losses,
   liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable
   attorneys fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the
   SDK, (b) any application you develop on the SDK that infringes any
   copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent or other
   intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or
   violates their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any
   non-compliance by you with the License Agreement.

13. Changes to the License Agreement

   13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes
   new versions of the SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make
   a new version of the License Agreement available on the website where
   the SDK is made available.

14. General Legal Terms

   14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement
   between you and Google and governs your use of the SDK (excluding any
   services which Google may provide to you under a separate written
   agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you
   and Google in relation to the SDK. 14.2 You agree that if Google does
   not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in
   the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
   applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of
   Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be
   available to Google. 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction
   to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of the License
   Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
   License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement.
   The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be
   valid and enforceable. 14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member
   of the group of companies of which Google is the parent shall be third
   party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
   companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any
   provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights
   in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be
   third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement. 14.5 EXPORT
   RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND
   REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT
   LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE
   RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE. 14.6 The rights
   granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
   either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other
   party. Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their
   responsibilities or obligations under the License Agreement without the
   prior written approval of the other party. 14.7 The License Agreement,
   and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be
   governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its
   conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the
   exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa
   Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the License
   Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
   allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of
   urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction. January 16, 2019
   [ ] I have read and agree with the above terms and conditions
