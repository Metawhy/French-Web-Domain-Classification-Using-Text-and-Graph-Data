   Stéphane Mayer, CEO of Nexter reelected Chairman of GICAT

   Chairman of GICAT since July 2016, he is therefore renewed in his
   duties proposing a roadmap which is a continuation of the actions
   carried out by the group for two years, with a new impetus:
     * Reinforced dialogue: continue exchanges with institutional actors,
       in particular those of the Ministries of defense and internal
       affairs, to best meet the objectives and needs of the French
       defense and security strategies;
     *  Innovation: further increase our capacity to innovate, in line
       with the ambitions of the different ministries, by exploiting the
       synergies between the members of the cluster (large groups, SMEs
       and mid-cap companies, research centers and start-ups);
     * Export: contribute to the success of our members with more services
       and exhibitions and keep the world  leadership for land forces
       exhibitions with the next edition of Eurosatory in 2020;
     * Europe: support our members via a greater presence in Brussels
       particularly within the framework of  the European Fund of Defense
       development and the funding which can result from it;
     * Sector: strengthen support to the land and air-land industrial
       sector to meet current and future challenges, such as the SCORPION
       program or the Olympic Games 2024;
     * SMEs: continue to represent SMEs and meet their expectations,
       particularly in the context of the new SME Action Plan.
