The Tbilisi Centre for Mathematical Sciences

   The Tbilisi Centre for Mathematical Sciences (TCMS) is a
   non-governmental and nonprofit independent academic institution founded
   in November 2008 in Tbilisi, Georgia. The general aim of the TCMS is to
   facilitate new impetus for development in various areas of mathematical
   sciences in Georgia. TCMS promotes further successful research in
   fundamental areas of mathematics and computational sciences in Georgia,
   supports advanced scientists who want to work on modern problems in
   leading scientific centers and universities all over the world,
   develops new scientific contacts and opportunities for mutual
   scientific and economic benefit, and improves overall conditions for
   conducting scientific research and education in Georgia.

   The TCMS publishes two journals, and Project Euclid is proud to host
   the Tbilisi Mathematical Journal as part of the Euclid Prime
   Collection. Tbilisi Mathematical Journal is a fully refereed
   international journal publishing original research papers in all areas
   of mathematics. The editor-in-chief is Hvedri Inassaridze, Director of
   the TCMS.
