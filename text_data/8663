Lemon Juice and Weight Loss

   November 2, 2015 By Joel A.


   preparing lemon juice

   The sour taste of lemons is derived from the high amounts of citric
   acid found naturally in this yellow citrus fruit. The concentrated acid
   has been widely used for both culinary and non-culinary purposes. One
   of the more popular non-culinary uses of lemon is to help weight loss.

   Benefits of lemon juice

   When used for dieting, lemon juice affects how digestive enzymes and
   acids in the digestive track work. The consumption of high amounts of
   acid found in lemons helps lower the absorption rates of sugars. This
   means that less amounts of unused sugar will be turned into fat.

   While the citric acid in lemons blocks sugars, it also helps increase
   the bodyâ€™s ability to absorb calcium. The calcium absorbed from food is
   then stored in existing fat cells. Calcium is believed to help enhance
   the bodyâ€™s natural ability to burn fat cells.

   Lemons can also help with a personâ€™s outside appearance. The high
   amounts of vitamin C in the fruit will help rejuvenate the skin and
   bring back its natural glow. Lemon juice also promotes quick bursts of
   energy in the body.

   Lemon juice ideas

   There are many ways to consume lemon juice throughout the day. One
   simple method of consuming lemon juice is to put some fresh lemon
   slices in a warm bottle of water and drink immediately after waking up
   in the morning. Other methods of drinking lemon juice include:
     * Include a slice of lemon with every glass of water you drink
       throughout the day.
     * Mix lemon juice with some natural honey in warm water and drink at
       night before going to bed.
     * Make fruit infused water with other natural fruits to add variety
       to your drink choices.

   There are many benefits to drinking lemon juice, including weight loss.
   When dieting, make a plan to consume an entire lemonâ€™s worth of juice
   per day. This will help speed up the weight loss process and help make
   you feel energized and beautiful in the process.
