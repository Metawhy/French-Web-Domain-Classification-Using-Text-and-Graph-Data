Sustainable Development Goals

   The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the world's best plan
   to build a better world for people and our planet by 2030. Adopted by
   all United Nations Member States in 2015, the SDGs are a call for
   action by all countries - poor, rich and middle-income - to promote
   prosperity while protecting the environment. They recognize that ending
   poverty must go hand-in-hand with strategies that build economic growth
   and address a range of social needs including education, health,
   equality and job opportunities, while tackling climate change and
   working to preserve our ocean and forests.

   The Division for Sustainable Development Goals (DSDG) in the United
   Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) provides
   substantive support and capacity-building for the SDGs and their
   related thematic issues, including water, energy, climate, oceans,
   urbanization, transport, science and technology, the Global Sustainable
   Development Report (GSDR), partnerships and Small Island Developing
   States. DSDG plays a key role in the evaluation of UN systemwide
   implementation of the 2030 Agenda and on advocacy and outreach
   activities relating to the SDGs.
