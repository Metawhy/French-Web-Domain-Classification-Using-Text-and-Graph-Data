Center on Children & Families

   The Center on Children and Families is an interdisciplinary center
   committed to filling the need for high quality advocacy by creating
   programs and resources that bring an interdisciplinary, evidence-based
   and child-centered approach to issues of children’s law and policy.

                           Early Childhood Project

Mission

   The mission of the Center on Children and Families is to promote the
   highest quality of advocacy, teaching and scholarship in the areas of
   child & family law and policy. We believe that children, as the least
   powerful of our citizens, are most in need of high quality advocacy.
   They must depend on adults – parents, teachers, doctors and lawyers –
   to vindicate their rights to protection from abuse and to overcome
   barriers to education and health care. Children cannot lobby for
   legislation or retain high-powered lawyers and costly experts. While
   great strides have been made in educating family lawyers, we believe
   that too few professionals have the breadth of training necessary to
   advocate effectively for children and their families.
   Our Center is committed to filling the need for high quality advocacy,
   teaching and scholarship by creating programs and resources that bring
   an interdisciplinary, evidence-based and child-centered approach to
   issues of children’s law and policy. Through its Certificate in Family
   Law, Family Advocacy Clinic, Gator TeamChild Juvenile Law, Annual
   Conferences, Publications, and Student Fellowships, the Center on
   Children and Families is training a new generation of advocates for a
   new era.

Goals

     * Promote quality scholarship on issues of importance to children and
       their families.
     * Train a new generation of advocates for children and their
       families.
     * Educate children about their rights and responsibilities in a free
       society, and
     * Promote interdisciplinary and child-centered methods for studying
       systems serving children and their families.

Kenneth Nunn

Professor of Law

   "Our students leave UF Law with a commitment to excellence. I think
   there is more of a focus on teaching at our law school than there is at
   other elite legal education institutions. I think that our faculty
   makes it a point to try and bring in interesting speakers and to have
   novel lectures that stimulate their students."
   Faculty

Gregory Weiss

Shareholder, Mrachek Law

   "My piece of advice for first-year law students is to meet as many
   people in your class as you can and become friendly with as many people
   as you can. The relationships you form from day one of law school are
   going to last for the next 50 years of your legal career."
   Alumni

Isabella Limonta

Class of 2020

   "Being a student at the University of Florida has opened up doors that
   I would have otherwise never even seen. No other school could offer
   such a vast network of opportunities, making me feel surprisingly at
   ease during the first round of job searches."
