About the Android Open Source Project

   Android is an open source operating system for mobile devices and a
   corresponding open source project led by Google. This site and the
   Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository offer the information and
   source code needed to create custom variants of the Android OS, port
   devices and accessories to the Android platform, and ensure devices
   meet the compatibility requirements that keep the Android ecosystem a
   healthy and stable environment for millions of users.
   As an open source project, Android's goal is to avoid any central point
   of failure in which one industry player can restrict or control the
   innovations of any other player. To that end, Android is a full,
   production-quality operating system for consumer products, complete
   with customizable source code that can be ported to nearly any device
   and public documentation that is available to everyone (in English at
   source.android.com and in Simplified Chinese at
   source.android.google.cn).
   Just as you can contribute code to AOSP, you can also contribute to
   AOSP documentationâ€”and we want your input! Android's flexibility and
   ever-changing codebase means this site needs your feedback to keep
   content fresh, accurate, and relevant to Android implementors. We
   encourage you to check the changelog for details on recent AOSP updates
   and to report bugs or offer suggestions using the Site Feedback at the
   bottom of every page (or by visiting g.co/androidsourceissue).
