Details

   The future of healthcare lies in the continued progress and
   acceleration of adopting translational science. The two principal
   constructs, translational research and translational effectiveness,
   collectively strive towards patient-centered, effectiveness-focused and
   evidence-based care. Translational research is the application of
   scientific methods into healthcare decision-making and practice.
   Through these applications and methods used on the patient,
   translational research obtains new information that directly benefits
   that patient in return. This bench-to-bedside approach is specifically
   designed to improve health outcomes and standards of practice in
   healthcare to better serve the patients. It is through the utilization,
   dissemination, and implementation of the best evidence-based practices
   that will help in the understanding of intervention effectiveness.

   The chapters in this book highlight the transfer of basic science
   discovered and cutting-edge developments into clinical applications.
   Emphasis on continuing research, increasing transparency and
   accelerating the adoption of translational science into clinical
   practice is needed to provide the best possible care. The chapters
   focus on the future direction of all fields of healthcare which lies on
   the bench-to-bedside approach – from medicine to dentistry to nursing.
   Translational research is at the forefront of efforts to improve
   patient care and is the engine of change for bringing new
   decision-making, practice, and technology into the field of healthcare
   in this new age.

   Works related to identification of harmful exhaust components from
   aviation engines have continued since the second half of the last
   century. These works focus on high-thrust turbine engines. For this,
   group testing and standardization procedures have been developed
   containing the admissible limits of exhaust components. Since 2007
   works have been underway related to the identification of harmful
   exhaust components from engines of low power output that have not yet
   been included in the emissions legislation. These actions are
   particularly related to the measurements of the exhaust emissions from
   piston aviation engines and they are focused on the fuel applied for
   these engines. This book presents the results of the author’s own
   research work related to the issues of exhaust emissions from
   powertrains of aircraft and helicopters fitted with piston or turbine
   engines not yet included in the emission legislation.

   Research has been presented for turbocharged piston and jet engines
   aircraft. Test procedures have been presented related to the
   measurement of the exhaust emission under actual conditions of
   operation. The study presents analyses of the operating conditions of
   aviation engines, for which data from the on-board recording devices
   (flight parameters) have been used. Tests have been developed related
   to the engines operating under actual operating (in-flight) conditions.
   The methodology of the developed test has been validated based on a
   test dedicated for an aircraft fitted with a jet engine. The test
   results have been subject to a comparison with the results of tests
   applicable in the homologation procedures. Eventually, the authors
   proposed exhaust emissions tests dedicated to individual aircraft
   groups. (Imprint: Nova)

   This first edition of “Single Best Answer Questions in Cardiothoracic
   Surgery” provides a comprehensive revision aid to the candidates taking
   the specialty examination in Cardiothoracic Surgery worldwide. This new
   revision aid provides over 300 single best answer practice questions in
   Cardiothoracic Surgery and conforms to the recent changes in the format
   of specialty examinations in Cardiothoracic Surgery. Each question has
   been carefully formulated to cover an important topic in cardiothoracic
   surgery. The questions cover the complete specialty examination
   syllabus and a considerable number of these have been based on previous
   examination questions.

   This book contains a substantial number of patient-based questions or
   clinical vignettes that will enable prospective candidates to test
   their ability to integrate key basic science concepts with relevant
   clinical problems. In addition factual recall questions have also been
   included that probe for basic recall of facts. Detailed and
   comprehensive explanations, rather than just brief answers, to
   questions have been provided so that the candidates do not have to
   consult textbooks for clarification as is the case with most other MCQs
   books currently available in the market. A list of relevant references
   is provided at the end of each answer to enable candidates to read the
   most up to date journal articles on the subject.

   The questions in this book can be used in a number of ways: (1) as a
   diagnostic tool (pretest), (2) as a guide and focus for further study,
   and (3) for self-assessment. The least effective use of these questions
   is to “study” them by reading them one at a time, and then looking at
   the correct response. These over 300 practice questions are intended to
   be an integral part of a well-planned review as well as an isolated
   resource. If used appropriately, these questions can provide
   self-assessment information beyond a numeric score. Furthermore, the
   questions have been planned in such a way that this book can be used as
   companion to any textbook of Cardiothoracic Surgery. (Imprint: Nova

Details

   Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy characterized by
   the clonal expansion of monoclonal immunoglobulin-secreting plasma
   cells in the bone marrow (BM). Multiple myeloma is associated with
   lytic bone lesions, anemia, immunodeficiency and renal impairment.
   Multiple myeloma accounts for more than 10% of all hematologic
   malignancies and about 1% of all cancers.

   Multiple myeloma remains mostly incurable despite conventional
   intensive high dose chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem cell
   transplant. The costs associated with multiple myeloma are among the
   highest. This book discusses the diagnosis of multiple myeloma along
   with the risk factors involved and the treatments that are available.
