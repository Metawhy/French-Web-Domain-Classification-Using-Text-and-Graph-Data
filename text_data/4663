Academics

Undergraduates

   Our goal is to provide students with a balance of intellectual and
   practical experiences that enable them to address a variety of societal
   needs, and prepares students for entry-level work as mechanical
   engineers or for graduate study in engineering.

   Kick off your journey

Graduate Students

   We aim to align academic course work with research to prepare scholars
   in specialized areas within the field. Areas of specialization include
   automatic controls, energy systems, fluid mechanics, design, and more.

Our People

Sindy Tang

   “My research is dedicated to solving problems at the interface of
   engineering, soft matter and biology using microfluidics. Applications
   include biochemical sensing and diagnostics, water and energy
   sustainability."

Ovijit Chaudhuri

   “My lab focuses on elucidating the mechanics of cell-matrix
   interactions in soft tissues. We seek to understand how the mechanical
   properties of the extracellular matrix regulate processes such as
   breast cancer progression, stem cell differentiation, and cell
   division.”

Research Themes and Groups

   We work with an emphasis in five major research themes that together
   reflect the department’s focus and methodologies

   Biomedicine


   Computational Engineering

   Design


   Energy

   Multi-Scale Engineering


Faculty Groups

   There are five groupings of faculty within the Department of Mechanical
   Engineering that contribute to one or more of our research themes.

Design

   The Design Group emphasizes cognitive skill development for creative
   design. Design offers graduate and undergraduate programs in Product
   Design and is centrally involved with Stanford’s d.school.

   Design

Flow Physics & Computational Engineering (FPCE)

   Flow Physics and Computational Engineering Group develops new theories,
   models, and computational tools for engineering design analysis and
   control of physical phenomena in engineering systems.

   FPCE


Mechanics and Computation (MC)

   Mechanics and Computation covers theoretical and applied mechanics,
   continuum mechanics, finite element analysis, and computational
   simulation.

   MC

Thermosciences

   The Thermosciences Group conducts experimental and analytical research
   on fundamental and applied topics in thermal and fluid systems.

   Thermosciences

Biomechanical (BME)

   BME's teaching and research focus primarily on
   musculoskeletal biomechanics, neuromuscular biomechanics,
   cardiovascular biomechanics, and rehabilitation engineering.
