Why We Disagree With the Bundeskartellamt

   By Yvonne Cunnane, Head of Data Protection, Facebook Ireland and Nikhil
   Shanbhag, Director and Associate General Counsel

   Today, Germany’s Bundeskartellamt (FCO) issued an order in the inquiry
   it began in March 2016. While we’ve cooperated with the
   Bundeskartellamt for nearly three years and will continue our
   discussions, we disagree with their conclusions and intend to appeal so
   that people in Germany continue to benefit fully from all our services.
   The Bundeskartellamt underestimates the fierce competition we face in
   Germany, misinterprets our compliance with GDPR and undermines the
   mechanisms European law provides for ensuring consistent data
   protection standards across the EU.

   The protection of personal data is a fundamental right in the EU and
   everyone gets equal protections as part of the GDPR regardless of the
   size of the company involved. Over the past year, lawmakers and data
   protection regulators have put in place new safeguards over people’s
   information, raised fair questions about the practices of many
   companies, including Facebook, and initiated investigations when
   warranted. We support the GDPR and take our obligations seriously. Yet
   the Bundeskartellamt’s decision misapplies German competition law to
   set different rules that apply to only one company.

   Popularity is not dominance. The Bundeskartellamt found in its own
   survey that over 40% of social media users in Germany don’t even use
   Facebook. We face fierce competition in Germany, yet the
   Bundeskartellamt finds it irrelevant that our apps compete directly
   with YouTube, Snapchat, Twitter and others.

   Facebook complies with the GDPR and is accountable for protecting
   people’s information. The GDPR went into effect less than a year ago
   and imposed new requirements on all companies operating in the EU,
   including Facebook. As part of complying with the GDPR, we revamped the
   information we provide people about their privacy and the controls they
   have over their information. We’ve introduced new and improved privacy
   experiences for everyone on Facebook, including asking everyone around
   the world to make choices about the ads they see and more. We’ll soon
   introduce Clear History, a tool where you’ll be able to see the
   information we receive from the websites and services who use our
   business tools and disassociate it from your account. The
   Bundeskartellamt has overlooked how Facebook actually processes data
   and the steps we take to comply with the GDPR.

   The GDPR specifically empowers data protection regulators – not
   competition authorities – to determine whether companies are living up
   to their responsibilities. And data protection regulators certainly
   have the expertise to make those conclusions. The GDPR also harmonizes
   data protection laws across Europe, so everyone lives by the same rules
   of the road and regulators can consistently apply the law from country
   to country. In our case, that’s the Irish Data Protection Commission.
   The Bundeskartellamt’s order threatens to undermine this, providing
   different rights to people based on the size of the companies they do
   business with.

   Using information across services helps to make them better and protect
   people’s safety. Facebook has always been about connecting you with
   people and information you’re interested in. We tailor each person’s
   Facebook experience so it’s unique to you, and we use a variety of
   information to do this – including the information you include on your
   profile, news stories you like or share and what other services share
   with us about your use of their websites and apps. Using information
   across our services also helps us protect people’s safety and security,
   including, for example, identifying abusive behavior and disabling
   accounts tied to terrorism, child exploitation and election
   interference across both Facebook and Instagram.

   Every day, people interact with companies that connect and use data in
   similar ways. And all of this should be – and is – a legitimate area of
   focus for regulators and policymakers around the world. Yet the
   Bundeskartellamt is trying to implement an unconventional standard for
   a single company.

   This is the point we’ll continue to make to the Bundeskartellamt and
   defend these important arguments in court, so that people and
   businesses in Germany can continue to benefit from all of our services.
   We’ll also continue finding ways to improve the controls we offer and
   safeguard people’s information.

Showing More Informative Links in News Feed

   By Adam Mosseri, VP, News Feed

   Today we are making an update to help reduce low quality links in News
   Feed. We are always working to improve people’s experience in News Feed
   by showing more stories that we think people will find informative and
   entertaining.

   Our research shows that there is a tiny group of people on Facebook who
   routinely share vast amounts of public posts per day, effectively
   spamming people’s feeds. Our research further shows that the links they
   share tend to include low quality content such as clickbait,
   sensationalism, and misinformation. As a result, we want to reduce the
   influence of these spammers and deprioritize the links they share more
   frequently than regular sharers. Of course, this is only one signal
   among many others that may affect the ranking prioritization of this
   type of post. This update will only apply to links, such as an
   individual article, not to domains, Pages, videos, photos, check-ins or
   status updates.

   One of our core News Feed values is that News Feed should be
   informative. By taking steps like this to improve News Feed, we’re able
   to surface more stories that people find informative and reduce the
   spread of problematic links such as clickbait, sensationalism and
   misinformation.

   Will This Impact My Page?
   Most publishers won’t see any significant changes to their distribution
   in News Feed. Publishers that get meaningful distribution from people
   who routinely share vast amounts of public posts per day may see a
   reduction in the distribution of those specific links. As always,
   publishers should keep in mind these basic guideposts to reach their
   audience on Facebook and continue to post stories that are relevant to
   their audiences and that their readers find informative.

New Updates to Reduce Clickbait Headlines

   By Arun Babu, Engineer, Annie Liu, Engineer, and Jordan Zhang, Engineer

   People tell us they don’t like stories that are misleading, sensational
   or spammy. That includes clickbait headlines that are designed to get
   attention and lure visitors into clicking on a link. In an effort to
   support an informed community, we’re always working to determine what
   stories might have clickbait headlines so we can show them less often.

   Last year we made an update to News Feed to reduce stories from sources
   that consistently post clickbait headlines that withhold and exaggerate
   information. Today, we are making three updates that build on this work
   so that people will see even fewer clickbait stories in their feeds,
   and more of the stories they find authentic.
     * First, we are now taking into account clickbait at the individual
       post level in addition to the domain and Page level, in order to
       more precisely reduce clickbait headlines.
     * Second, in order to make this more effective, we are dividing our
       efforts into two separate signals — so we will now look at whether
       a headline withholds information or if it exaggerates information
       separately.
     * Third, we are starting to test this work in additional languages.

   How We Are Improving Our Efforts

   One of our News Feed values is authentic communication, so we’ve been
   working to understand what people find authentic and what people do
   not.

   We’ve learned from last year’s update that we can better detect
   different kinds of clickbait headlines by separately — rather than
   jointly — identifying signals that withhold or exaggerate information.

   Headlines that withhold information intentionally leave out crucial
   details or mislead people, forcing them to click to find out the
   answer. For example, “When She Looked Under Her Couch Cushions And Saw
   THIS…” Headlines that exaggerate the details of a story with
   sensational language tend to make the story seem like a bigger deal
   than it really is. For example, “WOW! Ginger tea is the secret to
   everlasting youth. You’ve GOT to see this!”

   We addressed this similarly to how we previously worked to reduce
   clickbait: We categorized hundreds of thousands of headlines as
   clickbait or not clickbait by considering if the headline exaggerates
   the details of a story, and separately if the headline withholds
   information. A team at Facebook reviewed thousands of headlines using
   these criteria, validating each other’s work to identify large sets of
   clickbait headlines.

   From there, we identify what phrases are commonly used in clickbait
   headlines that are not used in other headlines. This is similar to how
   many email spam filters work.

   Posts with clickbait headlines will appear lower in News Feed. We will
   continue to learn over time, and we hope to continue expanding this
   work to reduce clickbait in even more languages.

   Will This Impact My Page?

   We anticipate that most Pages won’t see any significant changes to
   their distribution in News Feed as a result of this update.

   Publishers that rely on clickbait headlines should expect their
   distribution to decrease. Pages should avoid headlines that withhold
   information required to understand the content of the article and
   headlines that exaggerate the article to create misleading
   expectations. If a Page stops posting clickbait and sensational
   headlines, their posts will stop being impacted by this change.

   As always, Pages should refer to our publishing best practices. We will
   learn from these changes and will continue to work on reducing
   clickbait so News Feed is a place for authentic communication.

   Update, 7/11/18: We’ve expanded clickbait demotions to posts in new
   languages, including Romanian, Turkish, Russian, Bulgarian, Dutch,
   Greek, Hungarian, and Hindi.

   Update, 12/4/18: We’ve expanded clickbait demotions to posts in new
   languages, including Indonesian and Bengali.

Reducing Links to Low-Quality Web Page Experiences

   By Jiun-Ren Lin and Shengbo Guo

   We want to help people build an informed community on Facebook. That’s
   why we’re always working to understand which posts people consider
   misleading, sensational and spammy so we can show fewer of those and
   show more informative posts instead.

   We hear from our community that they’re disappointed when they click on
   a link that leads to a web page containing little substantive content
   and that is covered in disruptive, shocking or malicious ads. People
   expect their experience after clicking on a post to be straightforward.

   Starting today, we’re rolling out an update so people see fewer posts
   and ads in News Feed that link to these low-quality web page
   experiences. Similar to the work we’re already doing to stop
   misinformation, this update will help reduce the economic incentives of
   financially-motivated spammers.

   A More Informative Experience

   We have had a policy in place since last year to prevent advertisers
   with low-quality web page experiences from advertising on our platform.
   Now, we are increasing enforcement on ads and also taking into account
   organic posts in News Feed.

   With this update, we reviewed hundreds of thousands of web pages linked
   to from Facebook to identify those that contain little substantive
   content and have a large number of disruptive, shocking or malicious
   ads. We then used artificial intelligence to understand whether new web
   pages shared on Facebook have similar characteristics. So if we
   determine a post might link to these types of low-quality web pages, it
   may show up lower in people’s feeds and may not be eligible to be an
   ad. This way people can see fewer misleading posts and more informative
   posts.

   Will This Impact My Page or Ad Account?

   These changes will roll out gradually over the coming months.
   Publishers that do not have the type of low-quality landing page
   experience referenced may see a small increase in traffic, while
   publishers who do should see a decline in traffic. This update is one
   of many signals we use to rank News Feed, so impact will vary by
   publisher, and Pages should continue posting stories their audiences
   will like.

   For advertisers and publishers looking for tips on how to improve their
   web experiences, please read the full Facebook Business post and visit
   our Help Center.

   Update October 16, 2018: Starting today, we’re rolling out an update so
   people see fewer posts that link out to low-quality sites that
   predominantly copy and republish content from other sites without
   providing unique value. We are adjusting our Publisher Guidelines
   accordingly.

Why We Disagree With the Bundeskartellamt

   By Yvonne Cunnane, Head of Data Protection, Facebook Ireland and Nikhil
   Shanbhag, Director and Associate General Counsel

   Today, Germany’s Bundeskartellamt (FCO) issued an order in the inquiry
   it began in March 2016. While we’ve cooperated with the
   Bundeskartellamt for nearly three years and will continue our
   discussions, we disagree with their conclusions and intend to appeal so
   that people in Germany continue to benefit fully from all our services.
   The Bundeskartellamt underestimates the fierce competition we face in
   Germany, misinterprets our compliance with GDPR and undermines the
   mechanisms European law provides for ensuring consistent data
   protection standards across the EU.

   The protection of personal data is a fundamental right in the EU and
   everyone gets equal protections as part of the GDPR regardless of the

   protection regulators have put in place new safeguards over people’s

   Popularity is not dominance. The Bundeskartellamt found in its own

   business tools and disassociate it from your account. The
   Bundeskartellamt has overlooked how Facebook actually processes data
   and the steps we take to comply with the GDPR.

   The GDPR specifically empowers data protection regulators – not
   competition authorities – to determine whether companies are living up
   to their responsibilities. And data protection regulators certainly
   have the expertise to make those conclusions. The GDPR also harmonizes
   data protection laws across Europe, so everyone lives by the same rules
   of the road and regulators can consistently apply the law from country
   to country. In our case, that’s the Irish Data Protection Commission.
   The Bundeskartellamt’s order threatens to undermine this, providing
   different rights to people based on the size of the companies they do
   business with.

   Using information across services helps to make them better and protect
   people’s safety. Facebook has always been about connecting you with
   people and information you’re interested in. We tailor each person’s
   Facebook experience so it’s unique to you, and we use a variety of
   information to do this – including the information you include on your
   profile, news stories you like or share and what other services share
   with us about your use of their websites and apps. Using information
   across our services also helps us protect people’s safety and security,
   including, for example, identifying abusive behavior and disabling
   accounts tied to terrorism, child exploitation and election
   interference across both Facebook and Instagram.

   Every day, people interact with companies that connect and use data in
   similar ways. And all of this should be – and is – a legitimate area of
   focus for regulators and policymakers around the world. Yet the
   Bundeskartellamt is trying to implement an unconventional standard for
   a single company.

   This is the point we’ll continue to make to the Bundeskartellamt and
   defend these important arguments in court, so that people and
   businesses in Germany can continue to benefit from all of our services.
   We’ll also continue finding ways to improve the controls we offer and
   safeguard people’s information.

Showing More Informative Links in News Feed

   By Adam Mosseri, VP, News Feed

   Today we are making an update to help reduce low quality links in News
   Feed. We are always working to improve people’s experience in News Feed
   by showing more stories that we think people will find informative and
   entertaining.

   Our research shows that there is a tiny group of people on Facebook who
   routinely share vast amounts of public posts per day, effectively
   spamming people’s feeds. Our research further shows that the links they
   share tend to include low quality content such as clickbait,
   sensationalism, and misinformation. As a result, we want to reduce the
   influence of these spammers and deprioritize the links they share more
   frequently than regular sharers. Of course, this is only one signal
   among many others that may affect the ranking prioritization of this
   type of post. This update will only apply to links, such as an
   individual article, not to domains, Pages, videos, photos, check-ins or
   status updates.

   One of our core News Feed values is that News Feed should be
   informative. By taking steps like this to improve News Feed, we’re able
   to surface more stories that people find informative and reduce the
   spread of problematic links such as clickbait, sensationalism and
   misinformation.

   Will This Impact My Page?
   Most publishers won’t see any significant changes to their distribution
   in News Feed. Publishers that get meaningful distribution from people
   who routinely share vast amounts of public posts per day may see a
   reduction in the distribution of those specific links. As always,
   publishers should keep in mind these basic guideposts to reach their
   audience on Facebook and continue to post stories that are relevant to
   their audiences and that their readers find informative.

New Updates to Reduce Clickbait Headlines

   By Arun Babu, Engineer, Annie Liu, Engineer, and Jordan Zhang, Engineer

   People tell us they don’t like stories that are misleading, sensational
   or spammy. That includes clickbait headlines that are designed to get
   attention and lure visitors into clicking on a link. In an effort to
   support an informed community, we’re always working to determine what
   stories might have clickbait headlines so we can show them less often.

   Last year we made an update to News Feed to reduce stories from sources
   that consistently post clickbait headlines that withhold and exaggerate
   information. Today, we are making three updates that build on this work
   so that people will see even fewer clickbait stories in their feeds,
   and more of the stories they find authentic.
     * First, we are now taking into account clickbait at the individual
       post level in addition to the domain and Page level, in order to
       more precisely reduce clickbait headlines.
     * Second, in order to make this more effective, we are dividing our
       efforts into two separate signals — so we will now look at whether
       a headline withholds information or if it exaggerates information
       separately.
     * Third, we are starting to test this work in additional languages.

   How We Are Improving Our Efforts

   One of our News Feed values is authentic communication, so we’ve been
   working to understand what people find authentic and what people do
   not.

   We’ve learned from last year’s update that we can better detect
   different kinds of clickbait headlines by separately — rather than
   jointly — identifying signals that withhold or exaggerate information.

   Headlines that withhold information intentionally leave out crucial
   details or mislead people, forcing them to click to find out the
   answer. For example, “When She Looked Under Her Couch Cushions And Saw
   THIS…” Headlines that exaggerate the details of a story with
   sensational language tend to make the story seem like a bigger deal
   than it really is. For example, “WOW! Ginger tea is the secret to
   everlasting youth. You’ve GOT to see this!”

   We addressed this similarly to how we previously worked to reduce
   clickbait: We categorized hundreds of thousands of headlines as
   clickbait or not clickbait by considering if the headline exaggerates
   the details of a story, and separately if the headline withholds
   information. A team at Facebook reviewed thousands of headlines using
   these criteria, validating each other’s work to identify large sets of
   clickbait headlines.

   From there, we identify what phrases are commonly used in clickbait
   headlines that are not used in other headlines. This is similar to how
   many email spam filters work.

   Posts with clickbait headlines will appear lower in News Feed. We will
   continue to learn over time, and we hope to continue expanding this
   work to reduce clickbait in even more languages.

   Will This Impact My Page?

   We anticipate that most Pages won’t see any significant changes to
   their distribution in News Feed as a result of this update.

   Publishers that rely on clickbait headlines should expect their
   distribution to decrease. Pages should avoid headlines that withhold
   information required to understand the content of the article and
   headlines that exaggerate the article to create misleading
   expectations. If a Page stops posting clickbait and sensational
   headlines, their posts will stop being impacted by this change.

   As always, Pages should refer to our publishing best practices. We will
   learn from these changes and will continue to work on reducing
   clickbait so News Feed is a place for authentic communication.

   Update, 7/11/18: We’ve expanded clickbait demotions to posts in new
   languages, including Romanian, Turkish, Russian, Bulgarian, Dutch,
   Greek, Hungarian, and Hindi.

   Update, 12/4/18: We’ve expanded clickbait demotions to posts in new
   languages, including Indonesian and Bengali.

Reducing Links to Low-Quality Web Page Experiences

   By Jiun-Ren Lin and Shengbo Guo

   We want to help people build an informed community on Facebook. That’s
   why we’re always working to understand which posts people consider
   misleading, sensational and spammy so we can show fewer of those and
   show more informative posts instead.

   We hear from our community that they’re disappointed when they click on
   a link that leads to a web page containing little substantive content
   and that is covered in disruptive, shocking or malicious ads. People
   expect their experience after clicking on a post to be straightforward.

   Starting today, we’re rolling out an update so people see fewer posts
   and ads in News Feed that link to these low-quality web page
   experiences. Similar to the work we’re already doing to stop
   misinformation, this update will help reduce the economic incentives of
   financially-motivated spammers.

   A More Informative Experience

   We have had a policy in place since last year to prevent advertisers
   with low-quality web page experiences from advertising on our platform.
   Now, we are increasing enforcement on ads and also taking into account
   organic posts in News Feed.

   With this update, we reviewed hundreds of thousands of web pages linked
   to from Facebook to identify those that contain little substantive
   content and have a large number of disruptive, shocking or malicious
   ads. We then used artificial intelligence to understand whether new web
   pages shared on Facebook have similar characteristics. So if we
   determine a post might link to these types of low-quality web pages, it
   may show up lower in people’s feeds and may not be eligible to be an
   ad. This way people can see fewer misleading posts and more informative
   posts.

   Will This Impact My Page or Ad Account?

   These changes will roll out gradually over the coming months.
   Publishers that do not have the type of low-quality landing page
   experience referenced may see a small increase in traffic, while
   publishers who do should see a decline in traffic. This update is one
   of many signals we use to rank News Feed, so impact will vary by
   publisher, and Pages should continue posting stories their audiences
   will like.

   For advertisers and publishers looking for tips on how to improve their
   web experiences, please read the full Facebook Business post and visit
   our Help Center.

   Update October 16, 2018: Starting today, we’re rolling out an update so
   people see fewer posts that link out to low-quality sites that
   predominantly copy and republish content from other sites without
   providing unique value. We are adjusting our Publisher Guidelines
   accordingly.

New Test With Related Articles

   By Sara Su, Product Manager, News Feed

   One of our main goals is to support an informed community on Facebook.
   This includes helping people have conversations about the news and
   giving people more ways to see a more complete picture of a story or
   topic.

   This work is important to us, so we’re building new products and
   exploring ways to improve our existing ones. In 2013, we launched
   Related Articles to help people discover new articles they may find
   interesting about the same topic. These articles appear in News Feed
   after people read an article.

   Today, we’re beginning to test Related Articles that might appear
   before you read an article shared in News Feed. These additional
   articles, which appear for topics many people are talking about on
   Facebook, will appear in a unit below the link. That should provide
   people easier access to additional perspectives and information,
   including articles by third-party fact checkers.

   For example, during an instance when a lot of people are discussing an
   article about a new medical advancement, we may also show you a few
   other articles below it from different publishers about the same
   medical topic.

   This is one of many tests we’re working on to improve the experiences
   people have on Facebook. We will learn from the test, and apply what we
   learn to improve the product for everyone.

   Update: August 3, 2017: Rolling Out Related Articles More Broadly
   Since starting this test, we’ve heard that Related Articles helps give
   people more perspectives and additional information, and helps them
   determine whether the news they are reading is misleading or false. So
   we’re rolling this out more broadly.

   Now, we will start using updated machine learning to detect more
   potential hoaxes to send to third-party fact checkers. If an article
   has been reviewed by fact checkers, we may show the fact checking
   stories below the original post. In addition to seeing which stories
   are disputed by third-party fact checkers, people want more context to
   make informed decisions about what they read and share. We will
   continue testing updates to Related Articles and other ongoing News
   Feed efforts to show less false news on Facebook and provide people
   context if they see false news.

   How Will This Impact My Page?

   We don’t anticipate Pages will see significant changes in reach. Pages
   should continue posting stories that are relevant to their audience.

New Signals to Show You More Authentic and Timely Stories

   By Akos Lada, Research Scientist, James Li, Research Scientist,
   and Shilin Ding, Engineering Manager

   Our goal with News Feed is to show people the stories that are most
   relevant to them. Today we’re announcing two updates to better rank
   posts in your feed:
     * Incorporating new signals to better identify and rank authentic
       content
     * A new way to predict and rank in real-time when posts might be more
       relevant to you

   New Signals to Identify Authentic Content

   One of our News Feed values is authentic communication. We’ve heard
   from our community that authentic stories are the ones that resonate
   most — those that people consider genuine and not misleading,
   sensational or spammy.

   When ranking News Feed we look at many signals personal to you, such as
   how close you are to the person or Page posting, as well as more
   universal signals like the overall engagement (likes, comments, shares)
   that a post has.

   With this update, we’re adding new universal signals to determine
   whether a post might be authentic. To do this, we categorized Pages to
   identify whether or not they were posting spam or trying to game feed
   by doing things like asking for likes, comments or shares. We then used
   posts from these Pages to train a model that continuously identifies
   whether posts from other Pages are likely to be authentic. For example,
   if Page posts are often being hidden by people reading them, that’s a
   signal that it might not be authentic.

   If a post is likely to be authentic based on the new signals we look
   at, it might show up higher in your feed.

   Updates to Real-Time Signals

   When ranking feed to determine the relevance of a post, we always look
   at real-time signals, such as whether a friend has just commented on
   it. We continue to improve News Feed to evaluate the importance of
   different signals at different times.

   With today’s update, we will now take into account how signals change
   in real time. So now if there is a lot of engagement from many people
   on Facebook about a topic, or if a post from a Page is getting a lot of
   engagement, we can understand in real-time that the topic or Page post
   might be temporarily more important to you, so we should show that
   content higher in your feed.

   For example, if your favorite soccer team just won a game, we might
   show you posts about the game higher up in News Feed because people are
   talking about it more broadly on Facebook.

   Will This Impact My Page?

   We anticipate that most Pages won’t see any significant changes to
   their distribution in News Feed. Some Pages might see a small increase
   in referral traffic or outbound clicks, and some Pages might see minor
   decreases. Pages should continue to post stories that are relevant to
   their audiences.

Updating How We Account For Video Completion Rates

   By Abhishek Bapna, Product Manager, and Seyoung Park, Research
   Scientist

   As with all kinds of content on Facebook, we’re continuing to improve
   how News Feed surfaces the most relevant videos for you. In the past,
   we’ve made updates to News Feed that take into account more of the
   actions that you take on videos and whether a video is live or not. We
   look at a range of signals when determining which videos to surface to
   you in News Feed, including how long a video is watched, whether people
   choose to turn on sound, and if people open the video in full screen.

   Today, we’re announcing a change to the way we rank videos in News Feed
   to adjust the value we give to how much of a video is watched. One of
   the signals we look at is “percent completion” — the percent of each
   video you watch — to help us understand which videos you enjoyed. If
   you watch most or all of a video, that tells us that you found the
   video to be compelling — and we know that completing a longer video is
   a bigger commitment than completing a shorter one. As we continue to
   understand how our community consumes video, we’ve realized that we
   should therefore weight percent completion more heavily the longer a
   video is, to avoid penalizing longer videos.

   Will This Impact My Page?

   While we expect that most Pages will not see significant changes in
   distribution as a result of this update, longer videos that people
   spend time watching may see a slight increase in distribution on
   Facebook — so people who find longer videos engaging may be able to
   discover more of them in News Feed. As a side effect, some shorter
   videos may see a slight dip in News Feed distribution.

   As always, Pages should focus on creating videos that are relevant and
   engaging to their audiences. Longer videos that people don’t want to
   watch will not perform better in News Feed. The best length for a video
   is whatever length is required to tell a compelling story that engages
   people, which is likely to vary depending on the story you’re telling.
   You also should look at your video insights in Page Analytics to
   understand how your videos perform.

   This change will roll out gradually over the coming weeks. As usual,
   we’ll continue to make improvements as we better understand video
   behavior on Facebook, to make sure that people are seeing the most
   engaging and relevant video content for them.

   Update on January 27, 2017 for clarity: This change applies only to
   organic videos and will not affect video ad distribution.

Introducing Watch, a New Platform For Shows On Facebook

   By Daniel Danker, Director of Product

   Update on 8/31: Over the next few days, Watch will be broadly available
   to people in the U.S. We’re excited to see how the community engages
   with shows – there will be hundreds to choose from — and we look
   forward to bringing the experience to more people in the future.

   Watching video on Facebook has the incredible power to connect people,
   spark conversation, and foster community. On Facebook, videos are
   discovered through friends and bring communities together. As more and
   more people enjoy this experience, we’ve learned that people like the
   serendipity of discovering videos in News Feed, but they also want a
   dedicated place they can go to watch videos. That’s why last year we
   launched the Video tab in the US, which offered a predictable place to
   find videos on Facebook. Now we want to make it even easier to catch up
   with shows you love.

Introducing Watch

   We’re introducing Watch, a new platform for shows on Facebook. Watch
   will be available on mobile, on desktop and laptop, and in our TV apps.
   Shows are made up of episodes — live or recorded — and follow a theme
   or storyline. To help you keep up with the shows you follow, Watch has
   a Watchlist so you never miss out on the latest episodes.

   Watch is personalized to help you discover new shows, organized around
   what your friends and communities are watching. For example, you’ll
   find sections like “Most Talked About,” which highlights shows that
   spark conversation, “What’s Making People Laugh,” which includes shows
   where many people have used the Haha reaction, and “What Friends Are
   Watching,” which helps you connect with friends about shows they too
   are following.

   We’ve learned from Facebook Live that people’s comments and reactions
   to a video are often as much a part of the experience as the video
   itself. So when you watch a show, you can see comments and connect with
   friends and other viewers while watching, or participate in a dedicated
   Facebook Group for the show.

A Platform for Shows

   Watch is a platform for all creators and publishers to find an
   audience, build a community of passionate fans, and earn money for
   their work. We think a wide variety of Facebook shows can be
   successful, particularly:
     * Shows that engage fans and community. Nas Daily publishes a daily
       show where he makes videos together with his fans from around the
       world. The Watchlist makes it easy for fans to catch every day’s
       new episode.
     * Live shows that connect directly with fans. Gabby Bernstein, a New
       York Times bestselling author, motivational speaker, and life
       coach, uses a combination of recorded and live episodes to connect
       with her fans and answer questions in real time.
     * Shows that follow a narrative arc or have a consistent theme.
       Tastemade’s Kitchen Little is a funny show about kids who watch a
       how-to video of a recipe, then instruct professional chefs on how
       to make it. Each episode features a new child, a new chef, and a
       new recipe. Unsurprisingly, the food doesn’t always turn out as
       expected.
     * Live events that bring communities together. Major League Baseball
       is broadcasting a game a week on Facebook, enabling people to watch
       live baseball while connecting with friends and fellow fans on the
       platform.

   We think Watch will be home to a wide range of shows, from reality to
   comedy to live sports. To help inspire creators and seed the ecosystem,
   we’ve also funded some shows that are examples of community-oriented
   and episodic video series. For example, Returning the Favor is a series
   hosted by Mike Rowe where he finds people doing something extraordinary
   for their community, tells the world about it, and in turn does
   something extraordinary for them. Candidates are nominated by Mike’s
   fans on Facebook.

   We’re excited to see how creators and publishers use shows to connect
   with their fans and community. You can learn more about making shows on
   our Media blog.

   We’ll be introducing Watch to a limited group of people in the US and
   plan to bring the experience to more people soon. Similarly, we’ll be
   opening up shows to a limited group of creators and plan to roll out to
   all soon.

Suspending Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group From Facebook

   By Paul Grewal, VP & Deputy General Counsel

   Update on March 17, 2018, 9:50 AM PT: The claim that this is a data
   breach is completely false. Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access
   to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone
   involved gave their consent. People knowingly provided their
   information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive
   pieces of information were stolen or hacked.

   Originally published on March 16, 2018:
   We are suspending Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), including
   their political data analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica, from
   Facebook. Given the public prominence of this organization, we want to
   take a moment to explain how we came to this decision and why.

   We Maintain Strict Standards and Policies

   Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,
   and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. In
   2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of
   Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our
   Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook
   Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political,
   government and military work around the globe. He also passed that data
   to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.

   Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to
   information from people after they chose to download his app. His app,
   “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed
   itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.”
   Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave
   their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set
   on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited
   information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow
   it.

   Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way
   and through the proper channels that governed all developers on
   Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules. By
   passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge
   Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our
   platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we
   removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan
   and all parties he had given data to that the information had been
   destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us
   that they destroyed the data.

   Breaking the Rules Leads to Suspension

   Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the
   certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving
   aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this
   is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they
   made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from
   Facebook, pending further information.

   We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect
   people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see
   that this happens. We will take legal action if necessary to hold them
   responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.

   How Things Have Changed

   We are constantly working to improve the safety and experience of
   everyone on Facebook. In the past five years, we have made significant
   improvements in our ability to detect and prevent violations by app
   developers. Now all apps requesting detailed user information go
   through our App Review process, which requires developers to justify
   the data they’re looking to collect and how they’re going to use it –
   before they’re allowed to even ask people for it.

   In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an
   update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to
   share about themselves, including their friend list. This is just one
   of the many ways we give people the tools to control their experience.
   Before you decide to use an app, you can review the permissions the
   developer is requesting and choose which information to share. You can
   manage or revoke those permissions at any time.

   On an ongoing basis, we also do a variety of manual and automated
   checks to ensure compliance with our policies and a positive experience
   for users. These include steps such as random audits of existing apps
   along with the regular and proactive monitoring of the fastest growing
   apps.

   We enforce our policies in a variety of ways — from working with
   developers to fix the problem, to suspending developers from our
   platform, to pursuing litigation.
