   Before downloading, installing, accessing or using the micron
   technology, inc. ("MTI") system scanner software ("software") or
   clicking on "accept", please carefully read this on-line system scanner
   software license agreement ("agreement") which contains the terms and
   conditions under which you ("licensee") are acquiring a license to use
   the software. If licensee does not accept the terms and conditions of
   this agreement, please do not download, install, access or use the

   installs, accesses or uses the software or clicks on "accept", licensee
   will be acquiring a license to use the software in object code form
   only in accordance with the terms and conditions of this agreement, and
   licensee will be considered to have accepted and agreed to all the
   terms and conditions of this agreement.

   1. License
   MTI grants to Licensee during the term of this Agreement a
   non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable and restricted license to
   use internally the Software strictly for the purposes of determining
   possible memory upgrades to Licensee's personal computer. No resale,
   relicensing, export, re-export or other redistribution of the Software
   in any way is permitted. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that it is
   solely responsible for the provision, maintenance and operation of all
   software (including without limitation all operating systems, web
   browsers, and network software), hardware, firmware, computer and
   telecommunications equipment and services, and all other third party
   products, materials and services necessary or useful for the proper
   download, installation, operation, access and/or use of the Software,
   and for paying any and all fees, costs and expenses associated with any
   and all of the foregoing.

   2. Ownership
   All right, title and interest in and to the Software, including without
   limitation all patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and all other
   proprietary and intellectual property rights, shall at all times remain
   with MTI (or its licensors). Licensee acknowledges and agrees that no
   ownership interest in or to the Software is transferred to Licensee
   hereunder, and that the Software is provided to Licensee during the
   term of this Agreement only and strictly on a license basis as provided
   for within this Agreement. MTI (or its licensors) reserves all rights
   not expressly granted.

   3. Permitted Uses
   a) Licensee may:
    i. download, install and use one (1) copy of the Software on one (1)
       personal computer of Licensee; and
   ii. make one (1) additional copy of the Software in machine readable
       format for backup purposes only.

   b) Licensee is prohibited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
   law from doing any of the following:
    i. sublicense, sublease, lease, sell, distribute, rent, permit
       concurrent use of or grant other rights in the Software;
   ii. provide use of the Software in a computer service business,
       network, time sharing or interactive cable television arrangement;
   iii. transfer or assign this Agreement; or
   iv. translate, copy, modify, adapt, alter, reverse engineer, create
       derivative works, decompile or disassemble any part of the
       Software.

   4. No Warranties

   The software is provided "as is" and "as available" without any
   representations or warranties whatsoever. MTI does not represent or
   warrant that the software will be error-free, bug-free, uninterrupted,

   MTI expressly disclaims any and all representations and warranties,
   whether express or implied, oral or written, statutory or otherwise,
   including, but not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness
   for a particular purpose, non-infringement, title, and those arising
   from a course of dealing, usage, trade custom or practice. These
   disclaimers shall apply to the maximum extent permissable under
   applicable law.

   5. Limitation of Liability
   The entire risk as to the download, installation, access, use, results
   and performance of the software is assumed by licensee. MTI shall not
   be liable under any circumstances or any legal or equitable theory,
   whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or
   otherwise, for any lost revenue or profits, lost or damaged data or any
   other commercial or economic loss, or for any direct, indirect,
   incidental, consequential, exemplary, punitive or special damages
   whatsoever arising out of or relating to the software or to this
   agreement, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. These
   limitations shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential
   purpose of any limited remedy. Nothing in this agreement shall restrict
   MTI's liability in a manner which is expressly prohibited by applicable
   law.

   6. Term and Termination
   This Agreement is effective until terminated. Licensee may terminate
   this Agreement at any time by ceasing all use of the Software. This
   Agreement shall terminate immediately without notice from MTI if
