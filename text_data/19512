   I have been teaching 1st grade for 12 years. I. Love. It. Teaching and
   learning are two passions that I have. What a better way to learn from
    others than from blogging! There is no better feeling than knowing I
                           have inspired a child.

Grab my Button!

Back to School 2019

   Well this post is a tad bit late...we are ending our first quarter on
   Thursday!  However, I wanted to share some of the fun things we did to
   start the year.  They focus on classroom management and citizenship.
   They are some of my favorite activities of the year.  If you well into
   the swing of things, you can always pin and save these ideas for next
   year!  Lots of photos here!
   On the first day, I begin teaching procedures.  I only introduce about
   4-5 and try to keep them simple.  I go over them, model them, and have
   students model them both correctly and incorrectly.  I use my trusty
   "Procedures for the B.O.Y." checklist, which is a *freebie* that you
   can grab below.  Just click the cover.
   [Slide1.JPG]
   [original-4788670-1.jpg]
   We always do tons of art projects that coincide with picture books.  We
   read Elmer and made our own elephants.  Using our markers for the first
   time was a lot of fun!  This elephant cutout is from Teacher By The
   Beach.
   [Slide2.JPG]
   We take lots of Play-Doh breaks!  I highly recommend getting Play-Doh
   (or putting on your supply list like we do).  Play-Doh breaks are a
   God-send at the start of the year!!!!  Gives you a minute to rest and
   collect your thoughts.
   [Slide3.JPG]
   We read lots of back to school books.  We also do some Find-a-Friend
   activities.  They are great to get the kids up and moving!  The one
   shown below is in my Back to School Activities pack.
   [Slide4.JPG]
   [Slide6.JPG]
   We read First Day Jitters, drank "jitter juice" aka green Hawaiian
   Punch mixed with Sprite Zero, and did a little written response about
   our feelings prior to starting our first day of first grade.  Writing
   activity can be found in my Back to School Activities pack as well.
   [Slide7.JPG]
   [Slide8.JPG]
   [Slide9.JPG]
   Coloring time is never a bad thing the first week of school.  I put
   coloring pages out as morning work the first week of school.  It eases
   kids back into the routine or having to start their day with something
   academic.
   [Slide10.JPG]
   Morning Meeting kicks off the first day!  You can read all about how I
   run the meeting by clicking HERE.  It's such a great time for
   establishing rapport and building community!!!
   [Slide11.JPG]
   [Slide12.JPG]
   [Slide13.JPG]
   Mini-books are great for teaching procedures and rules at the start of
   the year (or when you need a refresher!).  We discussed and practiced
   hallway rules and made this mini book as an extension.  Grab it below.
   [Slide14.JPG]
   [Slide15.JPG]
   I also love using Ashley Hughes' visual direction cards at the start of
   the year.  So helpful, especially with mini-books!!!
   [Slide16.JPG]
   [original-3948569-1.jpg]
   We discuss playground expectations.  We use this sort and practice by
   taking an extra recess.  The kids follow up with a cut and paste.
   Manners on the Playground is a great book to go with this activity.
   The sort and cut/paste is found in my Back to School Activities pack.
   [Slide17.JPG]
   [Slide18.JPG]
   Back to School BINGO is fun!  Find this in my Back to School Activities
   pack, as well!
   [Slide19.JPG]
   More discussion and practice with the lunchroom.  Manners in the
   Cafeteria is a great book to read before doing this sort.  Sort found
   in my Back to School Activities pack.
   [Slide20.JPG]
   Chrysanthemum is a great read aloud for back to school!  We read this
   and do a craft.  We also have a discussion and do a little activity
   about how you can't take back unkind words.  Find the craft patterns in
   my Back to School activities pack.
   [Slide21.JPG]
   [Slide119.JPG]
   Yet another sort about classroom behavior.  Cut and paste to follow.
   Great activity!  Find it in my Back to School Activities pack.
   [Slide22.JPG]
   [Slide23.JPG]
   Some of my favorite BTS read aloud books that go with my activities:
   [Slide24.JPG]
   Bus Safety Week!  We practice outside on the buses, we watch a bus
   safety movie, and we do this bus safety mini-book.  Click below to grab
   it.  Great review before a field trip, as well!
   [Slide57.JPG]
   [original-3944638-1.jpg]
   Did the sort of this activity this year; no time to do the writing.
   Therefore, no photos of it!  Great little sort to remind kids when it's
   ok and not ok to talk.  Grab it in my Back to School Activities pack.
   [Slide126.JPG]
   Obsessed with The Recess Queen book!  So great for a discussion on
   friendship vs. bullying.  We did a favorite part extension and made a
   little Mean Jean of our own!  Grab the writing and craft patterns in my
   Back to School Activities pack.

   Just about everything shown in this post can be found by clicking the
   cover below.  It's a wonderful resource.  I love it and have heard from
   many about how much they love it, too!  Check it out and have a great
   week!!

Sunday 6 September 29

   [Saturday%2B6.jpg]
   Hi, everyone!  I'm back again for a Sunday 6.  This is a blog post
   containing 6 random things from my week!  Enjoy!
   [Slide7.JPG]
   Monday was the first day of Fall, so we did a few things, like this
   mini-book, anchor chart (kids came up with the ideas for that), and
   coloring page.  Click the cover to grab the mini-book!  The free
   coloring page was found on TpT.
   [Slide10.JPG]
   [original-2648323-1.jpg]
   [Slide11.JPG]
   [Slide12.JPG]
   [Slide6.JPG]
   Last week I discovered carrots and peanut butter!!!!!!!  It's seriously
   the most delicious combination ever.  How did I not know about this
   before???
   [Slide2.JPG]
   [Slide5.JPG]
   I got the most recent "Kindergarten Crate" in the mail on Thursday.  KC
   is a monthly box subscription full of a picture book, teacher gift(s),
   and lots of other, thematic goodies for incorporating some FUN into
   your classroom!  This boxes theme was bats and reading.  So many great
   activities were included.  I especially love the cvc word building
   activity.  Perfect little center.  If you'd like to check out the KC,
   you can click HERE.  They have boxes for Pre-K, K, and 1st.
   [Slide5.JPG]
   [Slide6.JPG]
   [Slide4.JPG]
    Morning Meeting has been going great!  The kids are so attentive and
   they love playing the games/activities at the end of the meeting.  Our
   favorites right now are "I Have, Who Has" and "Beanbag, Beanbag."  You
   can check out my MM resources by clicking the cover below.  Note: The
   "I Have, Who Has" games are part of a different pack, and I'll link
   them for you, as well.
   [Slide14.JPG]
   [Slide15.JPG]
   [original-4688139-1.jpg]
   [original-3183782-1.jpg]
   [Slide3.JPG]
   I treated myself to a mani on Saturday.  I get these about once a month
   or so.  I LOVE the hand massage part.  So good for my RA.  Well worth
   the money.
   [Slide7.JPG]
   [Slide2.JPG]
   I've been using these cvc flash cards in class as an early finisher
   activity.  The kids love practicing with them!  I also use them as a
   quick assessment.  A friend who is also using these right now sent me
   this photo (hi, Amy!).  You can check them out below.  I also have them
   in silent e.
