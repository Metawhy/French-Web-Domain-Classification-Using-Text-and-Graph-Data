Bucksense Ad Platform Privacy Policy

INTRODUCTION

   This Privacy Policy explains how Bucksense, Inc. ("Bucksense" or "us"
   or “we”) collects, uses, and shares information from and about you when
   you interact with a mobile application or website that displays
   Bucksense advertisements (“Bucksense Ad Platform”or “Platform” or
   “Service”).

   Bucksense serves advertisements to end users of various publishers
   (such as website operators or mobile app developers), via real-time
   marketplace platforms exchanges ("Exchanges") and/or such publishers.
   Those ads are provided by advertisers, who use Platform to serve their
   ads and manage the overall performance of their ad campaigns, including
   by using third party services that integrate with our Platform. When an
   end user receives or clicks on an ad, we might receive or collect some
   or all of the data provided below, whether from the end user's device,
   from the relevant Exchange/s, from third parties and/or publishers
   ("Data").

   We generally do not collect or use personal information about
   individual users through the Bucksense Service. When we say “Personal
   Information”, we mean individually identifiable information that would
   allow us to determine the actual identity of and/or directly contact a
   specific living person, such as an email address or telephone number.
   We collect personal information only when we are contacted directly by
   an individual through the our site and the individual voluntarily
   provides personal information to us, such as by submitting a question
   or registering to use the Bucksense Service. Bucksense does not collect
   Personal Information about consumers that receive advertiser offers
   through the Bucksense Service.

   You are not legally obligated to provide us any Data. If you do not
   want Platform to collect such Data, please follow the instructions
   below to Opt-Out.

   You can find a list of Bucksense’s partners here
   www.bucksense.com/about-us/#ourPartners

COLLECTION OF DATA

   The Bucksense Services collect information about your device and the
   ads that we deliver onto your device. This data, which is collected
   passively using various technologies may come from such sources as your
   web browser or the apps that you use. We also may obtain the precise
   location (e.g., lat/long coordinates) of your device and may use that
   information to deliver targeted ads. We may also combine the
   information collected across multiple sites and mobile apps in order to
   create interest segments that help us target future advertisements
   based upon those inferred interests. This practice is sometimes
   referred to as behavioral advertising or interest-based advertising. We
   use this information as part of the Bucksense Services to perform a
   variety of tasks, such as limiting the number of times a specific
   advertisement is presented to the same user (frequency capping),
   providing an advertisement to only certain types of users, or providing
   a report to a client on the number of its advertisements that were
   clicked. We may share this information with clients, vendors, and other
   companies that we conduct business with as permitted by law.

   When we present an ad on your device we might receive or collect some
   or all of the following:
     * Which application will present the ad
     * If you clicked the ad and when
     * IP address
     * User Agent
     * Carrier where applicable
     * General location (i.e. city or zipcode)
     * Android advertising ID or Apple advertising ID (IDFA) as applicable

   In operating the Bucksense Service we may use the following
   technologies:
     * Cookies are small data files containing a string of characters,
       such as unique browser identifiers. Cookies are stored on your
       computer or other device and act as unique tags that identify your
       browser. Bucksense or our Clients and Partners may deploy a cookie
       on your browser when you click on the ad banner. This technology
       may provide with information regarding your IP address, browser
       type, the web pages that you visit just before or after visiting a
       website, the web pages viewed, and the dates and times of your
       visits.
     * A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is
       an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages. When
       you access a web page with a pixel tag, the pixel tag may generate
       a generic notice of the visit, and permit us, or our Clients or
       Partners, to set or read cookies. Pixel tags are used in
       combination with cookies to track the activity on a website by a
       particular browser on a particular device. If you disable cookies,
       pixel tags simply detect a given website visit. We or our Clients
       and Partners, may use cookies to, for example, remember you, track
       trends, and collect information about how you use Clients’ or
       Partners’ websites or interact with advertising. We, and our
       Clients and Partners, use cookies to provide relevant content to
       you and replace non-relevant ads with ads that better match your
       interests.
     * Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs. We, or our Clients or Partners,
       may use mobile SDKs to collect information, such as Mobile IDs, and
       information related to how mobile devices and their users interact
       with our Bucksense ad services and those using our Bucksense ad
       services. The SDK is computer code that app developers can include
       in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and
       other related services to be implemented. Sometimes, we obtain data
       through other interfaces that deliver similar data to us, which are
       commonly referred to as APIs. We may use these technologies, for
       example, to analyze or measure certain advertising through apps and
       browsers based on information associated with your mobile device.If
       you would like to opt out from having ads tailored to you in this
       way on your mobile device, please follow the Opt-Out paragraph. Our
       clients or partners may use the above technologies (sometimes, in
       combination with each other or other data such as IP addresses or
       hashed or de-identified data files) to coordinate identifiers
       across platforms, browsers, or devices, in order to more
       efficiently analyze or target advertising.

   CHILDREN: We do not knowingly or intentionally collect any Data about
   children under the age of 16. If you believe that information about
   your child under the age of 16 may have been provided to Bucksense
   and/or collected by Platform, please contact us at
   privacy@bucksense.com.

HOW BUCKSENSE COLLECTS THE DATA

   The Data may be provided to us directly by you, by the relevant
   Exchange/s and/or by publishers.

   We may also receive device identifiers such as Apple’s IFA (Identifier
   for Advertisers), Google’s Advertising Identifier (AID), and/or similar
   information from other third parties – in order to serve ads on behalf
   of our advertisers to the end users specified in such information. The
   collection and use of such information by the respective third parties
   is governed by the privacy policies of such third parties and by
   applicable law. Our use of such information is governed by this privacy
   policy, and the end users' consent and preferences as conveyed to us by
   such end users, by publishers and by other third parties.

HOW BUCKSENSE USES AND MANTAIN THE DATA

   Bucksense uses the Data to provide end users with our advertisers'
   customized ads regarding content and/or apps, to enable our advertisers
   to analyze their ad campaigns and performance (including via their
   respective tools and partners), and in order to improve the overall
   quality of Bucksense's services.

HOW LONG BUCKSENSE KEEPS THE DATA

   Bucksense may retain and use the Data for up to 90 days following the
   collection and/or receipt thereof, in order to ensure the proper
   performance of its services, and to allow its advertisers to properly
   manage and analyze their ad campaigns via our Platform.

   In some cases we might retain certain Data for a longer period, as
   reasonably necessary to comply with an Opt-Out request and/or with any
   applicable laws, or if we believe in good faith that the Data might be
   necessary in the future for dispute resolution purposes.

   Bucksense may use non-personal aggregated information, including such
   that was derived from Data but anonymized or pseudonymized to remove
   its personally identifying characteristics ("Aggregated Data"),
   including for statistical purposes. Aggregated Data may be kept
   indefinitely.

   Bucksense will not sell, trade or rent Data, excluding Aggregated Data,
   to any third party unless we have the end user's prior consent.

HOW BUCKSENSE SHARING AND DISCLOSURE THE DATA

   However, Bucksense may provide the identity of an end user to third
   parties and/or disclose Data to third parties if it believes in good
   faith that such identification or disclosure are necessary to:
    a. facilitate compliance with any law regulation or other governmental
       authority, including, for example, compliance with a court order or
       subpoena, or
    b. protect the safety or security of any person or property, including
       Platform, or
    c. protect Bucksense's legitimate interests in any legal or other
       disputes.

   Bucksense may also disclose the Data:
    a. third parties helping to provide and maintain Platform;
    b. the relevant advertiser(s);
    c. upon a transfer or sale to another entity of all or substantially
       all of Bucksense’s stock or assets; (d) upon any bankruptcy or
       other corporate reorganization.

   Bucksense may also share Data with its service providers, such as cloud
   hosting providers and data security and fraud prevention services, in
   order to properly facilitate and provide Platform.

ADS, APPS AND OTHER THIRD PARTY CONTENT

   Our Platform and ads served via our Platform may provide links to
   certain third party websites or referrals to certain third parties'
   products or services. If you choose to visit a third party's website or
   use its products or services, please be aware that Bucksense does not
   endorse and cannot ensure that you will be satisfied with any such
   products or services, and that the third party's privacy policy will
   govern your activities and any Data they collect about you and/or you
   disclose while interacting with such third party.

   This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites, ads, applications or
   services other than our Platform, even if Bucksense's services are
   embedded/linked in/to such, or to websites, ads, apps or services that
   are not expressly and officially provided by Bucksense. Please be aware
   that opting out of our Platform does not necessarily imply that you are
   opting out of any publisher's website, ad hosting app/website or any
   other third party's website and/or services.

CHOICE/OPT-OUT

   you with interest-based ads based on your inferred interests,
   preferences and location.
     * On your browser: If you prefer not to receive ads that are tailored
       to your interests, you can opt out of the Bucksense Ad Platform

       clicking here:
       OPT-OUT (http://options.bucksense.com/opt-out/)

       to be repeated if cookies are cleared on your browser (which can
       happen if you clear your browsing history or re-install your
       browser).
     * On your mobile device: You can also usually opt out of the receipt
       of all in-app interest-based ads by using your device’s privacy
       settings. Each operating system (e.g., iOS, Android) provides its
       own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of such in-app ads:

            materials and/or the privacy settings for your device’s
            operating system in order to opt-out of interest-based in-app
            ads.

   information for interest-based advertising you may still receive
   “generic” ads from us that are not based on your inferred interests.
