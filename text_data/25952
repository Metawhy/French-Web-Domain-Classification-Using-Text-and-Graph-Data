   Why Airbnb Reviews Don't Tell the Whole Story

Travelers who find themselves staying in the Airbnb from hell often don't
realize it until it's too late to get a refund.

   On Monday, journalist Nathaniel Friedman unleashed a tweetstorm about
   his girlfriend's bad experience as an Airbnb guest. She and two other
   friends needed a place to stay at the last minute, and all the local
   hotels were booked, in Friedman's retelling. Since they were desperate,
   they looked past the bad reviews and rented "what was supposed to be a
   secure trailer" for $270 per night. Upon arriving, they discovered that
   the amenities were even worse than they expected.

   "House was meth-y as f*** with garbage and graffiti everywhere,"
   Friedman wrote. The lock was broken, so the guests resorted to using a
   wrench to secure the door. There was no running water. To add insult to
   injury, "At 8AM, host woke them up by pounding on the door. He demanded
   they write a positive review NOW."

   Once she got home, Friedman's girlfriend tried to get a refund. "She
   was told by @Airbnb that the host's strict cancellation policy
   prohibited one," Friedman tweeted. When she pressed the issue, Airbnb
   offered to refund half of the cost, and then rescinded that offer. On
   Tuesday, the day after Friedman's initial tweetstorm, he added,
   "Yesterday @Airbnb indicated via Twitter that they'd be in touch. At
   1AM they issued a full refund (fees & all) with no explanation."

   Airbnb head of trust and risk-management Nick Shapiro told Inc., "These
   types of [negative] experiences are extremely rare." Seventy-five
   percent of Airbnb users post reviews, and upward of 90 percent of those
   reviews are positive. "We've refunded the guest and removed this
   listing," Shapiro said. "We are very sorry this experience did not go
   well. We want all of our users to have positive experiences. If anyone
   shows up at a home and it's not as advertised, we ask that they reach
   out to us, and we will refund or rebook them."

   An unsanitary, unsafe dwelling, a misleading listing, a dodgy host --
   why isn't a refund easier to come by in such a circumstance? Airbnb's
   website says that to be eligible for a refund, you must contact the
   company "within 24 hours of check-in" and include photos documenting
   the issues.

   In a direct message, Friedman explained that his girlfriend didn't get
   in touch with Airbnb immediately because the trailer was her only
   option for the night. "I get that she could've done more on her end,"
   he said, "but there were lots of extenuating circumstances, and every
   reason to believe (based on reviews) that the place would at least be
   passable."

   Airbnb shared snippets from a few of the listing's bad reviews:
     * "Pretty bad experience. Our room didn't have any lights, nor did it
       have a pillow on the bed. [...] The backyard was torn apart and
       very dirty."
     * "I would not stay here. Look at other places."
     * "A lot of information should be added [about] the amenities, or
       lack thereof."

   Friedman told Inc., "The bottom line is that [Airbnb] allowed someone
   to rent an unsafe property and then per usual gave full benefit of the
   doubt to the host." In a public tweet, he said, "This is a friendly
   reminder that AirBnB wants to avoid responsibility at any cost and you
   can't count on them to ensure your safety."

   Friedman's girlfriend isn't alone in being dissatisfied by the
   company's response after a terrible experience. In 2015, Zak Stone
   wrote about his father's accidental death at an Airbnb. "When my father
   decided to give [a rope swing] a try on Thanksgiving morning, the trunk
   it was tied to broke in half and fell on his head, immediately ending
   most of his brain activity," Stone said. "Hotel rooms are standardized
   for safety, monitored by staff, and often quite expensive. Airbnb
   rentals, on the other hand, are unregulated, eclectic, and affordable,
   and the safety standards are only slowly materializing."

   He added, "Of course, were Airbnb to invest in safety requirements by
   offering home inspections or by analyzing photo content to target
   higher-risk properties and features (pools, saunas, trampolines, etc.)
   with site-specific safety recommendations, such a program could be far
   more costly, and might jeopardize Airbnb's covetable neutrality as a
   platform," as well as its ability to relegate legal liability to Airbnb
   hosts.

   At least two Inc. staffers have had Airbnb experiences negative enough
   to seek remediation. Assistant editor Cameron Albert-Deitch stayed with
   a paranoid, emotionally abusive host, and wasn't able to get a refund
   because the host's personality wasn't evident until after the grace
   period ended. "Airbnb basically told me I was screwed on that count,"
   he said. "They were great, though, when the host posted an over-the-top
   slanderous review of me. I reported it and they took it down pretty
   much instantly."

   San Francisco bureau chief Jeff Bercovici stayed in a house where
   maggots were dropping from the ceiling of the kitchen as a result of a
   dead animal. While promising a refund, the host requested that Jeff not
   leave a negative review.

   Although the request runs counter to Airbnb's policy, he granted it.
   "Look, if you're a host and someone puts the word 'maggot' in a review,
   you're done. We felt sympathy," he explained. (It goes without saying
   that the host who demanded Friedman's girlfriend write a glowing review
   was also breaking the rules.)

   But the interaction illustrated how some of the host-guest dynamics on
   Airbnb can result in reviews that are incomplete or misleading -- the
   kind of reviews that can lead to a scary night in a trailer that feels
   like a meth den.

   "The same real-name policy that causes people to trust Airbnb's reviews
   in the first place is what makes people reluctant to leave a terrible
   review," Jeff said. Whereas the anonymity on platforms like Yelp can
   lead to extreme rants and ax-grinding, on Airbnb, the pattern is
   inverted: "Everyone is incentivized to say only nice things."

   Seth Porges, a tech writer and Airbnb super-host, blogged that guests
   who leave negative reviews that seem unreasonable can expect to be
   rejected by future hosts. "Sure, the reviews left for guests by past
   hosts are important, but the dirty little secret is that they aren't
   nearly as important as the reviews you yourself have left on hosts
   you've stayed with. Hosts live in constant fear of the dreaded Bad
   Review. So you better believe we check what reviews a guest has left
   for previous hosts they've stayed with."

   Airbnb disputes the notion that guests feel pressure to provide only
   positive feedback. The company says that both guests and hosts take
   reviews very seriously, not least because they use reviews to make
   their own decisions about where to stay or whom to accept into their
   home.

   The World's Most Successful People Don't Actually Start Work at 4 a.m.

Strategy

   The World's Most Successful People Don't Actually Start Work at 4 a.m.
   They Wake and Work Whenever the (Heck) They Decide

Waking up at an arbitrary time won't help you succeed. Making a thoughtful
decision to wake up at the time that's most productive for YOU is all that
matters.

   Apple CEO Tim Cook starts his morning routine -- not just his morning,
   his morning routine -- at 3:45. General Motors CEO Mary Barra gets to
   the office by 6 a.m. Best-selling author Dan Brown (The Da Vinci Code,
   etc.) gets up at 4 a.m., has a smoothie and a cup of bulletproof
   coffee, and then grinds away.

   Clearly, waking up early works for them.

   But not for everyone.

   As Adam Grant says, "The world's most successful people aren't worried
   about what time others wake up. They wake and work on the schedule that
   works for them."

     -- Adam Grant (@AdamMGrant) December 17, 2018

   What seems right for early birds may not be right for you, because what
   time you start your day has nothing to do with your level of success.

   Success is all about what you accomplish -- and, just as important, how
   you choose to accomplish it.

Early Birds

   Most people who choose to get up early do so because they can take
   advantage of a few hours of solitude. Fewer interruptions. Fewer
   emails. Fewer phone calls. Starting work earlier than everyone else
   lets you be proactive, not reactive, and lets you set the agenda for
   the day instead of having one set for you.

   Others choose to get up early so they make sure they get their workout
   in -- and take advantage of the mood-boosting effect of exercise.
   (Research shows that as little as 20 minutes of moderate exercise
   boosts your mood for the next 12 hours.)

   Or maybe they just get up early because The Wall Street Journal says
   that 4 a.m. may be the most productive time of the day.

Later Birds

   If you decide to start your workday at, say, 9 a.m., you can still
   structure your day in the most productive way possible for you.
   Simply create a routine that allows you to hit the ground running the
   way you want to run.

   Maybe that means locking yourself away for a couple of hours. Maybe
   that means working from home, and then heading to the office. Or maybe
   that means shifting your quiet hours to the evening. No one says you
   have to start work before everyone else -- you can just as easily
   finish work after everyone else.

   Maybe that means training everyone around you to understand that the
   first two hours are your hours.

   While that might sound impossible, don't forget that everything you do
   "trains" people to treat you a certain way. Let employees interrupt
   your meetings or phone calls whenever they like, and people will
   naturally do so. Drop what you're doing every time someone calls, and
   people will naturally always expect your immediate attention. Return
   emails immediately, and people will naturally expect you to immediately
   respond.

   How you act -- and react -- "trains" people to treat you the way they
   wish, so start "retraining" them so you can work the way you work best.

The Most Successful Birds

   When you start working doesn't matter. When you stop working doesn't
   matter.

   What matters is what you accomplish during the hours you work -- and
   that means making an intentional decision about what time you get up
   and what time you start work.

   Don't get up at a certain time just because Tim Cook does. Don't start
   work at a certain time just because Sallie Krawcheck does.

   Figure out what works best for you.

   Success has nothing to do with what time you start. Or what time you
   finish. Success is all about what you accomplish.

   Make a conscious decision about what time to get up. Not a reflexive
   choice or a copycat choice but a thoughtful, smart, and logical
   decision -- based on what will make you most successful.

   Because that's all that matters.

   Warren Buffett Looks for Intelligence and Initiative When Hiring
   People. But Without This Third Trait, 'the First Two Will Kill You'

Do you ever base your hiring decisions on this? You should.

   Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway

   Billionaire Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway,
   still captures the world's attention with his wisdom, even at the
   youthful age of 88.

   Buffett's commonsense wisdom stretches far beyond wealth and investment
   to decisions that could make or break your very livelihood, or the
   livelihood of your organization.

   Like, for example, a company's hiring decisions. In respect to this
   topic, the mega-mogul said:

     We look for three things when we hire people. We look for
     intelligence, we look for initiative or energy, and we look for
     integrity. And if they don't have the latter, the first two will
     kill you, because if you're going to get someone without integrity,
     you want them lazy and dumb.

   So, who wants to hire a dumb and lazy person, raise your hand?
   Integrity is a personal value that should be explored in-depth but is
   often overlooked in interviews, which can be costly later, especially
   in the upper levels of a company's hierarchy.

Why integrity is so crucial for success.

   When we arrive at the difficult crossroads of life, even the smallest
   action can ruin your reputation and trigger an avalanche of unfortunate
   incidents that may be out of your control.

   That's when integrity shows its best side. As the famous saying goes,
   we act with integrity by always doing the right thing, even when no one
   is looking, and especially when the choice isn't easy.

   I'll close with seven reasons why you should consider making your most
   important decisions at work with integrity, and, more important, why
   you should always bank on hiring people with integrity to take your
   company to the next level.

1. You don't question yourself; other people don't question you.

   Life is simplified and more peaceful when you do the right thing and
   speak in honesty and truth. And when you back up your words with
   actions that are consistent, and your actions are open for everyone to
   see, people don't question whether you're hiding anything.

2. You gain trust.

   Integrity leads to trust. People working closest to you experience you
   as dependable and accountable for your actions. Trust develops, people
   feel safe in your presence, and you gain influence.

3. You command respect.

   Integrity is a hallmark of ethical leadership. And when you demonstrate
   integrity, others will naturally respond to your ethical leadership
   with great respect.

4. You give and keep promises.

   People with integrity give promises, even reluctantly. But once they
   do, they always follow through on that promise without fail.

5. You don't cheat.

   Remember Enron? That company was once called one of the most innovative
   in the country. But their CEO and top management team decided to
   build their success on a foundation of lies and deception. You know how
   that story ended.

6. You don't betray others.

   People who act in integrity don't betray themselves or others by using
   words or making decisions not aligned with who they truly are. It's
   highly unlikely that you will hear such a person being talked about for
   "throwing someone under the bus."

7. You're given more responsibilities.

   Because a person of integrity is responsible (and does the right
   thing), managers will give them higher levels of responsibilities,
   which can increase skills and advance careers.

   He Drank 47 Cups of Coffee a Day and What Happened Was Beyond Amazing

   He Drank 47 Cups of Coffee a Day and What Happened Was Beyond Amazing

Extreme caffeination is not for everybody, but it definitely worked well for
this guy.

   [G_James_updated_headshot_51669.png] By Geoffrey JamesContributing

   [getty_938993594_401542.jpg]

   Ever wonder what would happen if you drank WAY more coffee than you do
   today? Well, it turns out there's this guy who drank the equivalent of
   around 47 cups a day (Americano) for almost 25 years. That's about six
   gallons a day, or cumulatively enough coffee to fill an Olympic-size
   swimming pool.

   Since consuming six gallons a day of any liquid would kill you, he
   drank his coffee in the form of super-strong espresso, thus
   significantly cutting down the volume but not the potency. (He also
   chewed raw coffee grounds when he needed an extra energy burst.)

   Now, you'd think that anybody consuming such an insane amount of coffee
   would get the jitters to the point that they'd be walking around on the
   ceiling like a gecko. What actually happened, though, was far more
   amazing.

   While on world's hugest coffee buzz, Honore de Balzac wrote 47 novels,
   12 novellas, 18 short stories, and 8 plays. Balzac also created the
   world's first continuing series with character crossovers--the model
   for all genre fiction. You think Stan Lee created a lot of heroes and
   villains? Well, Balzac invented and juggled 2,472 named characters.

   Even more amazingly, Balzac created this mass of intellectual property
   without using a computer or even a typewriter. Or even a sharpie. No,
   that huge creative output came out of a hand-cut quill pen. And the
   writing wasn't fluff. Quite the contrary, Balzac is widely considered
   the most influential novelist of all time.

   So, we'd all like to be that creative, right? Well, before you order 12
   espresso machines on Amazon, be forewarned that--despite the salutary
   effect it apparently had on Balzac-- drinking that much coffee is
   really bad idea. While you probably wouldn't get caffeine poisoning,
   you'd definitely end up with sleep problems and probably some kind of
   nervous exhaustion.

   On the other hand, you might want to step up your game a bit. According
   to multiple studies, you get the greatest benefit from coffee if you
   drink between six and eight cups a day, or roughly a quart of brewed
   Americano. So most people, sadly, probably aren't drinking enough.
   Bottoms up!

   Why Airbnb Reviews Don't Tell the Whole Story

Travelers who find themselves staying in the Airbnb from hell often don't
realize it until it's too late to get a refund.

   [sonya-headshot_152791.jpg] By Sonya MannStaff reporter,

   On Monday, journalist Nathaniel Friedman unleashed a tweetstorm about
   his girlfriend's bad experience as an Airbnb guest. She and two other
   friends needed a place to stay at the last minute, and all the local
   hotels were booked, in Friedman's retelling. Since they were desperate,
   they looked past the bad reviews and rented "what was supposed to be a
   secure trailer" for $270 per night. Upon arriving, they discovered that
   the amenities were even worse than they expected.

   "House was meth-y as f*** with garbage and graffiti everywhere,"
   Friedman wrote. The lock was broken, so the guests resorted to using a
   wrench to secure the door. There was no running water. To add insult to
   injury, "At 8AM, host woke them up by pounding on the door. He demanded
   they write a positive review NOW."

   Once she got home, Friedman's girlfriend tried to get a refund. "She
   was told by @Airbnb that the host's strict cancellation policy
   prohibited one," Friedman tweeted. When she pressed the issue, Airbnb
   offered to refund half of the cost, and then rescinded that offer. On
   Tuesday, the day after Friedman's initial tweetstorm, he added,
   "Yesterday @Airbnb indicated via Twitter that they'd be in touch. At
   1AM they issued a full refund (fees & all) with no explanation."

   Airbnb head of trust and risk-management Nick Shapiro told Inc., "These
   types of [negative] experiences are extremely rare." Seventy-five
   percent of Airbnb users post reviews, and upward of 90 percent of those
   reviews are positive. "We've refunded the guest and removed this
   listing," Shapiro said. "We are very sorry this experience did not go
   well. We want all of our users to have positive experiences. If anyone
   shows up at a home and it's not as advertised, we ask that they reach
   out to us, and we will refund or rebook them."

   An unsanitary, unsafe dwelling, a misleading listing, a dodgy host --
   why isn't a refund easier to come by in such a circumstance? Airbnb's
   website says that to be eligible for a refund, you must contact the
   company "within 24 hours of check-in" and include photos documenting
   the issues.

   In a direct message, Friedman explained that his girlfriend didn't get
   in touch with Airbnb immediately because the trailer was her only
   option for the night. "I get that she could've done more on her end,"
   he said, "but there were lots of extenuating circumstances, and every
   reason to believe (based on reviews) that the place would at least be
   passable."

   Airbnb shared snippets from a few of the listing's bad reviews:
     * "Pretty bad experience. Our room didn't have any lights, nor did it
       have a pillow on the bed. [...] The backyard was torn apart and
       very dirty."
     * "I would not stay here. Look at other places."
     * "A lot of information should be added [about] the amenities, or
       lack thereof."

   Friedman told Inc., "The bottom line is that [Airbnb] allowed someone
   to rent an unsafe property and then per usual gave full benefit of the
   doubt to the host." In a public tweet, he said, "This is a friendly
   reminder that AirBnB wants to avoid responsibility at any cost and you
   can't count on them to ensure your safety."

   Friedman's girlfriend isn't alone in being dissatisfied by the
   company's response after a terrible experience. In 2015, Zak Stone
   wrote about his father's accidental death at an Airbnb. "When my father
   decided to give [a rope swing] a try on Thanksgiving morning, the trunk
   it was tied to broke in half and fell on his head, immediately ending
   most of his brain activity," Stone said. "Hotel rooms are standardized
   for safety, monitored by staff, and often quite expensive. Airbnb
   rentals, on the other hand, are unregulated, eclectic, and affordable,
   and the safety standards are only slowly materializing."

   He added, "Of course, were Airbnb to invest in safety requirements by
   offering home inspections or by analyzing photo content to target
   higher-risk properties and features (pools, saunas, trampolines, etc.)
   with site-specific safety recommendations, such a program could be far
   more costly, and might jeopardize Airbnb's covetable neutrality as a
   platform," as well as its ability to relegate legal liability to Airbnb
   hosts.

   At least two Inc. staffers have had Airbnb experiences negative enough
   to seek remediation. Assistant editor Cameron Albert-Deitch stayed with
   a paranoid, emotionally abusive host, and wasn't able to get a refund
   because the host's personality wasn't evident until after the grace
   period ended. "Airbnb basically told me I was screwed on that count,"
   he said. "They were great, though, when the host posted an over-the-top
   slanderous review of me. I reported it and they took it down pretty
   much instantly."

   San Francisco bureau chief Jeff Bercovici stayed in a house where
   maggots were dropping from the ceiling of the kitchen as a result of a
   dead animal. While promising a refund, the host requested that Jeff not
   leave a negative review.

   Although the request runs counter to Airbnb's policy, he granted it.
   "Look, if you're a host and someone puts the word 'maggot' in a review,
   you're done. We felt sympathy," he explained. (It goes without saying
   that the host who demanded Friedman's girlfriend write a glowing review
   was also breaking the rules.)

   But the interaction illustrated how some of the host-guest dynamics on
   Airbnb can result in reviews that are incomplete or misleading -- the
   kind of reviews that can lead to a scary night in a trailer that feels
   like a meth den.

   "The same real-name policy that causes people to trust Airbnb's reviews
   in the first place is what makes people reluctant to leave a terrible
   review," Jeff said. Whereas the anonymity on platforms like Yelp can
   lead to extreme rants and ax-grinding, on Airbnb, the pattern is
   inverted: "Everyone is incentivized to say only nice things."

   Seth Porges, a tech writer and Airbnb super-host, blogged that guests
   who leave negative reviews that seem unreasonable can expect to be
   rejected by future hosts. "Sure, the reviews left for guests by past
   hosts are important, but the dirty little secret is that they aren't
   nearly as important as the reviews you yourself have left on hosts
   you've stayed with. Hosts live in constant fear of the dreaded Bad
   Review. So you better believe we check what reviews a guest has left
   for previous hosts they've stayed with."

   Airbnb disputes the notion that guests feel pressure to provide only
   positive feedback. The company says that both guests and hosts take
   reviews very seriously, not least because they use reviews to make
   their own decisions about where to stay or whom to accept into their
   home.

   The World's Most Successful People Don't Actually Start Work at 4 a.m.

Strategy

   The World's Most Successful People Don't Actually Start Work at 4 a.m.
   They Wake and Work Whenever the (Heck) They Decide

Waking up at an arbitrary time won't help you succeed. Making a thoughtful
decision to wake up at the time that's most productive for YOU is all that
matters.

   Apple CEO Tim Cook starts his morning routine -- not just his morning,
   his morning routine -- at 3:45. General Motors CEO Mary Barra gets to
   the office by 6 a.m. Best-selling author Dan Brown (The Da Vinci Code,
   etc.) gets up at 4 a.m., has a smoothie and a cup of bulletproof
   coffee, and then grinds away.

   Clearly, waking up early works for them.

   But not for everyone.

   As Adam Grant says, "The world's most successful people aren't worried
   about what time others wake up. They wake and work on the schedule that
   works for them."

     The world's most successful people aren't worried about what time

     them.#MondayMotivation https://t.co/imIheRpO7Q
     -- Adam Grant (@AdamMGrant) December 17, 2018

   What seems right for early birds may not be right for you, because what
   time you start your day has nothing to do with your level of success.

   Success is all about what you accomplish -- and, just as important, how
   you choose to accomplish it.

Early Birds

   Most people who choose to get up early do so because they can take
   advantage of a few hours of solitude. Fewer interruptions. Fewer
   emails. Fewer phone calls. Starting work earlier than everyone else
   lets you be proactive, not reactive, and lets you set the agenda for
   the day instead of having one set for you.

   Others choose to get up early so they make sure they get their workout
   in -- and take advantage of the mood-boosting effect of exercise.
   (Research shows that as little as 20 minutes of moderate exercise
   boosts your mood for the next 12 hours.)

   Or maybe they just get up early because The Wall Street Journal says
   that 4 a.m. may be the most productive time of the day.

Later Birds

   If you decide to start your workday at, say, 9 a.m., you can still
   structure your day in the most productive way possible for you.
   Simply create a routine that allows you to hit the ground running the
   way you want to run.

   Maybe that means locking yourself away for a couple of hours. Maybe
   that means working from home, and then heading to the office. Or maybe
   that means shifting your quiet hours to the evening. No one says you
   have to start work before everyone else -- you can just as easily
   finish work after everyone else.

   Maybe that means training everyone around you to understand that the
   first two hours are your hours.

   While that might sound impossible, don't forget that everything you do
   "trains" people to treat you a certain way. Let employees interrupt
   your meetings or phone calls whenever they like, and people will
   naturally do so. Drop what you're doing every time someone calls, and
   people will naturally always expect your immediate attention. Return
   emails immediately, and people will naturally expect you to immediately
   respond.

   How you act -- and react -- "trains" people to treat you the way they
   wish, so start "retraining" them so you can work the way you work best.

The Most Successful Birds

   When you start working doesn't matter. When you stop working doesn't
   matter.

   What matters is what you accomplish during the hours you work -- and
   that means making an intentional decision about what time you get up
   and what time you start work.

   Don't get up at a certain time just because Tim Cook does. Don't start
   work at a certain time just because Sallie Krawcheck does.

   Figure out what works best for you.

   Success has nothing to do with what time you start. Or what time you
   finish. Success is all about what you accomplish.

   Make a conscious decision about what time to get up. Not a reflexive
   choice or a copycat choice but a thoughtful, smart, and logical
   decision -- based on what will make you most successful.

   Because that's all that matters.

   Warren Buffett Looks for Intelligence and Initiative When Hiring
   People. But Without This Third Trait, 'the First Two Will Kill You'

Do you ever base your hiring decisions on this? You should.

   Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway
   Getty Images

   Billionaire Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway,
   still captures the world's attention with his wisdom, even at the
   youthful age of 88.

   Buffett's commonsense wisdom stretches far beyond wealth and investment
   to decisions that could make or break your very livelihood, or the
   livelihood of your organization.

   Like, for example, a company's hiring decisions. In respect to this
   topic, the mega-mogul said:

     We look for three things when we hire people. We look for
     intelligence, we look for initiative or energy, and we look for
     integrity. And if they don't have the latter, the first two will
     kill you, because if you're going to get someone without integrity,
     you want them lazy and dumb.

   So, who wants to hire a dumb and lazy person, raise your hand?
   Integrity is a personal value that should be explored in-depth but is
   often overlooked in interviews, which can be costly later, especially
   in the upper levels of a company's hierarchy.

Why integrity is so crucial for success.

   When we arrive at the difficult crossroads of life, even the smallest
   action can ruin your reputation and trigger an avalanche of unfortunate
   incidents that may be out of your control.

   That's when integrity shows its best side. As the famous saying goes,
   we act with integrity by always doing the right thing, even when no one
   is looking, and especially when the choice isn't easy.

   I'll close with seven reasons why you should consider making your most
   important decisions at work with integrity, and, more important, why
   you should always bank on hiring people with integrity to take your
   company to the next level.

1. You don't question yourself; other people don't question you.

   Life is simplified and more peaceful when you do the right thing and
   speak in honesty and truth. And when you back up your words with
   actions that are consistent, and your actions are open for everyone to
   see, people don't question whether you're hiding anything.

2. You gain trust.

   Integrity leads to trust. People working closest to you experience you
   as dependable and accountable for your actions. Trust develops, people
   feel safe in your presence, and you gain influence.

3. You command respect.

   Integrity is a hallmark of ethical leadership. And when you demonstrate
   integrity, others will naturally respond to your ethical leadership
   with great respect.

4. You give and keep promises.

   People with integrity give promises, even reluctantly. But once they
   do, they always follow through on that promise without fail.

5. You don't cheat.

   Remember Enron? That company was once called one of the most innovative
   in the country. But their CEO and top management team decided to
   build their success on a foundation of lies and deception. You know how
   that story ended.

6. You don't betray others.

   People who act in integrity don't betray themselves or others by using
   words or making decisions not aligned with who they truly are. It's
   highly unlikely that you will hear such a person being talked about for
   "throwing someone under the bus."

7. You're given more responsibilities.

   Because a person of integrity is responsible (and does the right
   thing), managers will give them higher levels of responsibilities,
   which can increase skills and advance careers.

   He Drank 47 Cups of Coffee a Day and What Happened Was Beyond Amazing

   He Drank 47 Cups of Coffee a Day and What Happened Was Beyond Amazing

Extreme caffeination is not for everybody, but it definitely worked well for
this guy.

   [G_James_updated_headshot_51669.png] By Geoffrey JamesContributing
   editor, Inc.com@Sales_Source
   [getty_938993594_401542.jpg]

   Ever wonder what would happen if you drank WAY more coffee than you do
   today? Well, it turns out there's this guy who drank the equivalent of
   around 47 cups a day (Americano) for almost 25 years. That's about six
   gallons a day, or cumulatively enough coffee to fill an Olympic-size
   swimming pool.

   Since consuming six gallons a day of any liquid would kill you, he
   drank his coffee in the form of super-strong espresso, thus
   significantly cutting down the volume but not the potency. (He also
   chewed raw coffee grounds when he needed an extra energy burst.)

   Now, you'd think that anybody consuming such an insane amount of coffee
   would get the jitters to the point that they'd be walking around on the
   ceiling like a gecko. What actually happened, though, was far more
   amazing.

   While on world's hugest coffee buzz, Honore de Balzac wrote 47 novels,
   12 novellas, 18 short stories, and 8 plays. Balzac also created the
   world's first continuing series with character crossovers--the model
   for all genre fiction. You think Stan Lee created a lot of heroes and
   villains? Well, Balzac invented and juggled 2,472 named characters.

   Even more amazingly, Balzac created this mass of intellectual property
   without using a computer or even a typewriter. Or even a sharpie. No,
   that huge creative output came out of a hand-cut quill pen. And the
   writing wasn't fluff. Quite the contrary, Balzac is widely considered
   the most influential novelist of all time.

   So, we'd all like to be that creative, right? Well, before you order 12
   espresso machines on Amazon, be forewarned that--despite the salutary
   effect it apparently had on Balzac-- drinking that much coffee is
   really bad idea. While you probably wouldn't get caffeine poisoning,
   you'd definitely end up with sleep problems and probably some kind of
   nervous exhaustion.

   On the other hand, you might want to step up your game a bit. According
   to multiple studies, you get the greatest benefit from coffee if you
   drink between six and eight cups a day, or roughly a quart of brewed
   Americano. So most people, sadly, probably aren't drinking enough.
   Bottoms up!

   This Chicago Duo Sold Their Protein Bar Company for $600 Million. 6
   Lessons You Can Take From Them

The story of Peter Rahal, co-founder of RXBAR

   [RobbieAbedauthorheadshot_253526.jpg] By Robbie AbedAuthor, writer, and
   founder of Firemeibegyou.com@robbieab
   [RXBAR-Founders_327798.jpg]
   RXBAR co-founders Jared Smith (left) and Peter Rahal.
   Courtesy Company

   "Have you ever had one of these RXBARs?" I asked the cashier as I was
   checking out.

   "I actually haven't, but man do they sell. People here love it and buy
   it all the time," the cashier said.

   I had just finished interviewing co-founder of   RXBAR, Peter Rahal at
   his local coffee shop in the River North neighborhood of Chicago.

   Three weeks prior, Rahal and his partner Jared Smith sold their company
   to Kellogg's for $600 million.

   No venture capital or outside funding--just $5,000 invested by each
   founder.

   The rest is history. Here's what I learned from Rahal.

You don't need investors to build a multimillion-dollar company

   "I remember distinctly early in my business when I was asking my dad
   about all the investor money I needed to fulfill my vision for RXBAR.
   He told me very directly, 'You need to shut up and sell 1,000 bars.'"

   That's all Rahal needed to hear. He started walking door to door to
   coffee shops and cross-fit centers in his neighborhood.

   "We would ask to speak to the owner and ask if we could put my bars on
   their shelves. we gave it away for free. We didn't care. We just wanted
   people to start trying them out. We made these bars by hand. There was
   no huge manufacturing line. It was one bar at a time.

   It actually made our due diligence with Kellogg really smooth. We had a
   clean cap table. We were open books with them. Everything they wanted
   to know, we had answers for them," Rahal said.

Iterate and learn

   The first RXBAR packaging was built in PowerPoint.

   "I'm not a designer, but Jared and I knew that we needed to get to
   market as soon as possible, so we opened up PowerPoint and created the
   best packaging we could. I even put my cell phone number on the
   package. I wanted to make sure I was accessible as possible. Feedback
   is how we grew," Rahal said. "We knew we were on to something pretty
   quickly. We went all-in [and] quit our day jobs. [We] moved our
   operations from mom's basement and rented a small production space."

   After 5 iterations of packaging:

Believe in what you're selling

   We were sick of all these weak ingredients in protein bars. That's when
   we decided to make something that was transparent. We knew the market
   wanted something like this. That's why we put our core ingredients on
   the package. It really is 'no B.S.'"

   One thing we say is, "We tell you what's on the inside on the
   outside."

   I have to say that's probably one of the best brand promises I've heard
   in a long time.

Embrace your differences

   "My partner Jared and I are very different. It's a big reason why he's
   been so crucial to the success of this business. I honestly don't think
   we would be in business if it wasn't for him. He enabled us to grow at
   the pace we are growing, without raising any capital."

   "We had manufacturing and distribution constraints, but we each played
   a role in solving problems."

   "These constraints helped us stay honest with ourselves," says Rahal.

Culture is everything

   "I don't have a corner office. I sit with everyone else. I actually
   take most of my calls on speakerphone. I want to set the tone that I
   have nothing to hide and that we're all in this together," Rahal said.

   He also implemented dynamic job descriptions for his employees.

   "Considering the growth we had in a short time frame, it's important
   that the roles of our team members change as we grow. Just because you
   are responsible for one thing when you got hired, doesn't mean that
   there aren't other roles you can grow into. I made sure that was clear
   from day one."

Just because you sold the company, doesn't mean your work is done

   "Some people might be surprised that I'm still working, but I love it.
   Also, you don't sell your company and have less work. That's not how
   this works! In many respects, we just got started. I still have a great
   job."

   "We picked [Kellogg's] as a partner, because we felt they really
   understood our business, our vision and most importantly, I learned
   something from them every conversation I had."

   Life is simplified and more peaceful when you do the right thing and
   speak in honesty and truth. And when you back up your words with
   actions that are consistent, and your actions are open for everyone to
   see, people don't question whether you're hiding anything.

2. You gain trust.

   Integrity leads to trust. People working closest to you experience you
   as dependable and accountable for your actions. Trust develops, people
   feel safe in your presence, and you gain influence.

3. You command respect.

   Integrity is a hallmark of ethical leadership. And when you demonstrate
   integrity, others will naturally respond to your ethical leadership
   with great respect.

4. You give and keep promises.

   People with integrity give promises, even reluctantly. But once they
   do, they always follow through on that promise without fail.

5. You don't cheat.

   Remember Enron? That company was once called one of the most innovative
   in the country. But their CEO and top management team decided to
   build their success on a foundation of lies and deception. You know how
   that story ended.

6. You don't betray others.

   People who act in integrity don't betray themselves or others by using
   words or making decisions not aligned with who they truly are. It's
   highly unlikely that you will hear such a person being talked about for
   "throwing someone under the bus."

7. You're given more responsibilities.

   Because a person of integrity is responsible (and does the right
   thing), managers will give them higher levels of responsibilities,
   which can increase skills and advance careers.
