Intel® Thermal Velocity Boost (Intel® TVB)

   Intel® Thermal Velocity Boost (Intel® TVB) is a new feature supported
   on Intel® Core™ i9-8950HK processor. It opportunistically and
   automatically increases clock frequency above single-core and
   multi-core Intel® Turbo Boost Technology 2.0 frequencies based on how
   much the processor is operating below its maximum temperature. The
   frequency gain and duration is dependent on the workload, capabilities
   of the processor and the processor cooling solution. For processors
   that have Intel® TVB enabled, the maximum Core Frequency is achieved
   while the processor is at a temperature of 50°C or lower and turbo
   power budget is available. Frequencies may reduce over time as
   processor temperature increases.

   Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions (Intel® AVX) are designed to achieve
   higher throughput to certain integer and floating-point operations. Due
   to varying processor power characteristics, utilizing AVX instructions
   may cause a) some parts to operate at less than the rated frequency and
   b) some parts with Intel® Turbo Boost Technology 2.0 to not achieve any
   or maximum turbo frequencies. Performance varies depending on hardware,
   software, and system configuration and you should consult your system
   manufacturer for more information. *Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions
   refers to Intel® AVX, Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 2 (Intel® AVX2)
   or Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel® AVX-512). For more
   information on Intel® Turbo Boost Technology 2.0, visit

Intel® Thermal Velocity Boost (Intel® TVB)

   Intel® Thermal Velocity Boost (Intel® TVB) is a new feature supported
   on Intel® Core™ i9-8950HK processor. It opportunistically and
   automatically increases clock frequency above single-core and
   multi-core Intel® Turbo Boost Technology 2.0 frequencies based on how
   much the processor is operating below its maximum temperature. The
   frequency gain and duration is dependent on the workload, capabilities
   of the processor and the processor cooling solution. For processors
   that have Intel® TVB enabled, the maximum Core Frequency is achieved
   while the processor is at a temperature of 50°C or lower and turbo
   power budget is available. Frequencies may reduce over time as
   processor temperature increases.

   software patches and firmware updates intended to address exploits
   referred to as "Spectre" and "Meltdown". Implementation of these
   updates may make these results inapplicable to your device or system.

   Software and workloads used in performance tests may have been
   optimized for performance only on Intel® microprocessors. Performance
   tests, such as SYSmark* and MobileMark*, are measured using specific
   computer systems, components, software, operations and functions. Any
   change to any of those factors may cause the results to vary. You
   should consult other information and performance tests to assist you in
   fully evaluating your contemplated purchases, including the performance
   of that product when combined with other products.For more complete
   information visit http://www.intel.com/benchmarks. The benchmark
   results reported above may need to be revised as additional testing is
   conducted. The results depend on the specific platform configurations
   and workloads utilized in the testing, and may not be applicable to any
   particular user’s components, computersystem or workloads. The results
   are not necessarily representative of other benchmarks and other
   benchmark results may show greater or lesser impact from mitigations.
