   5. Your rights

   We will only send you marketing communications if you “opted in” to
   receiving such communications. You have the right to “opt out” of
   receiving marketing communications, whether by email or otherwise, at
   any time. You can do this by (i) clicking the unsubscribe link
   displayed in any of the marketing e-mails you receive, (ii) emailing
   privacy@belmond.com to indicate you no longer wish to receive marketing
   communications, or (iii) writing to us at the address set out in How to
   contact us below.

   Pursuant to California's "Shine the Light Act", California residents
   are permitted to request information about the manner in which we share
   certain categories of data with third parties for their marketing use.

   If you are a “data subject” under applicable EU data protection law,
   you will have the following rights in relation to personal data that we
   hold about you:
     * Right to Access - to request confirmation of whether we process
       personal data relating to you, and if so, to request a copy of that
       personal data;
     * Right to Rectification - to request that we rectify or update any
       personal data that is inaccurate, incomplete or outdated;
     * Right to Erasure - to request that we erase your personal data in
       certain circumstances, such as where we collected personal data on
       the basis of your consent and you withdraw your consent;
     * Right to Restriction of Processing - to request that we restrict
       the use of your personal data in certain circumstances, such as
       while we consider another request that you have submitted, for
       example a request that we update your personal data;
     * Right to Withdraw Consent - where you have given us consent to
       process your personal data, to withdraw your consent; and
     * Right to Data Portability - to request that we provide a copy of
       your personal data to you in a structured, commonly used and
       machine readable format in certain circumstances.

   To exercise your rights as set out above or to make a complaint or
   submit an inquiry about our privacy practices, please contact us at

   6. Data transfers

   We may transfer to, and store the data we collect about you in,
   countries other than the country in which the data was originally
   collected, including the United States, Canada or other destinations
   outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Those countries may not
   have the same data protection laws as the country in which you provided
   the data. When we transfer your data to other countries, we will
   protect the data as described in this Privacy Policy and comply with
   applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the
   transfer of data to countries outside the EEA.

   If you are located in the EEA, we will only transfer your personal data
   if:
     * the country to which the personal data will be transferred has been
       granted a European Commission adequacy decision;
     * the recipient of the personal data is located in the US and has
       certified to the US-EU Privacy Shield Framework; or
     * we have put in place appropriate safeguards in respect of the
       transfer, for example we have entered into EU standard contractual
       clauses with the recipient, or the recipient is a party to binding
       corporate rules.

   You may request more information about the safeguards that we have put
   in place in respect of transfers of personal data by contacting us as
   described in How to contact us below.

   7. How we protect your personal data

   We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed
   to protect the personal data you provide against accidental, unlawful
   or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or
   use. Service providers and contractors who might have access to your
   data in order to provide services on our behalf will be contractually
   obliged to keep such data in confidence, provide adequate data security
   measures, and may not use that data for any other purpose.

   For your own protection, we encourage you not to include sensitive
   personal data, credit card or similar personal data in any e-mails you
   send us or our staff.

   8. How long we keep personal data for

   Belmond only retains your personal data for as long as needed to fulfil
   the purposes for which it is collected, unless we are required or
   permitted by law to keep the personal data for longer.

   Your personal data will be anonymised or deleted if your last
   interaction with Belmond was over 7 years ago. “Interaction with
   Belmond” includes for example visiting a Belmond Property or opening
   marketing communications from Belmond.

   3. Use of personal data

   As a provider of luxury hospitality experiences worldwide, Belmond has
   a legitimate business interest in operating and improving its business
   and the services it offers. Belmond therefore uses and processes your
   personal data to:
     * help us create content that is relevant to our visitors;
     * make improvements to our websites and social media pages and ensure
       that content on these is presented in the most effective manner for
       you;
     * provide you with information, products or services that you request
       from us or which we feel may interest you;
     * facilitate bookings, payment and other administrative processes
       related to your stay or travel;
     * assess and help us understand general trends and patterns relating
       to our business;
     * provide for the safety and security of our guests and visitors;
     * manage general record keeping;
     * enable us to compile anonymous, aggregated statistics that allow us
       to understand how users use our websites and to help us improve the
       structure of our websites;
     * enable you to make reservations, buy Belmond gift cards and
       payments;
     * meet any legal and/or regulatory requirements;
     * provide the products or services you request from us including
       providing personalised services; and
     * improve our products and services and to ensure our products and
       services are of interest to you.

   Even where Belmond has a legitimate interest in processing your
   personal data, it will not do so to the extent that processing would
   override your interests, rights and freedoms to protect your personal
   data.

   We may also use your personal data to protect against and prevent
   fraud, claims, and other liabilities and to comply with or enforce
   applicable legal requirements, industry standards, and our policies and
   terms. We use personal data for these purposes when it is necessary to
   protect, exercise or defend our legal rights, or when we are required
   to do so by applicable law.

   In the situations set out below, we will only process your personal
   data when you have given us your specific consent and you have the
   right to withdraw your consent at any time (see Your rights below):
     * marketing and profiling purposes which are managed solely by
       Belmond Management Limited as data controller for the Belmond
       Group. Your decision to provide your data for such purposes is
       optional and will have no consequence on your ability to stay with
       us or benefit from the requested services;
     * all purposes concerning your booking, your stay and to provide you
       with the services you have requested, which are managed by Belmond
       Management Limited and the Belmond property(ies) you visit as joint
       controllers. Your decision to provide personal data (including
       special category/sensitive personal data) to us is voluntary,
       however, if you do not provide such personal data you may no longer
       be able to benefit from our services.

   We may process your personal data by both automated and manual means.
   We may use your personal data in other ways for which we provide
   specific notice at the time of collection.

   4. Sharing personal data

   We do not sell, otherwise disclose, or share data we collect and hold
   about you, except as described in this Privacy Policy.

   We may share your personal data with third parties as described below:
     * other members of the Belmond Group, or our affiliated companies,
       which may use this data to offer products and services to you
       consistent with the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy;
     * third party service providers who have been appointed as data
       processors to perform functions and services on our behalf and who
       will be provided only with personal data necessary to perform the
       services on our behalf but are not authorised by us to use such
       data for any other purposes (e.g. providers of services in respect
       of web hosting, payment processing, information technology systems,
       customer relationship management, booking and reservations
       management, marketing, auditing, administration);
     * reservations management platforms used by you or Belmond to make
       reservations at Belmond restaurants, such as The Fork, OpenTable
       and ResDiary;
     * third party providers of components of any package holiday,
       excursion, transfer, concierge arranged activity/experience or
       other service we arrange for you;
     * to our advisors and insurers in the event of a claim, dispute or
       where otherwise necessary;
     * where the Belmond Property you visit is operated, but not owned by
       the Belmond Group, the owner of that Belmond Property (and its
       advisors and representatives);
     * if we are required to do so by law or pursuant to legal process or
       to comply with any applicable rules or regulations (including but
       not limited to the rules of the New York Stock Exchange), or in
       response to a request from a law enforcement authority or other
       government official; and
     * we reserve the right to transfer personal data about you in the
       event that we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or
       assets, in accordance with applicable law. Should such a sale or
       transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the
       transferee to use data you have provided to us in a manner that is
       consistent with this Privacy Policy. Following such a sale or
       transfer, you may contact the entity to which we transferred your
       data with any inquiries concerning the processing of that data.

   5. Your rights

   We will only send you marketing communications if you “opted in” to
   receiving such communications. You have the right to “opt out” of
   receiving marketing communications, whether by email or otherwise, at
   any time. You can do this by (i) clicking the unsubscribe link
   displayed in any of the marketing e-mails you receive, (ii) emailing
   privacy@belmond.com to indicate you no longer wish to receive marketing
   communications, or (iii) writing to us at the address set out in How to
   contact us below.

   Pursuant to California's "Shine the Light Act", California residents
   are permitted to request information about the manner in which we share
   certain categories of data with third parties for their marketing use.

   If you are a “data subject” under applicable EU data protection law,
   you will have the following rights in relation to personal data that we
   hold about you:

       personal data relating to you, and if so, to request a copy of that
       personal data;
     * Right to Rectification - to request that we rectify or update any
       personal data that is inaccurate, incomplete or outdated;
     * Right to Erasure - to request that we erase your personal data in

   6. Data transfers

   We may transfer to, and store the data we collect about you in,
   countries other than the country in which the data was originally
   collected, including the United States, Canada or other destinations
   outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Those countries may not
   have the same data protection laws as the country in which you provided
   the data. When we transfer your data to other countries, we will
   protect the data as described in this Privacy Policy and comply with
   applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the
   transfer of data to countries outside the EEA.

   If you are located in the EEA, we will only transfer your personal data
   if:
     * the country to which the personal data will be transferred has been
       granted a European Commission adequacy decision;
     * the recipient of the personal data is located in the US and has
       certified to the US-EU Privacy Shield Framework; or
     * we have put in place appropriate safeguards in respect of the
       transfer, for example we have entered into EU standard contractual
       clauses with the recipient, or the recipient is a party to binding
       corporate rules.

   You may request more information about the safeguards that we have put
   in place in respect of transfers of personal data by contacting us as
   described in How to contact us below.

   7. How we protect your personal data

   We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed
   to protect the personal data you provide against accidental, unlawful
   or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or
   use. Service providers and contractors who might have access to your
   data in order to provide services on our behalf will be contractually
   obliged to keep such data in confidence, provide adequate data security
   measures, and may not use that data for any other purpose.

   For your own protection, we encourage you not to include sensitive
   personal data, credit card or similar personal data in any e-mails you
   send us or our staff.

   8. How long we keep personal data for

   Belmond only retains your personal data for as long as needed to fulfil
   the purposes for which it is collected, unless we are required or
   permitted by law to keep the personal data for longer.

   Your personal data will be anonymised or deleted if your last
   interaction with Belmond was over 7 years ago. “Interaction with
   Belmond” includes for example visiting a Belmond Property or opening
   marketing communications from Belmond.
