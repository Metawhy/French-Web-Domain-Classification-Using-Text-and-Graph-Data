Total Recall (2012) Summary

   In a story set in the late 21st century, Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell)
   has disturbing recurring dreams about being a secret agent. Unable to
   shake the memories, he enters Rekall, a company that provides clients
   with artificial memories. When the memory implant goes horribly wrong,
   Quaid begins to suspect that he was in fact a secret agent whose
   current life as a low-level factory is actually the false memory
   implanted into his brain by the government. As Quaid struggles to
   distinguish between real and false memories, he is pursued by the
   police, led by the leader of the free world, Vilos Cohaagen (Bryan
   Cranston), chancellor of the UFB (United Federation of Britain). Quaid
   discovers that his service as an agent was working for Cohaagen, when
   he defected to the Resistance in an attempt to overthrow the UFB. His
   true memories were taken from from him when the UFB police captured
   him. Now, he must join forces with fellow agent Melina (Jessica Biel)
   to stop a ruthless plot to take over the colony in which they live
   while also trying to gain a total recall as to his true identity.

   As with most remakes, lovers of the original Total Recall film starring
   Arnold Schwarzenegger will probably be disappointed with this version.
   Yet despite the differences between the two films, this is a movie that
   is engaging, exciting, and with non-stop action that will keep science
   fiction and adventure fans on the edge of their seats from the opening
   scene. While some viewers might not like wondering what was “real” and
   what was false memory, other viewers enjoy the mystery of such
   uncertainty.
