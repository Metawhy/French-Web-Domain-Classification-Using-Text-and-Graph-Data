   THE BLOG OF RAINFOREST ACTION NETWORK

A 48 Hour Twitter Jam to Save Tripa

   posted by Rainforest Action Network

   Tripa burning This blog comes from our friends at End of the Icons.

   In an amazing global response to the tragedy in Tripa, thousands of
   people all around the world have emailed the President of Indonesia and
   key stakeholders calling for the law to be enforced and this precious
   peatland to be saved. We are happy to tell you it is already working.
   We are making a difference.

   After thousands of you signed the petition, the chairman of the REDD+
   Taskforce, Kuntoro Mangkusubroto, sent a team of lawyers to Tripa. They
   are on the ground collecting evidence right now. Your voice is
   effective. Now, we need your help to launch the next phase of the
   campaign to save Tripa and its inhabitants: a 48-hour Twitter jam.

   Tweet to the influential people who can help us in this case. The law
   is on our side, momentum is on our side, now we just need to make
   certain the court is on our side, and the criminals get punished for
   destroying Tripa! Use hashtag #savetripa in your tweets to help make it
   a trending topic. Foreign Minister Martyn is active on twitter, so we
   know he is one person who will get the message loud and clear — the
   whole world wants justice for Tripa. Here are some tweets you can post:
     * Dear Minister @martynatalegawa the world is watching how Indonesia
       enforces the law in Tripa! http://ow.ly/a0kaL #savetripa

   • The Indonesian President has received thousands of emails, let’s keep
   his attention focused!

     Dear president @soesilobambang we want to see JUSTICE in Tripa. This
     is our demand http://ow.ly/a0kaL #savetripa

   • The Minister of Forestry is responsible for deciding what forests get
   to live and what forests get cut down.

     Dear Ministry of Forestry @zul_hasan you have to make sure JUSTICE
     is served in Tripa http://ow.ly/a0kaL #savetripa”

   • The Minister of Agriculture should be investigating palm oil
   companies operating illegally all over Indonesia.

     Dear Minister @suswono palm oil company PT Kalista Alam is breaking
     the law in Tripa http://ow.ly/a0kaL #savetripa”

   • The Ministry of Justice and Human Rights has to make sure justice is
   served in court on April 3rd (more on that below).

     Dear @KEMENKUMHAM the world demands JUSTICE to be served in Tripa
     http://ow.ly/a0kaL #savetripa “

   • Originally the area of Forest that PT Kallista Alam is destroying was
   part of a multi-billion dollar forest protection deal between Norway
   and Indonesia. The people of Norway must be outraged that their money
   is going up in smoke!

     Dear @Kronprinsparet Norwegian taxpayer money is going up in smoke
     because of corrupt Indonesian officials
     http://ow.ly/a0oQ7 #savetripa

   • World Bank funds are used both for protection and destruction of the
   Leuser Ecosystem, the wider area in which Tripa lies. We’re asking them
   to investigate.

     @WorldBank money is used to fund the destruction of protected
     #orangutan habitat in Indonesia http://ow.ly/a0oMo #savetripa

   • The United Nations’ Great Ape Survival Partnership (GRASP) lists
   Tripa as a priority site for orangutan protection. We’re asking UNEP
   GRASP, UNEP and UNESCO to investigate.

     Dear @graspunep Tripa is a priority site for the protection of
     Orangutans http://ow.ly/a0oMo #savetripa Dear @UNEP Tripa is a
     priority site for the protection of Orangutans
     http://ow.ly/a0oMo #savetripa Dear @UNESCO Tripa is a priority site
     for the protection of Orangutans http://ow.ly/a0oMo #savetripa

   Burning protected forests and peatlands is against multiple Indonesian
   laws, and we will continue to watch this investigation very closely. In
   less than 48 hours, the court of Aceh will be announcing the judge’s
   verdict in the case against the major culprits in burning forests in
   Tripa, the PT Kallista Alam oil palm company and former governor
   Irwandi Yusuf. Allowing palm oil permits within the Tripa Peat Swamp
   Forest is against the law, as it is an integral part of the Leuser
   Ecosystem, home to rhinos, elephants, clouded leopards, tigers and of
   course, orangutans. Tripa is protected by the National Spatial Plan
   established by government regulation 26/2008 under the National Spatial
   Planning Law number 26/2007. “This is really a test case,” said Chik
   Rini, a World Wildlife Fund campaigner, noting that while it’s not
   uncommon for timber, pulp, paper and palm oil companies to raze trees
   in protected areas, few developments have occurred in Tripa, an area
   that seems so obviously off limits. “If they get away with it here,
   well, then no forests are safe.”

   The Independent wrote one of the most complete and accurate media
   stories to come out so far: Up in smoke: ecological catastrophe in the
   Sumatran swamps.

   ~~ Happy tweeting everyone! Please share this widely! – ~~ Never
   underestimate the power of your friends! ~~

Group Stages Mock Death Outside new RBC Branch in Protest of Bank’s
Involvement in Dirty Oil

   Feigned Collapses Represent Real Impacts of Tar Sands Destruction, and

   Customers visiting RBC’s newly opened downtown banking centre today
   were met with the sight of motionless bodies strewn along the pavement
   in front of the bank entrance.  The bodies were those of approximately
   x Rainforest Action Network (RAN) activists who, in protest against
   RBC’s continued financing of Alberta tar sands production, feigned
   death after symbolically drinking contaminated tar sands water.

   Leading all other Canadian banks, over the past four years RBC has
   provided $8.9 billion in financial support to companies operating in
   the tar sands.  The tar sands, which are devastating the regional
   environment, contaminating water sources, undermining local First
   Nation’s people’s health and preventing Canada from meeting its climate
   commitments, have become a source of global shame for Canada.  RAN is
   asking RBC to cease financing tar sands production and instead, provide
   financing for the production of renewable energy.

   “RBC, as Canada’s largest bank, is positioned to lead the country
   towards a future of energy sustainability and environmental
   stewardship,” says RAN activist Kimia Ghomeshi.  “Instead, RBC has
   chosen to become the ‘ATM’ for companies seeking financing for dirty
   tar sands production.  I think RBC’s customers would like to know what
   their bank is doing with the money in their savings and chequing
   accounts.”

   Tar sands projects, which extract and process bitumen, a type of crude
   oil, have become the leading cause of CO2 emissions growth in Canada.
   A water intensive process, production has resulted in the creation of
   over 130 km2 of toxic tailing ponds, which are now estimated to leak 11
   million litres of polluted water into the Athabasca watershed daily.
   Downstream from the tar sands, a Government of Alberta health study has
   confirmed that First Nations’ communities are now experiencing elevated
   levels of rare cancers.

   The protesters emphasized that RBC’s support of tar sands production is
   not consistent with its public commitments to leadership in the areas
   of corporate environmental sustainability and water conservation. As
   Melina Laboucan-Massimo, who is a member of the Lubicon Cree Nation,
   asked at the recent RBC annual shareholders meeting, “If RBC is serious
   about supporting clean water, why are they financing projects that are
   contaminating the lakes and rivers around my community?”

Setting the Record Straight: Cargill and Tripa Forest Controversy

   posted by Rainforest Action Network
   Will Cargill Act in the Interest of Orangutans and Adopt Safeguards?
   Will Cargill Act in the Interest of Orangutans and Adopt Safeguards?

   Although there are no major fires still tearing through the Tripa peat
   forest in Sumatra — the densest remaining Sumatran orangutan habitat in
   the world — updates from our allies on the ground tell us that Tripa is
   still gravely at risk. With one or two small fires still breaking out
   each day, combined with ongoing active forest clearing for palm oil
   plantations, the critically endangered orangutans depending on this
   forest for survival remain in danger.

   Despite the international spotlight on Tripa since late March, there is
   still active clearing and building of more drainage canals going deep
   into primary forest.

   I wish I could say that some of the largest players in the palm oil
   industry, such as Cargill, are doing everything in their power to
   ensure that controversial palm oil coming from these types of tragedies
   isn’t ending up in their supply chain (and our pantries), but that is
   definitely not the case.

   RAN’s report, Truth and Consequences: Palm Oil Plantations Push Unique
   Orangutan Population to Brink of Extinction, points out that Cargill
   has no safeguards on its global palm oil supply chain, and that without
   such safeguards Cargill cannot ensure it is not contributing to
   egregious violations like the one underway in the Tripa peat forest of
   Indonesia.

   Although Cargill is still misleading the public by releasing statements
   like the one from last week, titled, “Cargill Refutes Rainforest Action
   Network claims about Tripa Forest,” the bottom line remains: Cargill
   traffics a whopping 25% of the world’s palm oil and Cargill cannot
   ensure it is not trading palm oil from Tripa or parent companies
   profiting from the destruction of Tripa because it has no safeguards
   whatsoever in place to prevent it.

   RAN released an official response to Cargill’s misleading claims last
   week with the following key points:
     * Cargill claims that it “does not import Indonesian palm oil to the
       United States.” This is pure obfuscation. By Cargill’s own
       estimate, nearly 90 percent of the world’s palm oil is sourced from
       Indonesia and Malaysia, and the company traffics 25 percent of the
       world’s palm oil. Cargill’s claim that it does not ship any
       Indonesian palm oil into the U.S. is misleading and insincere, as a
       percentage of Indonesia’s palm oil is refined in Malaysia before
       being shipped to the US.

     * Cargill also claims that it is not associated with the devastating
       fires raging throughout the Tripa rainforest of Indonesia. Cargill
       is hiding behind a shell game of shifting company ownership and
       complicated trade relationships between a web of subsidiary
       suppliers. However, the fact is that Cargill has a history of
       trading with at least one company that has profited from the
       destruction of the priceless Tripa rainforest.Trade data held by
       Rainforest Action Network shows that Cargill shipped at least 4,000
       tons of crude palm oil produced by Astra Agro Lestari from the
       island of Sumatra in 2009. Astra Agro Lestari produced and exported
       palm oil from Tripa until at least 2010.
       According to Bloomberg, Astra Agro Lestari also sells millions of
       dollars of palm oil a year to industry giants Wilmar and Sinar
       Mas — two major suppliers of palm oil to Cargill. With a lack of
       supply chain transparency and no safeguards to prevent it, Cargill
       cannot in good faith claim never to have sold palm oil connected to
       the destruction of the endangered Tripa forest.

     * Cargill has an enormous influence to exercise on the global palm
       oil market. The only way Cargill can guarantee it is not
       contributing to the devastation underway in Indonesia is if it
       adopts explicit environmental, social and transparency safeguards
       to prevent it, which does not mean relying on a third party like
       the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). It does mean taking
       responsibility for the practices of its suppliers. Cargill as a
       company has not articulated its values for its supply chain,
       meaning it does not publicly position itself against common abuses
       associated with palm oil production like slave labor and
       deforestation.Cargill has stated an intention to phase
       RSPO-certified oil into its global supply chain by 2020. However,
       the RSPO has at best a very spotty track record of enforcing its
       own rules to prevent tragedies like the one underway in Tripa. At
       the rate of destruction occurring today, 2020 is too little, too
       late for the forests, people and wildlife of Southeast Asia.

   Just last week, Unilever, the world’s largest buyer of palm oil,
   announced a commitment to buy all of its palm oil, including its palm
   kernel oil, from traceable sources by 2020. Cargill’s modest
   commitments explicitly exclude palm kernel oil, an important commodity
   in the US market. Cargill also has no commitment to traceability, a
   crucial element for achieving transparency and accountability.

   Cargill is showing an alarming failure to deliver on its time-bound
   commitments, including to secure RSPO certification for all of its palm
   oil plantations by the end of 2010, and completion of a survey and
   review of the practices of its palm oil suppliers by early 2011.
