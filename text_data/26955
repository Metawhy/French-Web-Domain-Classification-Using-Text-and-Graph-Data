Where is the best place to sell my handcrafted products?

   This is what I ask myself every day! It is hard having an online
   shop... It is like a ghost town if you don't dump in a ton of money on
   marketing and advertising and even then you may not make enough
   sales... I've decided to make some changes to generate sales. I'm
   focusing more on my Etsy shop - this is somewhat of an experiment. I do
   know that Etsy has a lot of customers BUT also a lot of competition!

Anyone have advice for selling on line? Please share!

Am I an Expert??

   Am I an expert??  Good question... I never feel like an expert because
   there is so much I don't know, but I have learn so much the last 14
   years! I find when searching for information on organic and
   eco-friendly living, the vast majority of information is focused on
   organic food and safe cleaning products. My focus has always been on
   fabric, flooring, and furniture - Over the years I tried to fill this
   gap because I love sharing and teaching what I know with others.  Here
   is a little information about me:
     * 2000 - Started my interior design firm, Interiors by Samantha
       Cobos.
     * 2008 - Re-branded my design firm to focus on Green Design and
       renamed it PURE Inspired Design.
     * 2008 - Became a LEED AP (Leadership in Energy and Environmental
       Design Accredited Professional) - This is a test and it is HARD!
     * 2009 - Started this blog!
     * 2010 - Launched PURE Inspired Home, which provides Custom Organic
       Fabric and Eco-Friendly Upholstery.
     * 2012 - Built our eco-friendly PURE Sol Beach House featuring our
       PURE Beach Collection.
     * 2014 - Launched nest PURE, which provides organic and eco-friendly
       products that are all under $50.

   I've learned an enormous amount through the years so maybe I am sort of
   an expert...  In the coming weeks and months I will share with you my
   knowledge and insights on organic and eco-friendly products which will
   help make your home not only healthy for your family but also modern,
   happy, and fun!

Giving Thanks Beyond What is Easy...

   Sounds simple, but most of us have to stop and think - what am I truly
   thankful for? Of course I'm thankful for my family, kids, health, dog,
   home...  Those are easy things to be thankful for, but what about
   myself. On most days I'm moving so fast that I don't spend much time
   thinking of any one thing. Obviously I should be thankful for doing
   what I love... BUT what about everything that comes with running a
   small business - I've ran my own businesses for 14 years, and it is a
   constant struggle and at times devastating. I put everything I have
   into my business and my products but I'm still not thriving (not yet
   anyway). Work = Success is not necessarily true. I have some sad days
   and think, "Should just I quit"? NO WAY, NOT GOING TO HAPPEN! So what
   am I thankful for??

I am thankful for my optimism and perseverance!

What are you thankful for beyond the easy stuff??

Guess what I learned this week?

   What I learned this week...
    1. Taking pictures of myself using my camera's timer was unexpectedly
       funny. Running back and forth through an obstacle of furniture was
       quite tiring... This is what a solo entrepreneur does!
       [Model%2Bways%2Bto%2Bwear.JPG]
    2. When my wood veneer arrived I was literally jumping for joy - LOVE
       the idea of creating my own unique prints!
       [Both%2BSpiral%2Bframed%2B800.jpg]
    3. I NEED marketing help! I love to create but I'm at a loss when it
       comes to getting the word out about myself and my products.  Who is
       reading this blog - just a handful of people :) Plus only a 8
       entries so far for my Giveaway!
       [Feather_Flower_600_large.JPG]
    4. Green focused bloggers like Groovy Green Living and Mindful Momma
       are there to help me reach my audience! See our Dahlia Organic Tote
       in Mindful Momma's Gift Guide!
       [Gifts-for-Gals.jpg]
    5. I need a break from work!! So happy it is Friday!! Although a
       business owner never truly takes a break - can't shut off the
       brain, plus I LOVE what a do :)

Have a happy weekend everyone!!

New Modern Wood Prints!

   I've wanted to create a line of modern art prints for a long time. I
   finally came across the idea of printing on sustainably harvested maple
   veneer! Each print is finished with non-toxic wax for protection and
   sheen. This is just the start of the collection - designs are only
   limited by me so there will be many more coming quickly. Also
   customized prints with names and saying - send any ideas my way!
   They are available in two sizes:
     * 5" x 7" image - Size with mat 8" x 10" - Archival mat included!
     * 8" x 10" image - Size with mat 11" x 14" - Archival mat included!

   NO Frame is included at this time, but the prints are matted and fit in
   standard sized frames.

Modern Wood Prints make wonderful gifts at only $18 for 5" x 7" and $28 for
the 8" x 10"!

Why the Big Change?!

   I've made a BIG change over the last few weeks. I feel so at peace and
   happy about the change and I want to share not only the change, but the
   reason behind the change.
   Over the years I have struggled between doing what I love and trying to
   make money doing what I love. My products were priced high - a pillow
   cover started at $89!  I would joke that I can't even afford my own
   products - this made me stressed and uncomfortable. Why were my prices
   high? Well, creating products on demand is expensive plus offering
   trade discounts increase our prices even more...  Are our pillow covers
   really worth $89? Yes, I believe they are worth every penny. They are
   top quality, original, organic, made in the USA.... BUT could my reach
   go farther by lower my prices and changing my business model? YES! YES!
   YES!
   We are now nest PURE! It is not just a name change, it is whole new
   concept. All my products are still organic + eco-friendly and made in
   the USA, but they are also all under $50!
   Here is the criteria for our products:
     * Organic + Eco-Friendly
     * Made in the USA
     * Under $50
     * Quality Handmade Construction
     * Ships within 5 days
     * All fabrics are design by me and will not be found anywhere else!
     * New products added weekly

   How did I lower the prices?
     * I'm only selling what I currently have available
     * NO trade discounts or coupons because the prices are already low
     * Limited quantities â€“ Many items are one of a kind
     * Most of the fabrication is done in house (I do love to sew)

   Currently nest PURE sells Organic Pillow Covers, Organic Totes +
   Pouches, and Organic Crocheted Scarfs. Our quantities are very limited
   so if you see something you love don't hesitate!
   Coming soon - Modern Veneer Prints!
   Organic Pillow Covers
   Pillow Covers starting at $45
   [Dahlia%2BMustard%2BGray%2B1%2B800.JPG]
   Organic Totes starting at $38
