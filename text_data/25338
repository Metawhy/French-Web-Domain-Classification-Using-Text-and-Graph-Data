Youth unemployment rate in Europe January 2019

Youth unemployment rate in Europe (EU member states) as of January 2019
(seasonally adjusted)

   by H. Plecher, last edited Aug 27, 2019
   Youth unemployment rate in Europe January 2019 The statistic shows the
   seasonally adjusted youth unemployment rate in Europe (EU member
   states) as of January 2019. In this month, the seasonally adjusted
   youth unemployment rate in Spain was at 32.6 percent. The source
   defines youth unemployment as unemployment of those younger than 25
   years.
   Youth unemployment rate in Europe
   Unemployment is a crucial economic factor for a country; youth
   unemployment is often examined separately because it tends to be higher
   than unemployment in older age groups. It comprises the unemployment
   figures of a country’s labor force aged 15 to 24 years old (i.e. the
   earliest point at which mandatory school education ends). Typically,
   teenagers and those in their twenties who are fresh out of education do
   not find jobs right away, especially if the country’s economy is
   experiencing difficulties, as can be seen above. Additionally, it also
   tends to be higher in emerging markets than in industrialized nations.
   Worldwide, youth unemployment figures have not changed significantly
   over the last decade, nor are they expected to improve in the next few
   years.
   Youth unemployment is most prevalent in the Middle East and North
   Africa, even though these regions report high unemployment figures
   regardless (Zimbabwe and Turkmenistan are among the countries with the
   highest unemployment rates in the world, for example), and are also
   highly populated areas with a rather weak infrastructure, compared to
   industrialized regions.
   In the European Union and the euro area, unemployment in general has
   been on the rise since 2008, which is due to the economic crisis which
   caused bankruptcy and financial trouble for many employers, and thus
   led to considerable job loss, less job offerings, and consequently, to
   a rise of the unemployment rate. Older workers are struggling to find
   new jobs despite their experience, and young graduates are struggling
   to find new jobs, because they have none. All in all, the number of
   unemployed persons worldwide is projected to rise, this is not down to
   the economic crisis alone, but also the industrial automation of
   processes previously performed by workers, as well as rising population
   figures.

Global retail e-commerce sales 2014-2023

Retail e-commerce sales worldwide from 2014 to 2023 (in billion U.S. dollars)

   by J. Clement, last edited Aug 30, 2019
   Global retail e-commerce sales 2014-2023 This statistic gives
   information on retail e-commerce sales worldwide from 2014 to 2023. In
   2019, retail e-commerce sales worldwide amounted to 3.53 trillion US
   dollars and e-retail revenues are projected to grow to 6.54 trillion US
   dollars in 2022. The top 3 online stores' revenue amounted to almost
   100 billion US dollars in 2017. Online shopping is one of the most
   popular online activities worldwide but the usage varies by region - in
   2016, an estimated 19 percent of all retail sales in China occurred via
   internet but in Japan the share was only 6.7 percent. Desktop PCs are
   still the most popular device for placing online shopping orders but
   mobile devices, especially smartphones, are catching up.

   Homeownership rate in the U.S. 2019, by age

Jul 25, 2019 | Residential Property

Homeownership rate in the U.S. 2019, by age

   The homeownership rate among Americans under 35 years was 36.4 percent
   in the first quarter of 2019. The homeownership rate is the proportion
   of occupied households which are occupied by the owners. This reached
   its peak in 2004 before the 2007-2009 recession hit and decimated the
   housing market. The rate continued to fall until 2016, but has begun to
   increase again since then.

   Daily Disney+ app downloads in the Netherlands 2019

Sep 26, 2019 | Mobile Internet & Apps

Daily Disney+ app downloads in the Netherlands 2018-2019

   Consumers in the Netherlands are the first in the world to try out the
   new Disney+ streaming service. Starting Wednesday September 11
   (Android) and Friday September 13 (iOS), Dutch residents were able to
   sign up for free for an early version before its release in the US,
   Canada and the Netherlands on November 12. Thanks to figures provided
   by Priori Data (partnership), it is possible to get an idea of how the
   new video streaming service launched in the European country. In the
   first week (from September 13 up until September 20), the Disney+ app
   reached nearly 220,000 downloads. The source does not mention whether
   one download equals single person use or whether multiple persons in a
   household, such as children, use the app alongside their parents. In
   2018, there were around 7.8 million households in the Netherlands. Why
   the Netherlands? Three main reasons are mentioned why the Netherlands
   became the test ground for Disney's video service. First, the country
   had relatively many high-speed internet connections. Second, the
   Netherlands is quite used to Video on Demand (VoD) as can be seen in
   the market size of Netflix and other domestic VoD services versus DVD
   and Blue-ray sales. Netflix's revenue in the Netherlands, for example,
   grew from 120 million euros in 2015 to 220 million euros in 2018.
   Finally, the Netherlands has no issues with the English language. This
   can be seen in, for example, the podcast listening behavior of Dutch
   consumers in 2019 and their preference for podcasts that were either
   partially or fully in English. To Infinity, And Beyond? As of 2018, the
   Walt Disney Company's total assets were worth over 98 billion U.S.
   dollars. In the same year, the media company and owner of Pixar
   Studios, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic generated a global
   revenue of 59.43 billion U.S. dollars, the highest figure to-date. The
   company is divided in five different segments: Studio Entertainment,
   Parks and Resorts, Disney Consumer Products, Media Networks (which
   includes ABC, Disney Channels, ESPN, Hulu), and Disney Interactive.
   Streaming service Disney+ could make the high reach of "the House of
   Mouse" even bigger.

   Opinion on proroguing Parliament to force a no-deal Brexit in Great
   Britain 2019

Opinion on proroguing Parliament to force a no-deal Brexit in Great Britain
2019

   Close to half of British adults were opposed to the suggestion of
   forcing through a no-deal Brexit by 'proroguing' Parliament according
   to an opinion poll taken shortly the UK government announced it's
   intention to do just that on August 28, 2019. The idea of preventing
   MPs from voting against a no-deal Brexit by formally ending the
   Parliamentary session shortly before the Brexit deadline in October
   2019 was brought forward by some candidates for the leadership of the
   UK's Conservative Party. Among Remain voters, 73 percent were opposed
   to prorogation, whereas 51 percent of Leave voters supported the idea.

Youth unemployment rate in Europe January 2019

Youth unemployment rate in Europe (EU member states) as of January 2019
(seasonally adjusted)

   by H. Plecher, last edited Aug 27, 2019
   Youth unemployment rate in Europe January 2019 The statistic shows the
   seasonally adjusted youth unemployment rate in Europe (EU member
   states) as of January 2019. In this month, the seasonally adjusted
   youth unemployment rate in Spain was at 32.6 percent. The source
   defines youth unemployment as unemployment of those younger than 25
   years.
   Youth unemployment rate in Europe
   Unemployment is a crucial economic factor for a country; youth
   unemployment is often examined separately because it tends to be higher
   than unemployment in older age groups. It comprises the unemployment
   figures of a country’s labor force aged 15 to 24 years old (i.e. the
   earliest point at which mandatory school education ends). Typically,
   teenagers and those in their twenties who are fresh out of education do
   not find jobs right away, especially if the country’s economy is
   experiencing difficulties, as can be seen above. Additionally, it also
   tends to be higher in emerging markets than in industrialized nations.
   Worldwide, youth unemployment figures have not changed significantly
   over the last decade, nor are they expected to improve in the next few
   years.
   Youth unemployment is most prevalent in the Middle East and North
   Africa, even though these regions report high unemployment figures
   regardless (Zimbabwe and Turkmenistan are among the countries with the
   highest unemployment rates in the world, for example), and are also
   highly populated areas with a rather weak infrastructure, compared to
   industrialized regions.
   In the European Union and the euro area, unemployment in general has
   been on the rise since 2008, which is due to the economic crisis which
   caused bankruptcy and financial trouble for many employers, and thus
   led to considerable job loss, less job offerings, and consequently, to
   a rise of the unemployment rate. Older workers are struggling to find
   new jobs despite their experience, and young graduates are struggling
   to find new jobs, because they have none. All in all, the number of
   unemployed persons worldwide is projected to rise, this is not down to
   the economic crisis alone, but also the industrial automation of
   processes previously performed by workers, as well as rising population
   figures.

   The statistic shows the seasonally adjusted youth unemployment rate in
   Europe (EU member states) as of January 2019. In this month, the
   seasonally adjusted youth unemployment rate in Spain was at 32.6
   percent. The source defines youth unemployment as unemployment of those
   younger than 25 years.
   Youth unemployment rate in Europe
   Unemployment is a crucial economic factor for a country; youth
   unemployment is often examined separately because it tends to be higher
   than unemployment in older age groups. It comprises the unemployment
   figures of a country’s labor force aged 15 to 24 years old (i.e. the
   earliest point at which mandatory school education ends). Typically,
   teenagers and those in their twenties who are fresh out of education do
   not find jobs right away, especially if the country’s economy is
   experiencing difficulties, as can be seen above. Additionally, it also
   tends to be higher in emerging markets than in industrialized nations.
   Worldwide, youth unemployment figures have not changed significantly
   over the last decade, nor are they expected to improve in the next few
   years.
   Youth unemployment is most prevalent in the Middle East and North
   Africa, even though these regions report high unemployment figures
   regardless (Zimbabwe and Turkmenistan are among the countries with the
   highest unemployment rates in the world, for example), and are also
   highly populated areas with a rather weak infrastructure, compared to
   industrialized regions.
   In the European Union and the euro area, unemployment in general has
   been on the rise since 2008, which is due to the economic crisis which
   caused bankruptcy and financial trouble for many employers, and thus
   led to considerable job loss, less job offerings, and consequently, to
   a rise of the unemployment rate. Older workers are struggling to find
   new jobs despite their experience, and young graduates are struggling
   to find new jobs, because they have none. All in all, the number of
   unemployed persons worldwide is projected to rise, this is not down to
   the economic crisis alone, but also the industrial automation of
   processes previously performed by workers, as well as rising population
   figures.

Global retail e-commerce sales 2014-2023

Retail e-commerce sales worldwide from 2014 to 2023 (in billion U.S. dollars)

   by J. Clement, last edited Aug 30, 2019
   Global retail e-commerce sales 2014-2023 This statistic gives
   information on retail e-commerce sales worldwide from 2014 to 2023. In
   2019, retail e-commerce sales worldwide amounted to 3.53 trillion US
   dollars and e-retail revenues are projected to grow to 6.54 trillion US
   dollars in 2022. The top 3 online stores' revenue amounted to almost
   100 billion US dollars in 2017. Online shopping is one of the most
   popular online activities worldwide but the usage varies by region - in
   2016, an estimated 19 percent of all retail sales in China occurred via
   internet but in Japan the share was only 6.7 percent. Desktop PCs are
   still the most popular device for placing online shopping orders but
   mobile devices, especially smartphones, are catching up.

   Homeownership rate in the U.S. 2019, by age

Jul 25, 2019 | Residential Property

Homeownership rate in the U.S. 2019, by age

   The homeownership rate among Americans under 35 years was 36.4 percent
   in the first quarter of 2019. The homeownership rate is the proportion
   of occupied households which are occupied by the owners. This reached
   its peak in 2004 before the 2007-2009 recession hit and decimated the
   housing market. The rate continued to fall until 2016, but has begun to
   increase again since then.

   Daily Disney+ app downloads in the Netherlands 2019

Sep 26, 2019 | Mobile Internet & Apps

Daily Disney+ app downloads in the Netherlands 2018-2019

   Consumers in the Netherlands are the first in the world to try out the
   new Disney+ streaming service. Starting Wednesday September 11
   (Android) and Friday September 13 (iOS), Dutch residents were able to
   sign up for free for an early version before its release in the US,
   Canada and the Netherlands on November 12. Thanks to figures provided
   by Priori Data (partnership), it is possible to get an idea of how the
   new video streaming service launched in the European country. In the
   first week (from September 13 up until September 20), the Disney+ app
   reached nearly 220,000 downloads. The source does not mention whether
   one download equals single person use or whether multiple persons in a
   household, such as children, use the app alongside their parents. In
   2018, there were around 7.8 million households in the Netherlands. Why
   the Netherlands? Three main reasons are mentioned why the Netherlands
   became the test ground for Disney's video service. First, the country
   had relatively many high-speed internet connections. Second, the
   Netherlands is quite used to Video on Demand (VoD) as can be seen in
   the market size of Netflix and other domestic VoD services versus DVD
   and Blue-ray sales. Netflix's revenue in the Netherlands, for example,
   grew from 120 million euros in 2015 to 220 million euros in 2018.
   Finally, the Netherlands has no issues with the English language. This
   can be seen in, for example, the podcast listening behavior of Dutch
   consumers in 2019 and their preference for podcasts that were either
   partially or fully in English. To Infinity, And Beyond? As of 2018, the
   Walt Disney Company's total assets were worth over 98 billion U.S.
   dollars. In the same year, the media company and owner of Pixar
   Studios, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic generated a global
   revenue of 59.43 billion U.S. dollars, the highest figure to-date. The
   company is divided in five different segments: Studio Entertainment,
   Parks and Resorts, Disney Consumer Products, Media Networks (which
   includes ABC, Disney Channels, ESPN, Hulu), and Disney Interactive.
   Streaming service Disney+ could make the high reach of "the House of
   Mouse" even bigger.

   Opinion on proroguing Parliament to force a no-deal Brexit in Great
   Britain 2019

Opinion on proroguing Parliament to force a no-deal Brexit in Great Britain
2019

   Close to half of British adults were opposed to the suggestion of
   forcing through a no-deal Brexit by 'proroguing' Parliament according
   to an opinion poll taken shortly the UK government announced it's
   intention to do just that on August 28, 2019. The idea of preventing
   MPs from voting against a no-deal Brexit by formally ending the
   Parliamentary session shortly before the Brexit deadline in October
   2019 was brought forward by some candidates for the leadership of the
   UK's Conservative Party. Among Remain voters, 73 percent were opposed
   to prorogation, whereas 51 percent of Leave voters supported the idea.
