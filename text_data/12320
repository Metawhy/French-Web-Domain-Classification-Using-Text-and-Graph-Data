Welcome My Fascicle on JPA

   20/05/2019 Leave a Comment

   Last year I’ve published a fascicle on Bean Validation. It was time to
   publish the one on JPA. In a previous blog post I explained the entire
   writing process and why I had this idea of writing small fascicles.
   Make sure to read it if you want more details. But basically, the idea
   behind these fascicles comes from my previous […]

JHipster, Angular, PrimeNG and AutoComplete

   08/11/2018 5 Comments

   JHipster is a great way to bootstrap your application. Your app can be
   a monolith or be split into several microservices, use JWT or OAuth2,
   packaged with Docker, deployed on a cloud provider… JHipster is there
   to handle the heavy technical complexity. Great ! But… when it comes to
   choosing an item from a combobox, JHipster is not that great. […]

Angular Libraries and Microservices

   13/08/2018 9 Comments

   We live in a Microservices world, and this world is there to stay.
   Back-end developers need to dive into Domain Driven Design, write
   stateless, resilient, highly available services, keep data synchronized
   through Change Data Capture, handle network failure, deal with
   authentication, authorization, JWT… and expose a beautiful Hypermedia
   API so the front-end developers can add a great user interface to it.
   Good ! […]

   there. For those wondering when I’ll be updating my book to Java EE 8,
   I’ll say “I’ll never write again!”…. But never say never. I’ll never
   write again Involved in […]

Java EE vs Spring Testing

   16/01/2018 9 Comments

   I’ve recently posted a Tweet about my day to day life. This Tweet said
   “I’ve reached a point where I can test Spring code in a couple of
   minutes, and Java EE code in a couple of hours :o(“ I was a bit
   surprised to read some reactions. In fact, some people asked me to
   explain this Tweet a bit […]

Configuring the AsciiDoctor Maven Plugin

   22/08/2017 1 Comment

   AsciiDoc is a great way to write technical documentation. It is text
   based, can be committed and versionned in your VSC with your project,
   has a rich syntax, has a huge ecosystem, integrates with several tools
   (such as PlantUML that I love) and, if there is still something
   missing, you can use extensions or create your own. And if you […]
