Coming along quite nicely.

   [glasses.png]
   Just when I thought I 'got it', I couldn't have been more wrong.
   Really.
   I'm referring to my faith.  My spiritual journey.
   If you are new around here, this may come as a surprise.  If not, you
   are certainly aware of my struggles.
   I like to think that I represent the common {wo}man.  A Christian that
   is a Christian because...well, what else would I be?
   Make no mistake...I've never been one to be complacent about my
   spirituality.  I've always investigated, read, researched.  Other
   faiths have always especially intrigued me.  Maybe it's the scholar in
   me.  Maybe it's just plain curiosity.  Maybe it's wanting to understand
   just how much most of our beliefs have so many of the same
   fundamentals.
   Who knows?
   For whatever reason, I was at a point that I was satisfied with my
   Christianity {more specifically, Catholicism}.
   Almost smug in the fact that I was one step ahead.  I 'got it'.  Church
   on Sunday, a bit of light scripture reading, prayers of gratitude at
   night, or prayers for help & guidance when things were hard.  God was
   on my side, and that was something that not everyone really
   understood.  But I wasn't one of 'those' people.  No, sir.
   Recently, I have been 'uninspired' to say the least concerning my
   spiritual growth.  It plateaued for lack of a better explanation.
   Never reverting, but certainly never reaching towards grace.  Never
   glorifying this God that was responsible for all of my many blessings.
   Just continuing on the same way, everyday.
   On a whim, my family and I attended church with my sister and her lot
   on Easter.  It's a different church.  A church my old school Catholic
   mom & dad were less than thrilled about her attending.
   But, she's been there for about 2 years.
   And she talks about it.  She more often than not seems inspired by the
   sermons.  Her kids love it.  Her borderline agnostic husband is now a
   believer.  I've witnessed with my own 2 eyes this church's message work
   its way into the hearts of several of my extended family members.
   That message?
   It couldn't be simpler...the Bible.
   No smoke & mirrors.  No snake charmers, no one speaking in toungues.
   No 'write your check and we'll promise miracles for you & yours'.
   Needless to say, we've gone every week since.
   Let me clarify...this isn't about 'church'.  This isn't about checking
   that box off of our 'to do' list week after week.
   For me, it's about finding those 'aha' moments within my faith.  The
   times where even for a just a fraction of a moment, I am unwavering.
   Everything clicks.  I am filled with a lightness that can not be
   duplicated with any other earthly endeavor.
   And what I realized, no matter how difficult it was for me to
   understand, is that God is there, but you have to seek Him out.  You
   have to do the work.  YOU have to SEEK Him.  NOT the other way around.
   How full of myself I've been all of these years.  How arrogant to think
   that the God that made the Heavens and the Earth would go out of his
   way to seek ME out in a deliberate way to have a relationship with
   Him.  It's foolish, really.  Any human relationship requires work, why
   would a relationship of a divine nature be any different? If not harder
   to develop?
   I've heard this analogy before...an adult plays hide and seek with a
   young child.  The adult hides under the bed, but with their legs
   hanging out from underneath the bed frame.  The child sees those legs
   no doubt, but may have had to walk around the house a bit before they
   made their discovery.  The child is comforted in the fact that those
   legs sticking out meant the adult was there all along, but is also
   pleased that he 'found' him or her.
   The presence of God is always there looming over us.  Accessible.
   Available.  Just not always obvious. Does that confuse the heck out of
   you?  Hope not.
   When I think about it...it makes me sad.  During the most difficult
   time in my life {to date}, I thought I was carried along by God.  And
   He was there, of course, somewhere.  But I didn't look.  I just
   assumed.  I never cried out for His help.  I never poured myself out to
   Him.
   I wonder how much different the experience with Betsy in those early
   years would have been if I'd tried to do those things.  I was grateful
   just to wake up each day, and meet my kids' needs.  If I had had a
   deepened relationship with the Boss maybe I could've found joy in small
   things when it was so, so hard just to make it until bedtime.
   He is eminent to be sure, but we have to ask him into our lives.
   I have so much work to do.  I don't think I'm ready to testify after
   only a month.  That almost seems laughable to me right now.  And, the
   truth is...I may never be.
   But I take comfort in knowing that I'm on the path.  There are days I
   feel like that path has no end, or it is full of too many roadblocks to
   bother.  In just four weeks, I have had more days than not, that I
   think it's not worth it.  Maybe I'm not worth it.  But, one tiny thing
   will change that.  A passage from scripture {of which I've never really
   read, not like I do now, anyway}, Rosie riding her bike with no
   training wheels, Pete helping Betsy off of the bus, Jake helping to
   clear the dinner table without being asked.  That's God's work.  I like
   to think I had a hand in it, but it all goes back to Him.
   I hope some of you aren't balking at the fact that I/we Christians
   cling to an empty promise.  I certainly don't take offense to your
   personal beliefs.  And, not to get all Donald Miller on you, I also
   apologize if you've had any negative experiences with people carrying
   messages of hate who claim to be a Christian.  That is a shame.
   Jesus's message was love.  Charity, outreach, forgiveness.  No matter
   your skin color, beliefs, actions, unlawfulness.  In all honesty, it
   doesn't get much more liberal than that. And every single person on the
   planet deserves those things.  Every last one.
   And you doubters, the unfaithful...you may be right.  Maybe.
   But, I've never been the gambling type, and I'm not willing to take
   that chance.  And so my faith stays in tact.  My heart believes it ALL
   to be true.
   And for that...I am pleased.

'SCM' makes everything better.

   [1.jpg]
   It has been one hot mutha in the Lou already.  Around here with the
   heat comes sno-cones {aka snow balls, snowcones, snow cones, etc}.
   Last year we bought an ice shaver.  It makes the ice fine enough to
   make our own version.  We have since collected lots of syrups {mostly
   from Target}, and sometimes do toppings like sprinkles, whipped cream,
   cherries, etc.
   [4.jpg]
   [7.jpg]
   We are all kind of obsessed with the 'cream tops' that most of the New
   Orleans style sno-cone stands offer around here.  I was thinking it
   wasn't attainable at home, and mostly had just decided it was something
   we could only get at our favorite local stand.
   BUT...
   with a little research and testing, we can now add it to our own
   'options' list when we make them ourselves.
   Enter the lead player: Sweetened Condensed Milk {SCM}
   [3.jpg]
   From what I understand, this is mainly a southern thing.  But, rest
   assured...once you give it a try, it will become a 'wherever-you-live'
   thing.
   You can spoon it on top straight out of the can if you like, but we
   like it best mixed with a little milk.  I would guess I put about 2
   TBSP. of milk to one can of SCM.
   I just whisk it up...
   [5.jpg]
   and VOILA!
   [8.jpg]
   After you make your sno-cone to your liking, you just spoon the SCM
   mixture on top.  That's it!  To make it extra fun, you can serve it in
   fun cups or paper cones with even cuter spoons or straws.
   [2.jpg]
   [9.jpg]
   This time I did even more experimenting and tried a 'Viatnamese Coffee'
   sno-cone.  All I did was take Pioneer Woman Iced Coffee concentrate,
   pour it over the shaved ice, and added the cream top.
   So, so good!
   I think next time, I may try just freezing some strong coffee in an ice
   cube tray, and actually shaving that, but it was still really good.
   Definitely worth giving it a try.
   [6.jpg]
   Enjoy!

Swiss Meringue Buttercream...wha?!?!?

   [2.png]

   I loathe canned frosting.
   LOATHE.
   It tastes like shortening, and makes me want to lose my lunch.
   Typically, my go to buttercream recipe is from Sweetopolita.
   {Read all about it here...tips, recipe, etc.}
   I cannot say enough good things about this recipe.
   It is THE BEST buttercream...EVER!
   It goes on so smooth that I have often been asked if it's fondant.
   Best part it tastes so, so, so, so, so good.
   [2.png]
   BUT...
   {did you know a 'but' was coming?}
   it isn't the quickest frosting to whip up, and there are several steps
   including egg whites on the stove top.  The recipe also yields a TON,
   and I often times forget I have some in the freezer.
   So, today I made donuts {we're crazy obsessed now, thanks to THIS}, and
   wanted to slather them in Swiss Meringue Buttercream, but didn't have
   the energy to make it.
   [3.png]
   On a wing and a prayer, I decided to make the Almost-Homemade Vanilla
   Buttercream by Karen Tack featured in this month's issue of Better
   Homes & Gardens.
   OMG!
   It is a pretty strong contender for the real thing considering it's
   sort of a cheat, using marshmallow creme instead of egg whites and
   sugar.
   It's quick, it's easy, it's good.
   I mean, why wouldn't it be?  It has 3 sticks of butter in it.
   [2.png]
   Almost-Homemade Vanilla Buttercream
   {via Better Homes & Gardens}
   1 1/2 cups {3 sticks} unsalted butter
   1 16 oz. jar marshmallow creme*
   1/2 cup powdered sugar
   1 tsp. vanilla
   In large mixing bowl beat butter with mixer on medium until light and
   fluffy.  Add marshmallow creme and beat until smooth, scraping sides.
   Add powdered sugar and vanilla; beat until light and fluffy (if too
   stiff, soften in microwave no more than 10 seconds; beat until
   smooth).  Use to frost cake.  Or store, refrigerated, up to three days
   or freeze up to a month.  Bring to room temperature before frosting
   cake.
   Makes 3 cups.
   *If only 13 oz. jars are available in your area, add 3 oz. (3/4 cup)
   additional marshmallow creme.
   For a sweet & salty contrast, add 1/4 tsp. of salt.
   You, my friends, are very, very welcome.

Mad Music Monday...

   This week I chose M83.
   They are coming to The Pageant in St.Louis this May, and I'm hoping my
   cousin and I are going to go.  (Michelle: if you're reading
   this...HINT, HINT!)
   They are just really, really good.
   It's lock yourself in the bathroom for 10 minutes, and breathe kind of
   music.
   I do that.
   Do you?
   If not, you should.
   I highly recommend it.
   In fact, you could do it after you read this post, and play the 2 You
   Tube vids I posted.
   That would be nice.
   You'll like it.
   I promise.
   The 10 minute break, and the tunes.
   Ear buds might help.
   Just sayin'.

Time.

   [1.png]
   So, I obviously cannot post everyday, but I'm hoping to post every few
   days.  I think that sounds pretty reasonable.
   It's a matter of time.  And time isn't usually very friendly.
   Especially to me.
   I don't know what has happened in the last 6 months or so, but I have
   significantly less of it.
   I look at my little nuggets and can't believe how big they are, how
   independent they are, and how much they know.
   Certainly, Rosie was just spending her days happily nursing and
   snuggling the away, while Betsy got in-home therapy almost everyday,
   and the boys were boisterously wrestling on the floor or jumping off
   the couch...oh wait, the boys still do that.
   Anyway, enough of that nostalgic stuff.
   Even though, time robs us of so much, it also allows for friendships to
   blossom, wounds to heal, knowledge to be gained.
   I have met many people through my blog.  Over time.
   None has come to mean as much to me as Crystal.
   I never would have thought that of all the people I 'knew' from blog
   land, that she would be the dear friend to me that she is today.  Over
   time our spunky debates turned into quite a camaraderie.
   And, in time...I will see her in real life.
   How's that for time being on my side?

Mad Music Monday...

   So, I used to do 'Hump Day Ear Candy' on Wednesday, but because things
   seem to be new around here, AND because my corpus callosum hurts on
   Mondays...I thought I would move Wednesday's post to Monday leaving
   Wednesday open for things I would normally post on Monday.  {Is anyone
   else thinking about the teacher in 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate
   Factory'?}
   So, after thinking long and hard about what band to post today, I have
   decided to share 'The Velvet Underground'.
   Certainly, this band isn't new to most people...quite the opposite
   actually, but I love them so.
   For me...it's Sunday Funday music.  True rock-n-roll written and
   performed by real rock-n-roll musicians.  {And, yes...the kind of band
   that was all sex, drugs, & the music, managed by Andy Warhol for
   goodness sake. It was the 60s-70s, people...c'mon.}
   So, sit on your patio with a cold beverage with the sun setting low,
   and enjoy this music for what it is.
   Magic.

   PS I'm not entirely sure what a corpus callosum is or does, but I know
   it's in your brain, and I know that my brain hurts on Mondays.  Plus,
   it sounds super official.

Do it. Now.

   [4.png]
   Since I haven't blogged in ages, I have lots of things to share with
   you that are happening or have happened at the House of Grebe.
   A quick share would be the stenciled entry.
   I have always loved Orla Kiely's multi-stem wallpaper, but haven't ever
   had the chops to buck up and buy it.  It really isn't all that pricey
   for wallpaper, but I was afraid Big Daddy might have a few choice words
   for me if I asked him to wallpaper on top of the myriad of other things
   he has been doing around here.  So...
   I decided to try and stencil the design.
   [1.png]
   I went to Hobby Lobby and bought a pack of uncut stencil paper.  I
   think it was about $4 for 3 sheets.  I also picked up a new exacto
   knife so that the blade was extra sharp.
   Next, I blew up the multi stem design in Photoshop and printed it.
   Then, I just traced it onto the stencil sheet.  Finally, I cut out the
   design with the exacto knife.  I did leave the top and bottom edges of
   the design uncut so that I could use those as a guide to line up the
   pattern as I moved along.  Does that make any sense?
   Because there were so many colors involved, and the fact that walls are
   not perfectly straight but I wanted to make sure the design looked
   level, it was a slow moving process.
   [3.png]
   [2.png]
   Off and on, it took me about 2 days to finish.  When the stenciling
   itself was complete, I had to touch up around the door frames, and
   ceiling.  Then to give it a more worn finish, I lightly sanded over all
   the walls.
   I am super pleased, and it gives the entry a little space definition
   from the rest of the space since we have such an open concept floor
   plan.  My sister says it looks like a circus, which secretly makes me
   quite pleased.  I mean, c'mon...the circus is super fun, AND you can
   buy loads of cotton candy there.
   Anywho, if you've ever thought about stenciling, but couldn't find a
   design you liked, this is a pretty easy, albeit time consuming
   project.
   The only advice I have is that make sure your stencil brush or sponge
   is almost COMPLETELY devoid of paint before you start the stencil
   process.  Otherwise, the paint will bleed under the stencil and onto
   the walls for a very unpleasant effect.  LESS IS MORE.  I never thought
   I'd say that, but in this particular case it's very true.
   [4.png]
   **Please ignore the shoe basket as we are a 'no shoe' household.
   It is always overflowing because no one puts their shoes in their
   closet.  Don't get me started.**
   ﻿
   Let me know if you have any questions about this project.
   Or the circus.
   I would be happy to discuss either.

Lifted up.

   [me.png]
   I have convinced myself, as of late, that no one really reads this, and
   thus have silently slunk away.
   If you couldn't tell.
   But, lately, I've been inspired to keep up with my old friend, the
   blog.
   Mostly because of a group of lovely people on Instagram.
   I have found a niche of lovely people that have become more than just a
   community of like minded 'techie-nerds', but more like an interweb
   family.
   Oh, if only we could all fly to the same place and spend a day in the
   sun together...
   Now wouldn't that be lovely?
   Life has been more than distracting lately.  I am having a hard time
   keeping up with 'older' kids and all of their sports and school
   commitments.  Which is ironic considering we limit activities, sports,
   and clubs to one thing a season/semester.  We have approached a time
   when seasons overlap for several weeks, and games and practices have
   become to numerous to talk about.
   Is it wrong that I would be perfectly content if they wanted to stay
   home and read books?  Ha!
   Which is strange since I was VERY active in my adolescence both
   athletically and academically, and Big Daddy played numerous sports and
   continued with football in college.  I like to refer to my mom style as
   vintage parenting rather than lazy parenting.  That's seems fair.  The
   whole 'keep it simple, stupid' phrase is constantly resonating in my
   head every time I'm approached with a new sign up sheet.
   Alas, it makes them happy to play, and participate, and learn.  They
   get fantastic grades, and are good kids.  I don't get to decide
   everything for them, even though I wished I could.
   Life is fast, and I can only slow down so much.  We must be doing
   something right if I hear them say CONSTANTLY that their friends get
   video games whenever they want, have cell phones, TVs in their rooms,
   etc.  The pace here is slower than outside of these walls, but
   certainly not as slow as when we were kids.
   Which all I can say, although not eloquently, is that is dumb.
   What's the rush?  Time robs us of so much already, why do we push it
   along?
   So, after all that rambling...I can safely say {disregard all the times
   I've said it before}, that I'm back.
   And this time, something feels different when I say it.
   Really.
