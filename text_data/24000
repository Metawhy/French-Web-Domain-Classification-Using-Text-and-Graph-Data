3 Major Questions We Have About WarnerMedia’s $500M Deal With J.J. Abrams

   On Monday, it was reported that WarnerMedia is close to signing a $500
   million deal with Bad Robot, the production outfit from J.J. Abrams and
   wife Katie McGrath, following an industry-wide sweepstakes that
   included pitches from Apple, Disney, NBCUniversal, and Netflix. Abrams
   and Bad Robot Pictures have been locked into a small-screen deal with
   Warner Bros. TV since 2006. On the big screen, Abrams’ deal with
   Paramount Pictures expired last summer (Paramount ended up getting
   screwed a bit in their deal, but that’s a story for another day).

   While this new mega-deal opens up all sorts of enticing blockbuster
   opportunities for the prolific writer-producer-director (Bad Robot did
   help revive the Mission: Impossible, Star Trek and Star Wars
   franchises, after all) it also raises several key questions.

   Subscribe to Observer’s Entertainment Newsletter

What kind of deal is WarnerMedia getting with Abrams?

   Specific details of the looming agreement remain a mystery. Under
   Paramount Pictures, Abrams had a first-look agreement which gave the
   studio the right of first refusal on any and all film projects from Bad
   Robot. However, his deal was also non-exclusive in terms of directing,
   which is why he was legally able to helm two Star Wars films for Disney
   while under contract at Paramount.

   According to The New York Times, WarnerMedia will enjoy a first-look
   deal with projects developed by Bad Robot, which will cover film, TV,
   video games, consumer products, music and digital content. Yet at this
   time, it is unknown if there is a similar non-compete clause built into
   the language of the deal. Given Paramount’s frustration with Abrams’
   lack of availability due to Star Wars, it’s hard to believe WarnerMedia
   would want him on the open market. Then again, with the abundance of
   eager suitors, Bad Robot held all the leverage.

   Bad Robot may soon be under the WarnerMedia umbrella, but it is
   believed that it is still free to work on existing outside TV projects
   such as the three series it has in development for Apple’s upcoming
   streaming service. Bad Robot boasts more than 50 movies and shows in
   development or production at the moment, per IMDBpro.

Can AT&T properly leverage this win?

   Wells Fargo analysts downgraded AT&T’s outlook last summer as its Time
   Warner acquisition represented a massive $85.4 billion investment into
   foreign business. While the former Time Warner has plenty of experience
   creating original programming, AT&T does not. The ongoing melding of
   commerce and art will be a difficult transition for both entities, and
   analysts at the time of the deal’s approval expressed concern that the
   telecom conglomerate now had too many “balls to juggle.”

   AT&T currently has $171 billion in debt, though CEO Randall Stephenson
   has pledged to correct this by 2022. At the same time, WarnerMedia is
   widely expected to reclaim exclusive broadcasting rights to popular
   library content such as Friends, which Netflix is licensing for a hefty
   $100 million throughout 2019, at the end of the year.

   Further denting confidence in AT&T is the tumultuous first year of the
   newly formed WarnerMedia. Since AT&T gained control of Time Warner
   following a drawn out battle against the Department of Justice, several
   key executives have fled the company. CEO Jeff Bewkes departed last
   June with Turner CEO John Martin. In February, HBO CEO Richard Plepler
   stepped down and Warner Bros. Entertainment CEO Kevin Tsujihara
   resigned after admitting to an inappropriate relationship with an
   actress. CNBC also reports that WarnerMedia head John Stankey’s
   leadership style hasn’t always sat well with employees.

   The CEO’s handling of the company’s forthcoming streaming service
   hasn’t helped matters. In 2018, Stankey hastily announced a planned
   three-tiered direct-to-consumer platform at AT&T’s analyst day to the
   surprise of many within the company. Since then, WarnerMedia has
   trashed the concept entirely in favor a TV package that costs between
   $16 and $17 per month with a less expensive ad-supported option still
   being considered for a later date. Simply put, the lack of clarity and
   flip-flopping from the company is embarrassing.

   It’s fair to wonder if AT&T can properly leverage its Bad Robot lottery
   ticket.

What are the industry implications?

   To date, Bad Robot’s $500 million payday is the most lucrative overall
   deal in the game (Bad Robot’s deals in 2006 guaranteed Abrams “just”
   $55 million to $65 million, per the Times). Thanks to the proliferation
   of deep-pocketed streaming services and the arms race for content in
   entertainment, showrunner salaries have been exploding across the
   board. Top payday winners include Greg Berlanti (Warner Bros. TV, $400
   million), Ryan Murphy (Netflix, $300 million), Michael Schur (Universal
   TV, $125 million) and Shonda Rhimes ($100 million). The nine-figure
   “mega-deal” is becoming less of a momentary trend and more of an
   established business practice; Abrams’ market-resetting agreement
   furthers that economic escalation. What heights the industry could
   reach may only be known if Christopher Nolan’s Syncopy Films Inc. were
   to begin hunting for its own lucrative overall deal.

   While Abrams is now best known for his big-screen work, WarnerMedia was
   likely most motivated by what Bad Robot could provide to its upcoming
   streaming service. On the small screen, Warner Bros. TV now houses
   Abrams, Berlanti, Mindy Kaling and Ava DuVernay. The studio is also
   working on a long-term extension for Chuck Lorre. That is a serious
   roster of content creators that should be able to line WarnerMedia’s
   over-the-top platform with attractive original programming. Similar to
   Disney acquiring Fox mainly to compete with Netflix, think of
   WarnerMedia and Bad Robot’s deal as a signal that the streaming wars
   are now a full-blown blood bath.

22 DeepMind Rearchers Among Hundreds Calling to Ban Autonomous Weapons In
Open Letter

The letter describes them as "the third revolution in warfare, after
gunpowder and nuclear arms"

   Hundreds of computer scientists, engineers, academics, futurists and
   concerned citizens have penned their signatures on an open letter
   warning of the dangers of military robots and urging a ban on their
   development. The Future of Life Institute is officially announcing the
   letter today at the International Joint Conference on Artificial
   Intelligence 2015 conference.

   Watch Google’s DeepMind AI computer dominate old Atari games

   Among the backers are some incredibly influential names; Stephen
   Hawking, Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak all signed the open letter. Other
   endorsors include the founders of DeepMind Technologies Demis Hassabis
   and Mustafa Suleyman along with 20 of the lab’s other engineers,
   developers and research scientists.

   The now Google-owned lab claims they’ve taken careful steps to assure
   their artificial intelligence technology won’t be abused. Although
   they’re making incredible strides in the field of AI research,
   they’re siding with some of the field’s experts on the issue of not
   pursuing it for autonomous military weapons. They know such weapons are
   only years (not even decades) of research away and fear that “the
   stakes are high.” Since DeepMind is one of if not the leader in AI
   research, the fact that 22 of their people signed on is huge.

   “Just as most chemists and biologists have no interest in building
   chemical or biological weapons, most AI researchers have no interest in
   building AI weapons—and do not want others to tarnish their field by
   doing so, potentially creating a major public backlash against AI that
   curtails its future societal benefits,” the letter reads.

   The letter states that autonomous weapons have been describes as “the
   third revolution in warfare, after gunpowder and nuclear arms” and
   argues it would only be a matter of time before they fall into the
   hands of terrorists, dictators and warlords who may use them for ethnic
   cleansing and to control their populace.

   “The key question for humanity today is whether to start a global AI
   arms race or to prevent it from starting. If any major military power
   pushes ahead with AI weapon development, a global arms race is
   virtually inevitable, and the endpoint of this technological trajectory
   is obvious: autonomous weapons will become the Kalashnikovs of
   tomorrow,” the letter reads.

   The letter is “open,” meaning anyone who wants to back the issue can
   add their signature. Students, writers and bus boys have all done so
   and support is keeps growing.

3 Major Questions We Have About WarnerMedia’s $500M Deal With J.J. Abrams

   By Brandon Katz • 06/18/19 10:43am

   J.J. Abrams and Katie McGrath are taking Bad Robot to WarnerMedia
   full-time. Presley Ann/Getty Images

   On Monday, it was reported that WarnerMedia is close to signing a $500
   million deal with Bad Robot, the production outfit from J.J. Abrams and
   wife Katie McGrath, following an industry-wide sweepstakes that
   included pitches from Apple, Disney, NBCUniversal, and Netflix. Abrams
   and Bad Robot Pictures have been locked into a small-screen deal with
   Warner Bros. TV since 2006. On the big screen, Abrams’ deal with
   Paramount Pictures expired last summer (Paramount ended up getting
   screwed a bit in their deal, but that’s a story for another day).

   While this new mega-deal opens up all sorts of enticing blockbuster
   opportunities for the prolific writer-producer-director (Bad Robot did
   help revive the Mission: Impossible, Star Trek and Star Wars
   franchises, after all) it also raises several key questions.

What kind of deal is WarnerMedia getting with Abrams?

   Specific details of the looming agreement remain a mystery. Under
   Paramount Pictures, Abrams had a first-look agreement which gave the
   studio the right of first refusal on any and all film projects from Bad
   Robot. However, his deal was also non-exclusive in terms of directing,
   which is why he was legally able to helm two Star Wars films for Disney
   while under contract at Paramount.

   According to The New York Times, WarnerMedia will enjoy a first-look
   deal with projects developed by Bad Robot, which will cover film, TV,
   video games, consumer products, music and digital content. Yet at this
   time, it is unknown if there is a similar non-compete clause built into
   the language of the deal. Given Paramount’s frustration with Abrams’
   lack of availability due to Star Wars, it’s hard to believe WarnerMedia
   would want him on the open market. Then again, with the abundance of
   eager suitors, Bad Robot held all the leverage.

   Bad Robot may soon be under the WarnerMedia umbrella, but it is
   believed that it is still free to work on existing outside TV projects
   such as the three series it has in development for Apple’s upcoming
   streaming service. Bad Robot boasts more than 50 movies and shows in
   development or production at the moment, per IMDBpro.

Can AT&T properly leverage this win?

   Wells Fargo analysts downgraded AT&T’s outlook last summer as its Time
   Warner acquisition represented a massive $85.4 billion investment into
   foreign business. While the former Time Warner has plenty of experience
   creating original programming, AT&T does not. The ongoing melding of
   commerce and art will be a difficult transition for both entities, and
   analysts at the time of the deal’s approval expressed concern that the
   telecom conglomerate now had too many “balls to juggle.”

   AT&T currently has $171 billion in debt, though CEO Randall Stephenson
   has pledged to correct this by 2022. At the same time, WarnerMedia is
   widely expected to reclaim exclusive broadcasting rights to popular
   library content such as Friends, which Netflix is licensing for a hefty
   $100 million throughout 2019, at the end of the year.

   Further denting confidence in AT&T is the tumultuous first year of the
   newly formed WarnerMedia. Since AT&T gained control of Time Warner
   following a drawn out battle against the Department of Justice, several
   key executives have fled the company. CEO Jeff Bewkes departed last
   June with Turner CEO John Martin. In February, HBO CEO Richard Plepler
   stepped down and Warner Bros. Entertainment CEO Kevin Tsujihara
   resigned after admitting to an inappropriate relationship with an
   actress. CNBC also reports that WarnerMedia head John Stankey’s
   leadership style hasn’t always sat well with employees.

   The CEO’s handling of the company’s forthcoming streaming service
   hasn’t helped matters. In 2018, Stankey hastily announced a planned
   three-tiered direct-to-consumer platform at AT&T’s analyst day to the
   surprise of many within the company. Since then, WarnerMedia has
   trashed the concept entirely in favor a TV package that costs between
   $16 and $17 per month with a less expensive ad-supported option still
   being considered for a later date. Simply put, the lack of clarity and
   flip-flopping from the company is embarrassing.

   It’s fair to wonder if AT&T can properly leverage its Bad Robot lottery
   ticket.

What are the industry implications?

   To date, Bad Robot’s $500 million payday is the most lucrative overall
   deal in the game (Bad Robot’s deals in 2006 guaranteed Abrams “just”
   $55 million to $65 million, per the Times). Thanks to the proliferation
   of deep-pocketed streaming services and the arms race for content in
   entertainment, showrunner salaries have been exploding across the
   board. Top payday winners include Greg Berlanti (Warner Bros. TV, $400
   million), Ryan Murphy (Netflix, $300 million), Michael Schur (Universal
   TV, $125 million) and Shonda Rhimes ($100 million). The nine-figure
   “mega-deal” is becoming less of a momentary trend and more of an
   established business practice; Abrams’ market-resetting agreement
   furthers that economic escalation. What heights the industry could
   reach may only be known if Christopher Nolan’s Syncopy Films Inc. were
   to begin hunting for its own lucrative overall deal.

   While Abrams is now best known for his big-screen work, WarnerMedia was
   likely most motivated by what Bad Robot could provide to its upcoming
   streaming service. On the small screen, Warner Bros. TV now houses
   Abrams, Berlanti, Mindy Kaling and Ava DuVernay. The studio is also
   working on a long-term extension for Chuck Lorre. That is a serious
   roster of content creators that should be able to line WarnerMedia’s
   over-the-top platform with attractive original programming. Similar to
   Disney acquiring Fox mainly to compete with Netflix, think of
   WarnerMedia and Bad Robot’s deal as a signal that the streaming wars
   are now a full-blown blood bath.
