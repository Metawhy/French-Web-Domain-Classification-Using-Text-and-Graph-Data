A WINDOW TO THE WORLD

   In today’s world, speaking one language is not enough. And with an
   estimated 750 million speakers by the year 2050, French is set to
   become the world’s most widely spoken language.

A CAREER ASSET

   Both a working and an official language of international institutions
   such as the U.N. and U.N.E.S.C.O., French is essential for anyone
   considering a career in international relations. It is also useful for
   careers in engineering, automotive industries, luxury goods or
   aeronautics.

   Switzerland, Canada, Mauritius or New Caledonia!
