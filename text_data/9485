MEX-CULTURE

Multimedia libraries indexing for the preservation and dissemination of the
Mexican culture, 2012-2016

   Given the importance of cultural heritage content in promoting
   diversity in a globalized world, making this content quickly available
   to a broad audience is a critical issue. Large volumes of such content
   must be indexed and users must be provided with means for a fast and
   easy access to the multimedia information, making them able to browse
   (according to multiple criteria) and visualize desirable content stored
   in the archives. This requires automatic indexing, whose two main
   principles emerged in the early 1990s. First, the audiovisual content
   itself is used as basis for indexing. Second, content is processed in
   the compressed form in order to save the computational cost of
   decompressing the videos. The MEX-CULTURE project aimed to:
    1. Devise, with bilateral research efforts, new automated methods for
       large-scale processing and indexing of multimedia content. These
       methods concern video indexing directly performed on encoded visual
       content, audio indexing using descriptors issued from speech
       recognition and speaker identification, cross-media indexing
       (image, video, audio and speech), scalable search and retrieval.
       The resulting techniques were implemented in a common development
       platform.
    2. Support the preservation and dissemination of Mexican Culture by
       applying the methods devised in the project to the large databases
       of Canal Once, of the FONOTECA NACIONAL (National Sound Archive of
       Mexico, part of CONACULTA, National Council for Culture and the
       Arts of Mexico) and the Video library (TVUNAM) of the UNAM
       (National Autonomous University of Mexico). MEX-CULTURE was the
       first multimedia indexing project with these characteristics.

   This project was conducted by five organizations, three from France
   (CEDRIC-Cnam, LABRI and INA) and two from Mexico (UNAM, IPN) and it is
   jointly financed by the ANR (France) and the CONACYT (Mexico).

   The video below provides a brief presentation, in French, of a
   preliminary version of the Mex-Culture platform:

   Final report of the project (May 2016).
