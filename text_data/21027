Lemon & poppy seed madeleines with a lemon glaze

   October 3, 2019 2 Comments

   I have taken the best madeleine recipe I know and added lemon and poppy
   seeds to the mix because I absolutely love this combination of flavour.
   They are the perfect little snack to whip up for tea and bake in 10
   minutes flat. The batter is made by hand in one bowl so nothing is
   easier than this.

Lemon & poppy seed madeleines with a lemon glaze

   October 3, 2019 2 Comments

   I have taken the best madeleine recipe I know and added lemon and poppy
   seeds to the mix because I absolutely love this combination of flavour.
   They are the perfect little snack to whip up for tea and bake in 10
   minutes flat. The batter is made by hand in one bowl so nothing is
   easier than this.

Lemon & poppy seed madeleines with a lemon glaze

   October 3, 2019 2 Comments

   I have taken the best madeleine recipe I know and added lemon and poppy
   seeds to the mix because I absolutely love this combination of flavour.
   They are the perfect little snack to whip up for tea and bake in 10
   minutes flat. The batter is made by hand in one bowl so nothing is
   easier than this.

Lemon & poppy seed madeleines with a lemon glaze

   October 3, 2019 2 Comments

   I have taken the best madeleine recipe I know and added lemon and poppy
   seeds to the mix because I absolutely love this combination of flavour.
   They are the perfect little snack to whip up for tea and bake in 10
   minutes flat. The batter is made by hand in one bowl so nothing is
   easier than this.

   Theses cherry meringue tartlets were the cover of my second cookbook
   sweet and I absolutely adore them. Pastry work can be a little
   daunting, but if you follow a few simple steps it’s pretty easy. I love
   cherry-based desserts and frozen cherries are readily available all
   year round and I store them in the freezer as a staple. I’ve added
   almond flour to the pastry and used toasted almond flakes because the
   flavour complements the cherries so beautifully. The amaretto adds a
   further almond note while the kirsch intensifies the cherry flavour,
   but both are optional. A good splash of booze in a dessert tends to
   only make it better.
