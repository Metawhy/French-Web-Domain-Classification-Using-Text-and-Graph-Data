Welcome to Alliance Francaise Hyderabad

   Alliance Française of Hyderabad has a long history of its own. The
   connection between France, the city and its adjoining areas goes few
   centuries back and it is growing strong. Thanks to its welcoming,
   competent and dedicated team, it also has a bright future.

   Teaching French language to our students keeping up with the best
   international standards is our first mission. Teachers in Hyderabad has
   been constantly ensuring that the city remains a major center of
   Francophony. Thanks to Bordeaux Nouvelle Aquitaine, Hyderabad has also
   a direct connection with one of the most dynamic and beautiful regions
   of France.

   Alliance Françaises are platforms for artistic, cultural and
   intellectual dialogues around the world. Along with our partners such
   as the Department of Language & Culture of the Government of Telangana,
   Krishnakriti Foundation, the Goethe Zentrum, Quadir Ali Baig Theatre
   Foundation, Phoenix Arena, the various art societies and all the artist
   community of Telangana, we are looking forward to exciting programs.

   Today’s world calls for a multidimensional understanding of society.
   While high technology is redefining many parameters of our lives, the
   prime and outmost importance of ecological balance is coming back to
   the fore. Both call for a new look to cultural, and artistic forms. Let
   us explore the ways to be active players. Hyderabad is the right place!

   Samuel Berthet, Director
