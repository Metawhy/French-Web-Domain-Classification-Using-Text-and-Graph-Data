   Bordeaux, place de la bourse

Welcome

   The videos of the presentations are available on the ACM website.

   The EuroSys conference series brings together professionals from
   academia and industry. It has a strong focus on systems research and
   development: operating systems, data base systems, real-time systems
   and middleware for networked, distributed, parallel, or embedded
   computing systems. EuroSys has become a premier forum for discussing
   various issues of systems software research and development, including
   implications related to hardware and applications.

   EuroSys’15 will follow the pattern established by the previous EuroSys
   conferences, by seeking papers on all aspects of computer systems.
   EuroSys’15 will also include a number of workshops to allow junior and
   senior members of the systems community to explore leading-edge topics
   and ideas before they are presented at a conference.
