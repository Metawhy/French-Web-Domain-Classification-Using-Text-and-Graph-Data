Compassion-First owner to acquire National Veterinary Associates

JAB expands its veterinary hospital holdings with the purchase from two other
investors.

   Compassion-First owner to acquire National Veterinary Associates

   One of the largest animal hospital chains, National Veterinary
   Associates, is getting a new owner.

   Ares Management Corp. and partner OMERS Private Equity have agreed to
   sell majority control of the 670-hospital network to another group, JAB
   Investors. Terms were not disclosed.

   Earlier in 2019, JAB Investors bought its way into the veterinary
   industry with the $1.2 billion purchase of Compassion-First Pet
   Hospitals, which at the time operated 41 specialty, emergency and
   general practices and today has 42.

   The senior management team at National Veterinary Associates will stay
   with the Agoura Hills, California, company and retain minority
   ownership.

   The NVA portfolio includes more than 670 general, specialty and
   emergency practices and 70 pet resorts in the United States, Canada,
   Australia and New Zealand.

   “We are proud to have supported the company during its significant
   growth over the past five years as it extended its reach outside the
   U.S., accelerated its acquisitions, invested in new pet segments such
   as pet resorts, and became the largest independent veterinary platform
   globally,” said Ares Management co-founder Bennett Rosenthal, MBA.

   NVA’s CEO, Greg Hartmann, MBA, said the chain isn’t done expanding.

   “Moving forward, we feel JAB Investors will be a great partner for us
   as we focus on our next phase of growth,” he said. “They are strong
   supporters of our mission of providing progressive and compassionate
   care. They share our belief that the best veterinary care is created by
   supporting and empowering our animal care teams in their local
   communities.”

   National Veterinary Associates was founded in 1996 by Stanley R.
   Creighton, DVM, DACVIM.
