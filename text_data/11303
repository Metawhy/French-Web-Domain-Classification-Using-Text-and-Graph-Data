Meet the Team: Animation

   It’s been a while since our last update, but we are back with something
   a bit different… While our adventure goes on and we keep creating new
   elements to make ZHEROS great, we decided to introduce you to the
   brains and muscles behind the game. Let’s kick this off with a very
   unusual guy: our animator, Mr. Napalm.

   As his name says, he’s an “explosive” person, funny and original, and
   his creativity is almost limitless.

   It’s time to meet him!
