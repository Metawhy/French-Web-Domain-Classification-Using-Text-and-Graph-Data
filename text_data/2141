The tortoise is collateral damage in the Mojave Desert

Large solar arrays can harm threatened species.

   Peter Laufer Opinion March 19, 2014

   Which should come first: protecting the threatened desert tortoise or
   creating expensive electricity for an already overpopulated California?

   The Obama administration and global players in the solar power industry
   have chosen electricity, and in order to so they are defiling the
   Mojave Desert with a massive project that turns the sun’s rays into
   juice for air conditioners in Los Angeles.

   In February, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz flipped the on-switch at
   what’s now the largest solar farm in the world, the Ivanpah Solar
   Electric Generating System.  “This project speaks for itself,” said
   Secretary Moniz as he dedicated the facility.  “Just look at the
   170,000 shining heliostat mirrors and the three towers that would dwarf
   the Statue of Liberty.”

   I have looked at those mirrors and towers while conducting research for
   the Turtle Conservancy.  Like gigantic watchtowers, the supports for
   the boilers loom some 40 stories over the desert, looking out over the
   sprawling lake of reflecting mirrors.  For those of us who treasure the
   desert as wild and seemingly limitless, the effect is much like
   transplanting crowded refineries from New Jersey to the Mojave.

   The numbers cited by the Ivanpah plant operator are impressive.  All
   those mirrors are spread across 5 square miles at the California-Nevada
   border alongside the freeway that connects Las Vegas with Los
   Angeles.  The mirrors focus the sun’s rays on boilers in the
   460-foot-tall towers, heating water to 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit in
   order to create the steam needed to spin turbines that can generate
   enough electricity for 140,000 homes.

   There are numbers, however, that the Google-backed, $2.2 billion
   developer, BrightSource, does not like to brag about. That includes the
   high price of the electricity Ivanpah sells to the grid and the several
   score desert tortoises that have been its victims, despite over $50
   million spent to relocate the animals.  Add to that a $1.6
   billion-dollar federal loan guarantee for BrightSource, plus the
   priceless loan of publicly owned land for the project.

   At first blush, electricity from the sun and a threatened species seem
   like green allies. But the Ivanpah project encroaches on land that the
   desert tortoise has called home for millennia.  The official reptile of
   both Nevada and California, Gopherus agassizii, is a survivor.  It
   lives as long as humans do and weathers the triple-digit Mojave summers
   by burrowing deep in the desert sand.  But it’s no match for
   encroaching development. Military exercises, dune buggies, grazing
   livestock and now solar farms devastate the tortoise’s fragile habitat,
   killing the grasses and cacti it eats.  Since 1950, the species’
   population has collapsed by some 90 percent.

   “Translocation is a terrible idea,” one of the biologists hired to try
   to save tortoises at the construction site told me, requesting
   anonymity because unauthorized contact with journalists violates
   BrightSource’s rules for the scientists it employs.

   “Everybody knows that translocation doesn’t work.  When you’re walking
   in front of a bulldozer, crying, and moving animals and cacti out of
   the way, it’s hard to think that the project is a good idea.”

   It’s not just tortoises dying.  During tests of the power plant before
   last week’s official opening, dead and injured birds with scorched
   feathers were found at the site. Bird biologists think the animals were
   burned while trying to fly through the intense heat directed at the
   towers. Biologists believe that the dead birds mistook mirrors at
   Ivanpah and other solar-power sites for bodies of water.

   Although it’s too late for the desert tortoises that once lived at the
   Ivanpah site, economics and technology could save their cousins.  Huge,
   expensive and complex solar-powered electric generating stations like
   Ivanpah look less appealing as rooftop solar collectors become more
   cost-effective.  Nevertheless, other Ivanpah-size power plants are
   already under construction or on the drawing boards, though they are
   sited far from where electricity is needed.

   These large solar arrays need to be scrapped.  It’s time to stop
   wrecking the wilderness with government-supported waste when the sun
   can be harnessed efficiently right from the tops of the buildings where
   we use the electricity.
