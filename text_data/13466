Thomas p. Peschak

   Thomas P. Peschak is an assignment photographer for National Geographic
   Magazine. He is a Founding/Associate Director of the Manta Trust, and a
   senior fellow of the International League of Conservation
   Photographers. He has been named as one of the 40 most influential
   nature photographers in the world.

   Originally trained as a marine biologist specializing in human–wildlife
   conflict, he retired from science fieldwork in 2004. He became an
   wildlife photojournalist after realizing that he could have a greater
   conservation impact through photographs than statistics. His work
   focuses on some of the most critical marine conservation issues of our
   time.

   Thomas has written and photographed five books: Currents of Contrast,
   Great White Shark, Wild Seas Secret Shores and Lost World. His latest
   book Sharks and People was released in 2013 and chronicles the
   relationship between people and sharks around the world.

   He is a multiple winner in the BBC Wildlife Photographer of the Year
   Awards and received World Press Photo Awards for his work in2011 and
   2013. In 2015, he gave a TED talk, Dive into an ocean photographer’s
   world, aboard Mission Blue II, hosted by TED Prize winner Sylvia Earle.

   Thomas is a speaker for the National Geographic Live! Series and
   presented his talk, Wild Seas, Secret Shores in Australia and
   Singapore.
