   William Sahlman is a Baker Foundation Professor of Business
   Administration at Harvard Business School.

   Mr. Sahlman received an A.B. degree in Economics from Princeton
   University (1972), an M.B.A. from Harvard University (1975), and a
   Ph.D. in Business Economics (1982), also from Harvard.  He joined the
   Harvard Business School faculty in 1980.

   His research focuses on the investment and financing decisions made in
   entrepreneurial ventures at all stages in their development. Mr.
   Sahlman has written numerous articles and two textbooks on topics
   including entrepreneurial management, venture capital, private equity,
   deal structuring, incentives, commercializing science, impact
   investing, and the role of entrepreneurship in the global economy.

   In 1985, Mr. Sahlman introduced a new second-year elective course
   called Entrepreneurial Finance. Over 8,000 students have taken that
   course since it was first offered. In 2000, Mr. Sahlman helped design
   and introduce The Entrepreneurial Manager, a required course in the
   First Year MBA curriculum.  Mr. Sahlman has published over 200 cases
   and notes for classroom use.

   From 2007 to 2016, Mr. Sahlman was Senior Associate Dean for External
   Relations.  He is co-chair of the Rock Center for Entrepreneurship.  He
   was co-chair of the Entrepreneurial Management Unit from 1999 to 2002.
   From 1991 to 1999, he was Senior Associate Dean, Director of Publishing
   Activities, and chairman of the board for Harvard Business School
   Publishing Corporation. From 1990 to 1991, he was chairman of the
   Harvard University Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility.
   From 2009 to 2015, he was chairman of the Advisory Committee for
   Harvard Stem Cell Science.  He is a member of the board of advisors or
   board of directors of several private companies.  In 2011, Mr. Sahlman
   participated in The IPO Task Force, a private group focused on
   regulatory reform of the initial public offering process.  The Task
   Force published a report called: Rebuilding the IPO On-Ramp: Putting
   Emerging Growth Companies and the Job Market Back on the Road to
   Growth.

   In April 2011, the National Venture Capital Association gave Mr.
   Sahlman The American Spirit Award, which was created in 1999 "to
   recognize individuals who have shown outstanding leadership by applying
   business skills, knowledge, expertise and resources to make a
   meaningful contribution to society."

       Leslie Berlin, Troublemakers: Silicon Valley's Coming of Age
       William A. Sahlman
       Leslie Berlin's book Troublemakers, is an engaging and insightful
       people-first exploration of the roots of Silicon Valley, from the
       late 1960s to the early 1980s. Berlin portrays seven individuals
       who played important roles at critical junctures in the development
       of technologies we now take for granted: the Internet; personal,
       connected computing and communications devices; genetic
       engineering; software as a service (SAAS); streaming video;
       massively multiplayer online games; and democratized access to the
       world's information. They helped lay the foundation for the
       economic powerhouse called Silicon Valley.

       A case study is presented concerning a nonprofit organization that
       helps entrepreneurs in emerging-markets countries in regions
       including Latin America and Asia, focusing on the decision over
       whether to expand its services into the Miami, Florida, area, a
       question on which the two co-founders of the organization disagree.
       It presents perspectives on the case from nonprofit executive Linda

       Reviving Entrepreneurship
       Josh Lerner and William Sahlman
       New enterprises don't exist in a vacuum: They rise or fall
       depending on myriad contextual factors, all of them interrelated,
       and all of them affected by government policy. U.S. lawmakers must
       carefully consider the effects of interventions in at least 12
       areas, ranging from capital markets to tax treatment to
       intellectual property to health care. Their decisions could shore
       up—or further weaken—what has long been America's greatest economic
       asset.

       Management and the Financial Crisis (We Have Met the Enemy and He
       Is Us...)
       William A. Sahlman
       The financial crisis of 2008-2009 has revealed that our broad model
       of corporate governance is broken, independent of the shortcomings
       in the regulatory system. Managers and boards of directors in
       scores of systemically important firms failed to protect employees,
       customers, or shareholders, and placed the global financial system
       at risk. I assert that the root cause of the crisis can be found in
       five related systems: incentives, risk management and control,
       accounting, human capital, and culture. The worst firms had lethal
       combinations of strong incentives, weak control and risk
       management, flawed internal and external accounting, low skill
       and/or low integrity people, and corrosive cultures. Piecemeal
       attempts to fix elements of corporate governance will fail. The
       problem, to illustrate, is not just the structure of compensation.
       Nor will increasing required capital prevent problems at companies
       with strong incentives and weak controls. I believe that we may
       need a new kind of external agency for systemically risky firms
       that would take a holistic look at the five systems to identify
       weaknesses, make recommendations to managers and boards, and set
       regulatory policies, including assessing charges for insuring
       against losses. Without such a comprehensive assessment and
       improvement plan, boards cannot do their jobs, and the system will
       remain as subject to calamitous events as it was before the crisis.

       Management and the Financial Crisis (We have met the enemy and he
       is us...)
       William A. Sahlman
       The financial crisis of 2008-9 has revealed that our broad model of
       corporate governance is broken, independent of the shortcomings in
       the regulatory system. Managers and boards of directors in scores
       of systemically important firms failed to protect employees,
       customers, or shareholders, and placed the global financial system
       at risk. I assert that the root cause of the crisis can be found in
       five related systems: incentives; risk management and control;
       accounting; human capital; and culture. The worst firms had lethal
       combinations of strong incentives, weak control and risk
       management, flawed internal and external accounting, low skill
       and/or low integrity people, and corrosive cultures. Piecemeal
       attempts to fix elements of corporate governance will fail. The
       problem, to illustrate, is not just the structure of compensation.
       Nor will increasing required capital prevent problems at companies
       with strong incentives and weak controls. I believe that we may
       need a new kind of external agency for systemically risky firms
       that would take a holistic look at the five systems to identify
       weaknesses, make recommendations to managers and boards, and set
       regulatory policies, including assessing charges for insuring
       against losses. Without such a comprehensive assessment and
       improvement plan, boards cannot do their jobs, and the system will
       remain as subject to calamitous events as it was before the crisis.

    4. Case | HBS Case Collection | October 2018 (Revised May 2019)
       Khan Academy 2018
       William Sahlman and Nicole Tempest Keller
       Founded in 2008, Khan Academy was a global educational nonprofit
       with a mission to provide a free, world-class education for anyone
       anywhere in the world. By 2018, the organization had expanded into
       numerous content areas, product areas, and geographic markets.
       However, a newly minted 3-year strategic plan called for greater
       focus and prioritization to enable the young organization to
       maximize its impact. It also called for increased fundraising
       efforts to ensure long-term sustainability. The case poses several
       questions: How can the organization balance its far-reaching
       aspirational vision for transforming education globally with the
       short-term need for greater focus? Would the priorities set in the
       strategic plan enable Khan Academy to create systemic global
       change? How should donors evaluate the attractiveness and impact of
       a potential investment in Khan Academy relative to other
       organizations in the educational market? Was Khan Academy on the
       right path to ensuring long-term sustainability? What should Khan
       Academy’s management team do?

       NOWaccount
       Ramana Nanda, William A. Sahlman and Lauren Barley
       It was September 2013, and NOWaccount Network Corporation (NOW®)
       co-founders John Hayes and Lara Hodgson were putting the final
       touches on the presentation deck for their annual shareholders'
       meeting. Along with co-founder Stacey Abrams, the pair had designed
       NOW's business model three years ago, and the company was at a
       critical juncture. NOW offered a program—called NOWaccount—that
       provided working capital to small businesses by converting their
       trade receivables almost immediately into cash. Founded in December
       2010, Atlanta, Georgia-based NOW was serving clients in nine
       states. With 2013 year-to-date revenue of roughly $100,000, NOW was
       financed with $2.5 million of founder, and friends and family
       equity.
       NOW's wholly-owned, not-for-profit special purpose entity (SPE),
       Trade Credit Guaranty Corporation (TCGC), purchased approved
       receivables, funding 90% of the invoice face values by electronic
       transfers into clients' bank accounts. As of September 2013, TCGC
       had purchased more than $13 million of small business trade
       receivables from more than 40 clients. Once TCGC reached a scale of
       approximately $150 million of funds in use for receivable
       purchases, the co-founders planned to tap into the securitization
       market for capital by issuing asset-backed securities (ABS),
       collateralized by a pool of receivables, much like the credit card
       industry. ABS would provide TCGC ongoing capital at a lower cost.
       The question the co-founders confronted was whether they should get
       to the $150 million securitization threshold by piecing together
       smaller pools of capital from credit unions and possibly smaller
       banks (a slower approach but one that did not involve dilution
       because it was all debt finance), or by accepting larger chunks of
       capital from a major global bank and a private equity firm, getting
       them much closer to the threshold but at the cost of significant
       dilution (35%) as these financiers were also looking for a
       combination of equity and warrants in NOW. As they prepared to
       discuss their options at the shareholders' meeting, Hayes and
       Hodgson considered each option's trade-offs in timing, cost,
       control, and execution risk.

       Rubicon Global
       William A. Sahlman and Hunter Ashmore
       The case describes Rubicon Global, a startup that aimed to disrupt
       the waste management industry. The company started with a bold
       idea: create a cloud-based, full-service waste management company
       providing low-cost, highly efficient, and environmentally friendly
       service anywhere in the country through a national network of
       independent waste haulers and recyclers. A player in the sharing
       economy, Rubicon was developing an on-demand mobile application
       that did for waste management what Uber had done for taxi service.
       Rubicon had made great progress since introducing its service. They
       had signed up large multi-national customers and had a number of
       large potential contracts in the negotiation phase. The team needed
       more capital to build out the network and technology platform.
       Management and the board had to make a number of critical
       decisions: how much should the company raise, for what purpose,
       from whom, and on what terms?

       BOLT: Seed Venture Capital Firm
       William A. Sahlman and Robert F. White
       BOLT is a different kind of seed venture capital firm built to
       serve the needs of early-stage startups at the intersection of
       hardware and software.
       In the past decade, the cost of entrepreneurial experimentation has
       dropped dramatically, particularly in web and mobile applications.
       Teams can generate and test hypotheses quickly and efficiently.
       What used to take millions of dollars and years can now be
       accomplished with thousands of dollars and in a matter of months.
       As a result, the rate of exploration has exploded. The drop in the
       cost of creating and testing such ventures has resulted in the
       formation of new kinds of venture investment firms. A prominent
       example is the accelerator or incubator. These firms evaluate
       hundreds of proposals, choose a small number of teams, and then
       provide help, mentorship, a little capital, and access to networks
       in return for a share of the equity.
       More recently, there have been a number of parallel changes in the
       world of hardware-based ventures. Important factors include:
       • low cost but powerful design and simulation software
       • versatile, inexpensive 3D printing technology
       • access to high quality, low cost manufacturing capabilities in
       places like China
       Almost every hardware venture incorporates software and data
       capture, transmission, and interpretation, all of which benefit
       from the trends described earlier. Unlike pure software ventures,
       companies that have important hardware components need access to
       expensive and complicated machinery, ranging from lathes to printed
       circuit board prototyping equipment. These companies also need
       expertise in operating this equipment and transitioning from
       prototypes to final products.
       Ben Einstein, Axel Bichara, and Scott Miller, the founders of BOLT,
       recognized this trend and created a seed venture firm focused on
       the unique needs of these ventures and entrepreneurs. BOLT has all
       the elements required to design, develop, prototype, test, and make
       ready for manufacture novel combinations of hardware and software.
       They have equipment, skilled staff, and access to experienced
       mentors and networks that can help ventures accomplish more in less
       time and with less money than would otherwise be possible. They
       provide a place and process to help create the next generation of
       independent hardware companies. In addition, they provide financial
       and investment advice and coaching to their portfolio company
       management teams.
       Einstein was a product design and development guru, Bichara was an
       entrepreneur-turned-venture capitalist and Miller was an expert in
       engineering and manufacturing. They closed on a $4 million fund in
       early 2013 and opened a space in downtown Boston that contained a
       remarkable array of equipment and talent to attract and nurture
       high potential ventures.
       This multimedia case offers insights into the BOLT team, the
       facilities, the process and a few of the ventures that chose to
       work with BOLT. It also provides insights into the evolving world
       of entrepreneurship and venture capital. The case focuses on the
       founders' decision to raise a second fund and expand to a second
       location.

       Maricopa, Inc.: Finding the Right Treatment for Growth
       William A. Sahlman, Thomas R. Eisenmann, Joseph B. Fuller and
       Shikhar Ghosh
       The founders of Maricopa, Inc., a startup that sold proprietary
       hair-care products directly to salons, were preparing a board
       presentation to address the young company's inability to meet
       financial projections. While the products had caught on with
       customers, the financial shortcomings raised some questions about
       the company's business plan. The company had gone through much of
       its cash and needed additional funding to continue operating.
       At the same time, two VC investors were deciding how to proceed
       with their investments in Maricopa. The larger VC firm questioned
       Maricopa's management's decisions and was hesitant to further fund
       the company. However the Maricopa investment was much more
       important to the smaller VC firm, and its representative on
       Maricopa's board worked hard to convince her counterpart from the
       larger firm that while the firm had struggled, it was a young
       startup with strong potential. Without the larger firm investing
       again in Maricopa, the business was at risk of going under.

       Endeavor: Miami Heats Up
       William A. Sahlman, Ramana Nanda, David Lane and Lisa Mazzanti
       Endeavor Global was a nonprofit that for 15 years had worked to
       nurture entrepreneurship in emerging markets by selecting local
       high-impact entrepreneurs for mentoring and aid in scaling up their
       businesses from committed local business leaders. In summer 2012,
       Endeavor received an invitation to replicate its model in Miami,
       Florida, and the Endeavor board was meeting to debate the value of
       such a move. At issue were questions of organizational mission and
       the relevance of Miami, as well as branding, funding, and focus.
       The invitation had come in the midst of a major expansion effort by
       Endeavor into new emerging markets and threatened to disrupt those
       efforts and tax a new hybrid funding model which Endeavor was
       implementing. Founder Linda Rottenberg, with the support of her
       board, must determine the implications of possibly opening in Miami
       on Endeavor's resources and mission. How could Rottenberg justify
       to overseas affiliates a choice to invest in a first-world city?

       Iora Health
       William A. Sahlman and Vineeta Vijayaraghavan
       The Iora Health case looks at a new approach to the management and
       delivery of primary care. Instead of having a doctor, half a nurse
       and two accountants, Iora deploys a doctor, a nurse and several
       health coaches, all operating as an integrated team. Iora focuses
       on measuring and improving health. They are paid to manage a
       population rather than on a fee for service basis. They spend twice
       as much on primary care and hope to save over 20% on total care by
       improving health and obviating the need for acute interventions.
       The action question in the cases revolves around a proposed
       financing for the company at a time when several locations are up
       and running but the model has not been fully validated.

       A Simple Free Cash Flow Valuation Model
       William A. Sahlman
       Explores some of the issues involved in valuing cash flow streams.
       A simple model is presented that reveals the effect on value of
       changing assumptions about the appropriate discount rate, the level
       of profitability, the growth rate of sales, the asset intensity
       ratio, and the leverage ratio. Helps students address some of the
       following issues: 1) What is the definition of cash flow? 2) What
       effects do changes in the discount rate have on valuation? 3) How
       sensitive is value to changes in assumptions about the underlying
       characteristics of the cash flow stream? 4) How does growth affect
       value? 5) How does the use of leverage affect value? 6) What are
       price-to-earnings ratios? and 7) What factors affect
       price-to-earnings ratios?

       TerraPower
       William A. Sahlman, Ramana Nanda, Joseph B. Lassiter III and James
       McQuade
       John Gilleland, CEO of TerraPower, returned to his office after a
       lengthy meeting with potential investors. It was October 2012, and
       TerraPower was in the process of raising a $200M Series C round to
       finance the ongoing development of its next-generation nuclear
       reactor. Though early in the fundraising process, Gilleland noted
       that this most recent conversation was similar to conversations
       with other interested cleantech growth equity investors. The
       conversations circled around a common theme: "This is the biggest
       idea that's ever been presented at our partners' meeting. We love
       what you're doing, but it's not right for us as an investment."
       Outside of raising money from typical growth equity and
       infrastructure funds, Gilleland could partner with a government
       and/or form a joint venture with an existing nuclear power player.
       Reliance Industries as an investor in TerraPower could provide an
       entry point into the fast growing Indian market. At the same time,
       Gilleland and Gates had talked with China National Nuclear Corp.
       about a possible cooperation with TerraPower. Whom should Gilleland

       In the three years since Bishop and Button purchased Verengo in a
       leveraged buyout (LBO), the company had gone through dramatic
       changes. Initially a residential windows and insulation firm, after
       the economic recession of 2008 the company switched gears and began
       offering solar installations to local residential customers. Aided
       by favorable regulatory changes and a consumer financing
       partnership, Verengo's solar business took off and became the
       company's primary focus. By the end of 2010, Verengo had grown to
       $27 million in revenue and was the largest solar integrator in
       Southern California. In December 2010, Verengo raised $9.7 million
       in growth equity funding and was considering its options for future
       growth. Eager to expand to markets outside of Southern California,
       Bishop and Button knew that they had to carefully assess the firm's
       many opportunities and tightly manage its growth.

       Khosla Ventures: Biofuels Strategy
       Joseph B. Lassiter III, William A. Sahlman and Alison Berkley
       Wagonfeld
       By 2008, a number of the firm's early cleantech investments were
       showing promise, and the companies were starting to need
       significantly more money to create the massive scale required in
       the energy sector. As Khosla thought about the hundreds of millions
       of dollars required by his portfolio companies, he wondered how he
       should position his firm at this stage of development. Should
       Khosla develop a new fund that focused on later-stage investments?
       Should he seek investments from large industry players such as the

       Risk and Reward in Venture Capital
       William A. Sahlman
       This note describes the payoff structure of investment in
       individual venture capital–backed companies and in venture capital
       portfolios. Venture Capital investments are characterized by high
       failure rate (0ver 50%) and a small number of given successes
       (greater than 10% returns). As an asset, class, venture capital has
       produced high cyclical returns that mirror trends in capital
       markets and in markets for new technology. There is a large
       disparity in median and upper quantize performance. A small number
       of funds do well on a constant basis. Overall returns on venture
       capital have been low for the decade ending in 2009. ?????

       Bling Nation, a Palo Alto, CA startup, was founded in 2007 as a
       mobile payment service provider that bypassed industry participants
       such as Visa and MasterCard. Bling Nation partnered with local
       community banks and merchants in small towns. The banks provided
       their consumers with Bling Nation “tags”—microchip stickers that
       could be placed on any mobile phone device. The tags allowed users
       to make payments directly from their checking accounts and
       functioned similarly to a debit card. While Bling Nation had
       already raised $33 million, and its founders were confident of the
       market potential for mobile payments, they recognized the
       challenges they faced in scaling their current business model.

       NovoCure Ltd.
       William A. Sahlman and Sarah Flaherty
       Venture capitalist William Doyle must raise $35 million for a
       portfolio company with a promising, novel cancer therapy, just as
       global capital markets are imploding in the fall of 2008. NovoCure,
       Ltd., has developed an electrical-field-based therapy, called Tumor
       Treating fields, for the treatment of cancerous tumors. The therapy
       has shown significant efficacy with no side effects after five
       years of testing in human patients. Doyle believes NovoCure has the
       potential to become an important company with a major new cancer
       therapy platform but must complete pivotal (Phase III) clinical
       trials and receive FDA approval. Doyle's venture capital firm, WFD
       Ventures, has invested $25 million in three rounds to fund pilot
       clinical trials for glioblastoma and other non-small cell lung
       cancer, and the first pivotal clinical trial for glioblastoma.
       Additional financing is needed to proceed with the strategically
       important second pivotal trial. In the fall of 2008 Doyle was
       negotiating the final terms of an investment by two prominent hedge
       funds when the liquidity crisis caused the hedge funds to withdraw
       from the transaction. Dole must now reevaluate his options for
       securing the needed financing for this promising young company.

       William A. Sahlman and Daniel R Scherlis
       Describes a method for valuing high-risk, long-term investments
       such as those confronting venture capitalists. The method entails
       forecasting a future value (e.g., five years from the present) and
       discounting that terminal value back to the present by applying a
       high discount rate (e.g., 50%). Provides an explanation of this
       method, including a detailed discussion of the determinants of the
       key factors ranging from the discount rate to the terminal value.
       The pedagogic objective is to make students aware of the issues
       involved in valuing such "futures" investments. A model is provided
       that further elucidates the determinants of value.

       Zoots - Financing Growth (A)

       Traces the genesis and founding of Zoots, the largest chain of dry
       cleaning establishments in the U.S. Founded by some of the founders
       of the very successful Staples chain, the company raises a very
       large amount of capital without fully proving its business model,
       and by 2006 is in need of yet more funding. Pushes students to
       dissect the business model and current operations -- and their
       financial performance -- and figure out what went wrong initially,
       if the business model and operations are now on solid footing, and,
       assuming capital can be raised, whether it is better to take the
       "bird in the hand" of significant capital at an admittedly
       disappointing valuation, or wait for a strategic investor who would
       pay a higher price but will need significantly more time to
       complete due diligence.

       Michael J. Roberts, William A. Sahlman and Elizabeth Kind
       Describes a prospective "venture debt" loan to a new venture from
       the perspective of Patrick Lee, a principal at Pinnacle Ventures.
       Forces students to grapple with the nature of financial risk in the
       start-up firm and assess the prospective risks and returns to a
       lender to such a firm. To reach a perspective on these issues,
       students need to assess the existing pro forma cash flows of the
       venture backed firm, overlay the cash flow implications of a
       venture debt loan, and assess how much additional "runway" (months
       till cash runs out) the venture debt will provide. Students must
       also look at the prospective returns to the venture debt firm from
       the warrants and the option to invest in follow-on financings that
       is provided to Pinnacle as part of the loan. Thus, they must look
       at risk and return from the prospective of both parties. Also
       provides information on the returns to venture capital, venture
       debt, and other forms of private equity, and asks students to
       address the issue of what the risk and return in these various
       private equity asset classes has been and is likely to be.

       San Francisco Giants
       William A. Sahlman and Elizabeth Kind
       Larry Baer, executive vice-president and COO, was eager to improve
       profitability for the San Francisco Giants baseball team. Over the
       last few years, the Giants have had a number of successes. They
       successfully built the first privately financed ball park in over
       30 years. They set all-time records in season ticket holders,
       attendance, and sponsorship advertising. At the same time, the team
       was highly competitive in the field, ranking first or second in the
       league and making it to the World Series in 2002. However, they
       were expected to incur significant operating losses. Baer wondered
       what he should do.

       Preview Travel (A)
       William A. Sahlman, Nicole Tempest, Daniel H Case III and Robert
       Keller
       Preview Travel was a leader in the online travel industry, having
       generated $80 million in bookings in 1997 and growing at a 34%
       compound annual growth rate per quarter. This case describes the
       evolution of Preview Travel's business plan and financing strategy
       and highlights a financial turning point that the company faced in
       August 1997. In August 1997, the company was in need of an
       additional cash infusion and had received strong indications of
       interest from a major U.S. media company. However, Preview Travel
       was disappointed with the offer the media company eventually
       made--$4.50 a share--since it was significantly less than the
       Series E round a year earlier ($9.00 a share). An investment bank
       advising Preview Travel believed that Preview Travel could garner a
       higher valuation in the public market and recommended that the
       company consider an IPO as an alternative means of raising capital.
       However, there were risks to this strategy. Closes with the
       question of whether Preview Travel should accept the "sure" but low
       offer from the media company or pursue an accelerated and
       potentially risky IPO.

       At the end of 1998, Jonathan Bulkeley, the newly-named CEO of
       barnesandnoble.com, is faced with a challenge. As the second
       leading online bookseller behind Amazon.com, barnesandnoble.com
       must build its market share. With Forrester Research predicting
       that the online bookselling market would grow to $3 billion in
       2003, how could barnesandnoble.com attract more of the "newbies"
       coming onto the web to its site and become the leading online
       bookseller--as it was in the bricks-and-mortar world--over the long
       run?

       of barnesandnoble.com, wonders what his company should do next
       against Amazon.com, the online retailer who is the leading online
       book seller in the United States. While barnesandnoble.com has been
       careful to expand into new categories related to media--such as
       magazines, CDs, and posters--Amazon.com has expanded into a variety
       of seemingly unrelated categories--such as Z-shops, auctions, and
       power tools. While some see this expansion as a weakness in
       Amazon.com's branding strategy, how could Riggio and
       barnesandnoble.com best exploit this so that they become the
       leading online bookseller over the long run in terms of market
       share and mind share?

       Their experiment appears to be successful and they must design the

       Capital Market Myopia
       William A. Sahlman and Howard H. Stevenson
       Focuses attention on a phenomenon we call capital market myopia, a
       situation in which participants in the capital markets ignore the
       logical implications of their individual investment decisions.
       Viewed in isolation, each decision seems to make sense. When taken
       together, however, they are a prescription for disaster. Capital
       market myopia leads to over-funding of industries and unsustainable
       levels of valuation in the stock market. Uses the Winchester Disk
       industry to elucidate the phenomenon. Argues that capital market
       participants should have seen the problem coming. They should have
       known that valuation levels were absurd, based in large part on the
       greater fool theory. The data necessary to anticipate the problem
       were readily available before the industry shakeout began and stock
       prices collapsed. Offers some simple lessons to help investors and
       entrepreneurs avoid charter membership in the greater fool club.

       William A. Sahlman and Jason Green
       VideoGuide is emerging from a development stage start-up and
       requires a significant capital infusion to commercialize its
       product. Various financing options are considered including going
       public, venture capital, private placement, or a strategic partner.
       Given the "heated" IPO market, VideoGuide is leaning toward going
       public.

       Harris Seafoods Leveraged Buyout
       William A. Sahlman
       Describes set of issues confronting Alison Lassiter, who is trying
       to help Charlie Harris arrange a leveraged buyout of the shrimp
       company he runs, a division of a publicly traded company, Katy
       Industries. Lassiter has prepared a memorandum discussing and
       analyzing the company in detail and performed some preliminary
       analyses on the economics of the transaction. Many issues remain,
       including: 1) What is the maximum price Harris should pay? 2) How
       and when should he approach Katy with a proposal? 3) What should
       the elements of the proposal be? 4) From whom should the equity
       funds be raised and how much should be raised? 5) What lenders
       should be approached and how? 6) How should the pie be sliced?
       (i.e., What proportion should management get? The equity investors?
       The lenders?) 7) Assuming the deal can be pulled off, what will the
       critical success factors be? Presents an opportunity to hone
       analytical skills and, more important, to discuss how to manage the
       process so that a deal acceptable to all parties can be structured.
       Students may be asked to take different perspectives--management,
       lenders--and be prepared to discuss them.

       What Do Venture Capitalists Do?
       William A. Sahlman
       Presents the results derived from 49 responses to a questionnaire
       mailed to 100 venture capitalists in late 1984. The purpose of the
       survey was to shed light on the relationship between venture
       capitalists and their portfolio companies. The survey revealed that
       the venture capitalists who responded spend about half their time
       monitoring nine portfolio investments of which five are companies
       on whose boards they sit. For the latter group of companies, a
       venture capitalist typically devotes 80 hours of on-site time and
       30 hours of phone time to each company in a year. The most
       frequently performed service for portfolio companies is to help
       raise additional funds, with strategic analysis and management
       recruiting also mentioned as important roles. Finally, the venture
       capitalists in the survey had replaced an average of three CEOs
       during their careers, and considered weak senior management to be
       the dominant cause of venture failure.

       Describes a series of decisions confronting Charles Leighton,
       co-founder and chairman of the CML Group. CML is a successful
       participant in the leisure time industry with two lines of
       business: specialty retailing and recreational consumer products.
       The key issues in the case are: 1) Should CML Group go public? and
       2) How should management select an investment banking team? In
       order to address these issues, the students will have to understand
       the strategy and performance of CML, and assess the costs and
       benefits of going public in that context. Then, they will have to
       develop a strategy for selecting an underwriting team consistent
       with their analysis of the first issue.

       Contains a history of the microcomputer software industry from the
       mid-1970s through early 1982. During that period growth was
       explosive. Many new companies were formed. However, the eventual

       firms had appeared. The note is intended to provide background

    1. Innovation Corrupted: The Origins and Legacy of Enron's Collapse
       by Malcolm S. Salter
       [SALINN.jpg] Although much has already been written about the rise
       and fall of Enron, four important questions remain unanswered: What
       management behavior and practices led Enron down the path from
       truly innovative to fraudulent management? How could Enron’s board
       of directors have failed to detect the business, ethical, and legal
       risks embedded in the company’s aggressive financial strategies and
       accounting practices? Why did Enron’s external watchdogs—security
       analysts, credit-rating agencies, and regulatory agencies—fail to
       bark? What actions can prevent Enron-type breakdowns in the future?
       Innovation Corrupted addresses each of these questions.

Tatiana Sandino

   Associate Professor of Business Administration
   Print Entire ProfileMore

   Tatiana Sandino is an Associate Professor of Business Administration in
   the Accounting and Management Unit, most recently teaching the
   second-year MBA course Mastering Strategy Execution and the doctoral
   course Management Control and Performance Measurement.

   Professor Sandino's research examines how organizations use management
   control systems—systems put in place by managers to ensure the actions
   and decisions of employees are consistent with the organization’s
   objectives. She is particularly interested in addressing challenges
   associated with introducing management control systems in growing,
   multiunit organizations (such as retailers, banks, hotels or restaurant
   chains). As these organizations grow, founders implement systems to
   maintain consistency and achieve economies of scale. While such systems
   can initially help scale up an organization, they can also limit its
   flexibility to adapt to new markets. Professor Sandino looks at design
   choices of management control systems to enable agility: how systems
   can be designed to empower employees, promote an engaging
   organizational environment, and nurture their intrinsic motivation to
   create value. Additionally, she studies how executive compensation is
   determined and what role different parties (boards, consultants, and
   shareholders) play in setting it.

   Professor Sandino’s work has been published in The Accounting Review,
   the Journal of Accounting and Economics, the Journal of Accounting
   Research, Management Science, and Contemporary Accounting Research. Her
   research has also been featured in The Wall Street Journal, Financial
   Times, The Huffington Post, CNBC and Strategic Finance among others.

   Prior to joining the HBS faculty, Professor Sandino was an Assistant
   Professor at the Marshall School of Business, University of Southern
   California, where she received the Dean’s Award for Research
   Excellence. She earned her doctorate from Harvard Business School, her
   MBA from INCAE Business School, Managua, Nicaragua, and her Licenciate
   degree in Industrial Engineering at the University of Costa Rica, San
   José, Costa Rica.

       Effects of an Information Sharing System on Employee Creativity,
       Engagement, and Performance
       Many service organizations rely on information sharing systems to
       boost employee creativity to meet customer needs. We conducted a
       field experiment in a retail chain, based on a registered report
       accepted by JAR, to test whether an information sharing system
       recording employees’ creative work affected the quality of creative
       work, job engagement, and financial performance. We found that, on
       average, this system did not have a significant effect on any
       outcomes. However, it significantly improved the quality of
       creative work in stores that had accessed the system more
       frequently and in stores with fewer same-company nearby stores. It
       also improved creative work and job engagement in stores in
       divergent markets, where customers needed more customization. We
       found weak evidence of better financial results where salespeople
       had lower creative talent before the system was introduced. Our
       findings shed light on those conditions in which information
       sharing systems affect employees’ creative work.

       Can Wages Buy Honesty? The Relationship between Relative Wages and
       Employee Theft
       In this study we examine whether, for a sample of retail chains,
       high levels of employee compensation can deter employee theft, an
       increasingly common type of fraudulent behavior. Specifically, we
       examine the extent to which relative wages (i.e., employee wages
       relative to the wages paid to comparable employees in competing
       stores) affect employee theft as measured by inventory shrinkage
       and cash shortage. Using two store-level datasets from the
       convenience store industry, we find that relative wages are
       negatively associated with employee theft after we control for each
       store’s employee characteristics, monitoring environment, and
       socio-economic environment. Moreover, we find that relatively
       higher wages also promote social norms such that coworkers are less
       (more) likely to collude to steal inventory from their company when
       relative wages are higher (lower). Our research contributes to an
       emerging literature in management control that explores the effect
       of efficiency wages on employee behavior and social norms.

       Executive Pay and "Independent" Compensation Consultants
       Executive compensation consultants face potential conflicts of
       interest that can lead to higher recommended levels of CEO pay,
       including the desires to “cross-sell” services and to secure
       “repeat business.” We find evidence in both the US and Canada that
       CEO pay is higher in companies where the consultant provides other
       services, and that pay is higher in Canadian firms when the fees
       paid to consultants for other services are large relative to the
       fees for executive-compensation services. Contrary to expectations,
       we find that pay is higher in US firms where the consultant works
       for the board rather than for management.

       Organizational Design and Control Across Multiple Markets: The Case
       of Franchising in the Convenience Store Industry
       Many companies operate units that are dispersed across different
       types of markets, serving significantly diverging customer bases.
       Such dispersion is likely to compromise headquarters' ability to
       control local managers' behavior and satisfy the needs of different
       customer types. In this study we find that market-type dispersion
       is an important determinant of the delegation of decision rights
       and the provision of incentives. Using a sample of convenience
       store chains, we show that market-type dispersion is positively
       associated with the degree of franchising at the chain level as
       well as the probability of franchising a given store within a
       chain. Our results are robust to alternative definitions of
       market-type dispersion and to other determinants of franchising
       such as the stores' geographic dispersion. Additional analyses
       suggest that chains that do not franchise cope with market-type
       dispersion by decentralizing operations from headquarters to their
       stores and providing their store managers higher variable pay.

Shelle M. Santana

   Assistant Professor of Business Administration
   Print Entire ProfileMore

   Shelle Santana is an assistant professor of business administration in
   the Marketing Unit at Harvard Business School, where she teaches the
   Marketing course to first-year MBA students. Before pursuing her
   academic career, she held a variety of senior marketing roles at
   American Express Company, ultimately as head of U.S. corporate card
   marketing and global product strategy.

   In one stream of research, Professor Santana explores how consumers
   respond to various pricing strategies in the marketplace. In one of her
   current projects, she examines how “drip pricing,” where sellers
   gradually reveal individual price components for a product or service,
   affects consumers’ current choices and future behavior intentions. In
   another, she shows how individual and contextual factors influence
   prices paid by consumers in pay-what-you-want settings. Professor
   Santana’s work has been published in the Journal of Retailing, and she
   co-authored “Consumer Financial Protection Legislation” in Regulating
   Wall Street: The Dodd-Frank Act and the New Architecture of Global
   Finance.

   A second stream of research looks at consumers’ subjective value of
   money—or how people tend to spend and save differently depending on the
   type and form of currency that they are using. Currently, she is
   examining how consumers value credit card loyalty points relative to
   cash as a form of currency.

   Professor Santana earned her Ph.D. and M.Phil. in marketing from the
   Stern School of Business at New York University. She holds an M.B.A.
   from Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business and a B.S. from Cornell
   University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations.

       Super Bowl Storytelling
       Shelle Santana and Jill Avery
       The one day a year when consumers not only tolerate but actually
       eagerly anticipate ads is during the NFL's Super Bowl. In sharp
       contrast to their behavior on the other 364 days of the year,
       consumers watch an average of 89 commercials per Super Bowl game
       for an average of 46 minutes. Why are consumers willing to spend
       3.5x more time watching commercials on the Super Bowl than on any
       other day of the year? Perhaps because they have come to expect the
       best, most creative, most engaging storytelling of the year from
       advertisers. With one out of every three Americans glued to the
       game, advertisers know they have a captive audience and they go to
       great lengths to stand out in what is somewhat akin to a battle of
       the brands. However, at a cost of more than $5 million for a
       30-second spot, is Super Bowl advertising worth it? And, which
       types of Super Bowl stories are more and less likely to "win" on
       the Super Bowl?

       Garanti Payment Systems: Digital Transformation Strategy (B)
       Shelle M. Santana and Esel Çekin
       Supplements the (A) case. Işıl Akdemir Evlioğlu, executive vice
       president of marketing at Garanti Payment Systems (GPS), a
       subsidiary of Garanti Bank, is grappling with three questions.
       First, should GPS create its own mobile app for credit card
       customers or leverage the bank’s already successful mobile banking
       app? Second, if a separate app was developed, then who should
       manage it? GPS managed the bank’s credit card business and was as a
       separate entity, but the bank’s digital assets were managed
       exclusively by the bank. Third, if a separate app was not
       developed, then would the required breadth and depth of
       functionality for the credit card customers be delivered? If a
       separate app was not developed, then would GPS be able to design
       one when they had never done so before? The credit card business
       included a popular loyalty program and GPS leadership was very
       focused on customer engagement and experience for program
       enrollees, but how best to do that was a critical question.

       Membership Rewards® from American Express
       Shelle Santana, Frances X. Frei and Lauren G. Pickle
       Credit and charge card issuer American Express (Amex) had developed
       a strong reputation among consumers due in part to its Membership
       Rewards (MR) loyalty program, first established in 1991. Through
       MR, all Amex cardholders could accumulate and redeem “points” based
       on how much they spent, while customers with Amex’s Gold and
       Platinum Cards received additional perks. By 2016, however, the
       U.S. credit card market had become increasingly competitive, with
       many credit card companies increasing their sign-on point bonuses
       for new customers. Chris Cracchiolo, Amex’s vice president of U.S.
       loyalty, strategy, and global partnerships, had to decide how to
       position the MR program in the face of this competition. Should
       Amex begin offering more competitive sign-on bonuses and point
       redemption rates, or would this dilute the company’s strong brand?

       Chase Sapphire: Creating a Millennial Cult Brand
       Shelle Santana, Jill Avery and Christine Snively
       The launch of the Chase Sapphire Reserve credit card was
       enthusiastically received by millennial consumers, a cohort that
       had previously eluded JPMorgan Chase and its competitors. With the
       one-year anniversary of the launch approaching, managers are
       focused on retaining customers attracted by a one-time signup bonus
       of 100,000 reward points and on acquiring new customers now that
       the bonus had been reduced to 50,000 points. They were also
       refocusing on the remainder of the Chase Sapphire product portfolio
       to assess differentiation among the products and to identify white
       space in the market that could support additional new product
       launches.

    9. Case | HBS Case Collection | August 2015 (Revised December 2016)
       Apple Pay
       Sunil Gupta, Shelle Santana and Margaret L. Rodriguez
       On September 9, 2014, in front of a packed audience in Cupertino,
       CA, Tim Cook, the chief executive officer of Apple, announced the
       much anticipated launch of Apple Pay. "Our vision is to replace
       this [wallet] and we are going to start with payments." Cook then
       invited Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet
       Software and Services, to the stage to explain how Apple Pay would
       transform the mobile payments industry. He explained how Apple Pay
       would allow consumers to complete the check-out process within apps
       with a single touch, and without needing to repeatedly enter credit
       card information, the billing address, or shipping address.
       On October 20, 2014, U.S. consumers could start using Apple Pay in
       stores with their iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus (and later Apple Watch)
       and within apps using iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPad Air 2 and iPad
       mini 3. By March 2015, Apple Pay was accepted in 700,000 retail
       locations including Coca-Cola vending machines. "We are the fastest
       adopted mobile payment service by a long shot," noted Jennifer
       Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay. However, Cue and Bailey were
       aware that the landscape of mobile wallets and payment services was
       littered with failures. Reflecting on these challenges, Bailey
       wondered, "What should Apple do to continue the early momentum for
       the adoption and use of Apple Pay?"

   Print Entire ProfileMore

   Earl Sasser is a Baker Foundation Professor at Harvard Business School
   and has been a member of the faculty there since 1969. He received a
   B.A. in Mathematics from Duke University in 1965, an MBA from the
   University of North Carolina in 1967, and a Ph.D. in Economics from
   Duke University in 1969.

   Sasser developed the School's first course on the management of service
   operations in 1972. Professor Sasser has taught a variety of courses in
   the MBA program including Production and Operations Management,
   Decision Making and Ethical Values, The Operating Manager, and Service
   Management. In 1982, Sasser's excellence in the classroom was
   recognized in an article in Fortune profiling eight professors from
   business schools throughout the country. Professor Sasser was Chairman
   of the MBA Program from 1988 to 1991. He was also faculty chair of the
   Advanced Management Program executive education program from 1992-1995.
   From 1995-2000 Professor Sasser served as Senior Associate Dean of
   Executive Education. He served as Chairman of the Board of Harvard
   Business School Interactive, a not-for-profit corporation, from 2000 to
   2003. Sasser is the past faculty chair of executive education's Program
   for Leadership Development [PLD] -- a program for which he served as
   the principal architect in 2004. He presently teaches in the
   Owner/President Management Program and serves as faculty chair of
   several week-long leadership programs.

   In 1990 he co-authored (with HBS Professor James L. Heskett and former
   HBS assistant professor Christopher W.L. Hart) Service Breakthroughs:
   Changing the Rules of the Game. Based upon five years of extensive
   research in fourteen service industries, it explains how one or two
   firms in each industry are constantly able to set new standards for
   quality and value that force competitors to adapt or fail. Sasser has
   co-authored several other books in the field of service management
   including Management of Service Operations and The Service Management
   Course, The Service Profit Chain and The Value Profit Chain (with
   Professor James L. Heskett and Leonard A. Schlesinger) The Free Press:
   2003. Professor Sasser's new book, Ownership Quotient: Putting the
   Service Profit Chain to Work for Unbeatable Competitive Advantage (with
   Professor James L. Hesket and Joe Wheeler), was published by the
   Harvard Business School Press, 2008.

   Sasser has written or co-written ten articles for Harvard Business
   Review, including "Putting the Service Profit Chain to Work," "The
   Profitable Art of Service Recovery," "Zero Defections: Quality Comes to
   Services," "Match Supply and Demand in Service Industries," and "Why
   Satisfied Customer Defect."

   Professor Sasser serves as a consultant to a number of companies in
   North America, Asia and Europe.

       What Great Service Leaders Know and Do: Creating Breakthroughs in
       Service Firms
       James L. Heskett, W. Earl Sasser and Leonard A. Schlesinger
       Based on decades of collective field experiences, the authors
       present anecdotal evidence in support of eight things that great
       service leaders know and do. Great service leaders know that (1)
       leading a breakthrough service is different, and they take steps to
       ensure repeated memorable service encounters; (2) customers buy
       results and excellent experiences, not services or products, so
       leaders focus on the few things that produce results and
       experiences for the right customers; (3) the best service operating
       strategies don't require tradeoffs, so leaders foster "both/and"
       thinking in designing winning operating strategies; (4) great
       service starts with the frontline employee, and as a result leaders
       hire for attitude and train for skills; (5) effective operating
       strategies have to create value for employees, customers and
       investors, so leaders ensure the achievement of the leverage and
       edge that produce win, win, win results—the "service trifecta"; (6)
       the best uses of technology and other support systems create
       frontline service heroes and heroines, so leaders use technology to
       elevate the most important and eliminate the worst service jobs;
       (7) satisfying customers is not enough, so leaders take steps to
       develop a core of customers who are "owners"; and (8) knowing that
       their current beliefs about the future of services are wrong, great
       service leaders build agile service organizations that learn,
       innovate, and adapt. The book explores the ideas and leadership
       needed to achieve breakthrough service.

       Ownership Quotient: Putting the Service Profit Chain to Work for
       Unbeatable Competitive Advantage
       James L. Heskett, W. Earl Sasser Jr. and Joe Wheeler
       Hundreds of large organizations worldwide have used the
       groundbreaking Service Profit Chain to improve business
       performance. Now The Ownership Quotient reveals the next generation
       of the chain: customer and employee "owners" of your business.
       Employee-owners exhibit such enthusiasm for their organization that
       they infect countless customers with similar satisfaction, loyalty,
       and dedication. Customer-owners are in turn so satisfied with their
       experience that they relate their stories to others, persuade them
       to try your product, and provide constructive criticism and new
       product ideas. As a new generation of managers has been changing
       the way that products and services are designed and delivered,
       authors Heskett, Sasser, and Wheeler have followed the evolution of
       this new ownership model. Case studies from companies as diverse as
       Harrah's Entertainment, ING Direct, Build-a-Bear Workshop, and
       Wegmans Food Markets bring home the central principle of
       engagement—and showcase ways to raise the ownership quotient among
       both your employees and your customers. With the authors' decades
       of consulting and research paving the way, you'll learn to identify
       your customer-owners; consistently exceed their expectations in
       ways they truly appreciate; and foster, measure, and grow the
       Ownership Quotient throughout your company. An organization that
       learns how to cultivate an ownership attitude creates a
       self-reinforcing relationship between customers and front-line
       employees. The lifetime value of a customer-owner can be equivalent
       to that of more than a hundred typical customers. And that makes
       the lifetime value of an employee who can promote customer
       ownership priceless. This powerful and practical book shows you how
       to add that value to your company and delight your employees,
       customers, and investors. Is your organization ready to make the
       transition to an ownership state of mind?

       Challenge the Boss or Stand Down
       W. Earl Sasser
       This HBR Case Study includes both the case and the commentary. For
       teaching purposes, this reprint is also available in two other
       versions: case study-only, reprint R1105X, and commentary-only,
       R1105Z. Tom Green, an aggressive young sales executive at
       self-service kiosk company D7 Displays, has been promoted to senior
       marketing specialist by Shannon McDonald, his division VP. Shannon
       had warned Tom that she was taking a chance with him and that he'd
       have to learn fast and work well with his new boss, Frank Davis,
       who wouldn't have chosen Tom for the position. On the job, Tom
       finds himself at odds with Frank and challenges him openly at a
       well-attended meeting. Frank begins to formally document
       deficiencies in Tom's performance, and McDonald falls in line with
       Frank. With his back against the wall, Tom must carefully consider
       his next move. Harvard Business School professor W. Earl Sasser
       presents the fictional case. Jeffrey Pfeffer, of Stanford
       University, and Paul Falcone, of Time Warner Cable, offer their
       expert commentary.

       Jaime Giancola, an MBA student, has recently completed an
       operations management course in which aggregate production planning
       (APP) was one of the topics. She believes that her family's
       business, Cataumet Boats, which her grandparents started and which
       her mother and uncle now own, might benefit from applying APP
       concepts to identify the different ways they might schedule
       workers, which could be especially valuable during the peak demand
       seasons of fall and spring. The goal of using APP is to reduce
       labor costs without sacrificing the high level of customer service
       that Cataumet Boats is known for providing.

       Allianz Turkey: Focus on the Customer (B)
       W. Earl Sasser and Gamze Yucaoglu
       At the age of 39, Solmaz Altın took over the helm at Allianz
       Turkey. Solmaz quickly realized that, although the insurance market
       was thinly penetrated in Turkey, the company was operating in a
       very competitive environment with pressure on prices and, hence,
       cost control. Consequently, customer satisfaction was suffering.
       Despite the growing Turkish economy and a favorable regulatory
       environment, Solmaz was struggling to grow the company without
       further sacrificing customer satisfaction or profitability.
       Used as part of a course on service excellence, the case provides
       an insurance context in which to explore the link between customer
       satisfaction and competitive performance and challenges the
       students to ponder the extent of the relationship between customer
       satisfaction and financial performance.
       In the (A) case, the Allianz Turkey executives focus their initial
       efforts on the claims process of the automobile insurance
       business—a lowly rated segment of the insurance industry by their
       policyholders. They begin by creating a map of the customer
       experience and then doing extensive consumer research to determine

       Allianz Turkey: Focus on the Customer (A)
       W. Earl Sasser and Gamze Yucaoglu
       At the age of 39, Solmaz Altın took over the helm at Allianz
       Turkey. Solmaz quickly realized that, although the insurance market
       was thinly penetrated in Turkey, the company was operating in a
       very competitive environment with pressure on prices and, hence,
       cost control. Consequently, customer satisfaction was suffering.
       Despite the growing Turkish economy and a favorable regulatory
       environment, Solmaz was struggling to grow the company without
       further sacrificing customer satisfaction or profitability.
       Used as part of a course on service excellence, the case provides
       an insurance context in which to explore the link between customer
       satisfaction and competitive performance and challenges the
       students to ponder the extent of the relationship between customer
       satisfaction and financial performance.
       In the (A) case, the Allianz Turkey executives focus their initial
       efforts on the claims process of the automobile insurance
       business—a lowly rated segment of the insurance industry by their
       policyholders. They begin by creating a map of the customer
       experience and then doing extensive consumer research to determine
       what really matters to the policyholder. The insights gleaned from
       the detailed consumer analysis are quite different than the
       original beliefs of the management team. Students must devise a new
       customer service model for the claims process based upon the
       customer analysis.
       The (B) case describes the new customer service model for the
       claims process and the resulting increase in customer satisfaction
       as measured by the Net Promoter Score (NPS) metric. Students must
       first decide whether the initial effort is a success and then
       develop a plan for the future.

       WrapItUp: Developing a New Compensation Plan
       W. Earl Sasser Jr. and Rachel Shelton
       A restaurant chain based in California offers made-to-order
       sandwich wraps using fresh, healthy ingredients. The founders of
       the company take a very active role in day-to-day business and
       tightly control every aspect of the restaurant operation from
       hiring store managers to planning the menu. Management is concerned
       that employee turnover is high, customer satisfaction is
       decreasing, and revenue growth is flat. The newly hired human
       resources leader believes addressing employee turnover can help
       solve the other problems. She develops a profit-sharing program as
       a pilot at two restaurants. The managers in the pilot program have
       their compensation tied directly to restaurant profits. The program
       also allows managers to customize menus, work with local suppliers,
       and try different promotion ideas. After six months, profits at the
       pilot locations improve while customer reviews are mixed. The HR
       manager must review the complete results and decide whether to roll
       out the pilot program to more locations, modify the program, or
       abandon it altogether. Students consider the operational challenges
       of running a service business and the issues related to
       compensation, change management, and employee autonomy.

       Playa Dorada Tennis Club: Expansion Strategy
       W. Earl Sasser Jr. and Brent Kazan
       Playa Dorada Beach & Resort in Boca Raton, Florida, faces a growing
       seasonal demand for tennis services. The number of guests is
       expected to double in the next few years, and while the tennis
       facilities are a popular and well-promoted amenity at the resort,
       court space is limited. The director of tennis operations analyzes
       court capacity, usage history, pricing, and other factors as he
       assembles a plan for expansion. He must also consider how his
       strategy affects other divisions of the Playa Dorada Corporation,
       including finance, operations, marketing, and sales. Can he
       transform the resort's tennis operations into a profit center? To
       prepare for case discussion, students complete a quantitative

       Southwest Airlines: In a Different World
       James L. Heskett and W. Earl Sasser Jr.
       This is the fourth in a 35-year series of HBS cases on an
       organization that has changed the rules of the game globally for an
       entire industry by offering both differentiated and low-price
       service. The focus of the case is on whether Southwest Airlines
       should buy gates and slots to initiate service to New York's
       LaGuardia airport, which does not fit the airline's profile for
       cost, ease of service, and other factors. The bigger issue is how
       the organization should deal with competition that has successfully
       emulated more and more of what it does in an operating environment
       that has changed significantly. Hence the subtitle, which was
       suggested by Herb Kelleher, Southwest's Chairman and CEO, Emeritus.

       Green, who, after being rapidly promoted, is harshly criticized by
       his boss, Frank Davis. Green and Davis disagree on work styles and
       market projections. Green believes the sales goals set by Davis are

       market environment. A mood of silent conflict develops quickly
       between the two men, and Green is concerned that Davis is building
       a case to fire him. Green's situation is one in which his failure
       to adapt his work style and fully understand the demands and
       boundaries of his new position may lead to his discharge. A factor
       in the background is Green's relationship with his boss's boss.

       Information at the World Bank: In Search of a Technology Solution
       (A)
       W. Earl Sasser, Josep Valor and Carin-Isabel Knoop
       Information Technology Services Director Mohamed Muhsin planned to
       restructure the World Bank's information technology in response to
       President Jim Wolfensohn's call to build a knowledge bank. Several
       reorganization efforts taken by the bank in the 1980s led to a
       decentralized system, which hindered the access to and sharing of
       information within the bank. By the early 1990s, the organization's
       values had shifted, calling for more collaboration among all bank
       sectors. The creation and implementation of a standardized,
       user-friendly information technology system was needed. Describes
       how Muhsin planned to restructure and the challenges he would face.

       Au Bon Pain: The French Bakery Cafe, The Partner/Manager Program
       W. Earl Sasser
       In recent years, Au Bon Pain (ABP), a chain of upscale French
       bakeries/sandwich cafes based in Boston, confronted a set of human
       resource problems endemic to the fast food industry (i.e., a labor
       shortage which made it difficult to attract and maintain quality
       crew personnel and management candidates, an inadequately trained
       management staff, and high turnover). To deal with the resulting
       "cycle of failure" while increasing individual initiative and
       performance at the unit level, ABP devised a new
       compensation-incentive system for its store managers--the
       Partner/Manager Program. Under this program, store managers would
       be paid a standard base salary plus a share of the incremental
       profits. The case asks students to evaluate the program by
       comparing it to ABP's existing compensation system, determining the
       different ways in which managers from two stores operating under an
       experimental run of the program achieved their results, and by
       considering the strategic implications of implementing the program
       in all of the company's stores.
