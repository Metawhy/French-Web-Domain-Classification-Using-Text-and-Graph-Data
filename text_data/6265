£39 billion divorce bill not 'strictly speaking owed' in event of no-deal
Brexit, Boris Johnson claims

     * Video report by ITV News Political Editor Robert Peston

   The Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told ITV News there will be
   "substantial sums" for the UK to spend on "our priorities" in the event
   of a no-deal Brexit.

   Speaking at the G7 summit - an informal club of rich nations that meets
   annually to discuss major issues - Mr Johnson said the £39 billion
   divorce bill would "strictly speaking" no longer be due to the EU.

   He refused to be drawn on the exact figures available should the
   country crash out without a deal, but insisted it would be to the UK's
   benefit.

   "If we come out without an agreement it is certainly true that the £39
   billion is no longer strictly speaking owed," he said.

   "I'm not going to get into the figures, but there will very substantial
   sums available to our country to spend on our priorities, to spend on
   getting on getting our businesses ready.

   "It's not a threat, it's a simple statement of reality, that's the way
   things are."

   Mr Johnson has been using the summit in Biarritz to hold talks with
   European Council President Donald Tusk, who earlier warned him not to
   go down in history as "Mr No Deal".
     * ITV News Political Editor Robert Peston reports from Biarritz where
       he says that a no-deal Brexit is looking more likely than ever,
       with only British MPs standing in the way of this. He predicts the
       "mother of all Parliamentary crises" when politicians return from
       their summer recess in September.

   Mr Johnson also claimed the EU had accepted the UK's stance on removing
   the Irish backstop from the Withdrawal Agreement and were willing to
   reopen negotiations.

   Since Mr Johnson's appointment as Conservative Party leader in July,
   there has been a stand-off between No 10 and the EU, with both sides
   seemingly unwilling to try and reach a new compromise, making the
   prospect of a no-deal Brexit increasingly likely.

   But on Sunday, Mr Johnson told ITV News' Political Editor Robert Peston
   in Biarritz that there was a more conciliatory spirit from the bloc.

   "I hope you'll agree that in the last few days there has been change in
   mood I think, in the EU," he said.

     * PM plays down expectations of speedy US trade deal ahead of Trump

     * Trade deal with Trump will not be 'plain sailing', says Johnson
       ahead of summit

   "They recognise that we're willing to talk about progress that can be
   made. Of course, they say it's impossible, they say that they can't get
   rid of the backstop.

   "The point that we're making to them is that unless they get rid of
   that system that keeps the UK locked in to the regulatory orbit, the
   trading system of the EU with no say in those things for the UK. Unless
   they get rid of that there's no way, we can do a deal. And I think that
   point has landed."

   After speaking to Robert Peston, Mr Johnson met with Mr Tusk and said
   the pair discussed Brexit and foreign policy issues.

   Downing Street added that the Prime Minister had told the European
   Council President: "We will work in an energetic and determined way to
   get a better deal and we are very willing to sit down to talk with the
   EU and member states about what needs to be done to achieve that".

   But an EU official said the meeting had mainly restated known positions
   and Brussels had been hoping for "new elements to unblock the
   situation".

   Speaking to Robert Peston ahead of the meeting, Mr Johnson had said it
   "would be sensible" for negotiations with the EU to "get going now" and
   used his morning swim in the Atlantic as an example of how things could
   be done.

   "Let me give you a metaphor. I swam round that rock this morning. Now,
   from here you cannot tell that there is a gigantic hole in that rock,
   there is a way through. My point to the EU, there's a way through but
   you can't find the way through if you just sit on the beach. That would
   be my message. So, let's get going'."

   After his morning dip, Mr Johnson had also met with US President Donald
   Trump for a breakfast meeting where a post-Brexit trade deal was among
   the topics discussed.

   Mr Johnson reiterated his point that a trade deal with the US would not
   be "plain sailing" but said there was an "opportunity to do a great
   free trade deal with the United States" something he said President
   Trump was "very gung-ho about".

   He also stressed "NHS in no way can be part of the negotiations".

   "There are real issues for UK business and manufactures of all kinds
   because of the barriers they face in the US. I don't think people
   realise quite how protectionist sometimes the US market can be.

   "So, what I'm saying to Donald, to President Trump, this is a big
   opportunity for both of us,but we need to see some movement and we need
   to see movement from the US side as well."

   summit.

   As the October 31 deadline looms ever nearer with no new negotiations
   officially scheduled, preparations for a no-deal Brexit have been
   ramped up, but Mr Johnson insisted the country would be ready if the UK
   left the EU without a deal.

   "Of course, on no-deal you're right that we have to prepare for it, and
   we have to work very hard, as we are, to minimise any possible economic
   consequences and as I said on the steps of Downing Street there will be
   bumps on the road.

   "With every day that goes by, with all the preparation that we're
   making, we think that we're minimising those risks."

   As well as the G7 members of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the
   UK, the US, and the leaders of the EU, France, as the host, invited
   India, Chile, South Africa and Australia as important regional
   democracies, plus four African nations: Burkina Faso, Egypt, Senegal,
   and Rwanda.

   On Sunday, a senior French official said the country's President
   Emmanuel Macron had also invited Iran's foreign minister in a bid to
   ease tensions over its nuclear program.

   The official said the decision to invite Jawad Zarif came after the G7
   leaders gathered for dinner Saturday night.

   Asked whether the White House was aware of the visit, the French
   official said "we operate on our own terms" but noted that Mr Macron
   and Mr Trump met for two hours on Saturday and discussed Iran at
   length, as well as at the group dinner.

   They continued that the Americans in Biarritz will not meet with Mr
   Zarif, and that France "is working in full transparency with the US and
   in full transparency with European partners".

   Away from the topic of the G7, Mr Johnson would not be drawn by Peston
   on whether he had confidence in Prince Andrew following media reports
   about his friendship with the US financier Jeffrey Epstein who killed
   himself in prison two weeks ago, but commended the Duke of York's
   "hard" work "selling the UK overseas".

   "Let me tell you something, I've worked with Prince Andrew, I've seen
   the good he's been able to do for UK business overseas. And other than
   that I have absolutely no knowledge of these matters and no comment to
   make," Mr Johnson said.

   The Prime Minister's comments came as he faced a backlash over reports
   he had sought legal advice from Attorney General Geoffrey Cox about
   temporarily shutting down Parliament - known as prorogation - for five
   weeks from September 9.

   The Observer reported that the move would allow for a Queen's Speech,
   starting a new parliamentary session, on October 14.

   Such a move would keep MPs away from the Commons until shortly before
   the European Council summit of EU leaders on October 17, potentially
   preventing moves to block a no-deal Brexit.

   A Government source said the claim was "entirely false".

Prince Harry to launch sustainable tourism project after criticism over use
of private jet

   [main_stream_Chris_Ship_cut_out.jpg]

   Prince Harry will launch a major project today to promote a more
   sustainable approach to tourism across the world.

   His new charity foundation has teamed up with some of the biggest
   international travel companies to encourage passengers and tourists to
   think about the impact they are having on ecosystems, communities,
   wildlife and pollution.

   He travelled to Amsterdam yesterday - on a commercial flight - to
   announce the campaign which has been two years in the making.

   He will not call on people to travel less but instead to think about
   the impact of their actions.

   Harry will talk about the benefits that travel can bring – like a
   better understanding of other people and different cultures - but he
   wants to ensure local communities are not overlooked and local habitats
   are not destroyed in the process.

   The Duke of Sussex is concerned that the work he’s has put into this
   project risks being undone after the recent criticisms of the way he
   and his wife Meghan travelled by private jet to their summer vacations
   in Ibiza and the South of France.

   The Duke is likely to address that particular matter in his speech
   today.

   A royal source said that “it’s not been lost on him” that the private
   jet issue might overshadow this campaign – the first for Harry and
   Meghan’s new Sussex Foundation.

   The Sussexes have been stung by the criticisms of their choice of
   aircraft for their summer holiday – and several of their friends and
   celebrities leapt to their defence immediately when their travel plans
   were revealed.

   Sorry, this content isn't available on your device.

   After Harry and Meghan’s recent high profile campaigns on the
   environment and climate change, they left themselves open to the charge
   of hypocrisy.

   Unsurprisingly, Prince Harry did not travel to the Netherlands on a
   private aircraft.

   Harry’s new project is being supported by some international travel
   giants like Booking.com, TripAdvisor, SkyScanner and Visa.

   And the key sponsors of the event, have offered to offset the carbon
   created by each and every participant – including members of the media
   such as ourselves (in the interests of transparency, we are travelling
   to and from Amsterdam on a commercial flight).

   The campaign will attempt to address the pressures created by tourism
   from the choice of travel and accommodation to the impact on coastlines
   and habitats.

   The Sussexes will highlight this eco-tourism issue in Africa when the
   couple travel there for their big Royal Tour later this month.

   Harry and Meghan and their 4 month old son Archie will tour Cape Town
   and Johannesburg in South Africa and Harry will also travel alone to
   Botswana, Angola and Malawi.

   The Sussex Foundation will be officially launched next year to
   spearhead the charity and philanthropic work of the Duke and Duchess of
   Sussex – after they split from the Royal Foundation they had set up
   with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

   It will have an international focus, and this first project is an
   example of the kind of work they hope to do with the foundation.

   Courtiers never usually comment on the travel plans of members of the
   Royal Family, but they did reveal how Harry travelled here to ensure
   the campaign launch was not overshadowed.

Love Island's Maura 'getting flutters' ahead of This Morning presenting gig

   10:09 - 3 Aug 2019
   Maura

   Following her holiday of a lifetime on this year’s Love Island,
   finalist Maura Higgins is the first of this year’s Islanders to land a
   presenting role and will be joining the This Morning family for her
   first-ever hosting gig.

   Maura's initial appearance is confirmed for Monday 5 August for a chat
   with Eamonn and Ruth, followed by Maura hosting her very own phone-in
   to dish out her much-loved no-nonsense advice.

   In addition, Maura will host a brand new strand called Maura Than Meets
   the Eye, a series of short films which will see the star take on
   various challenges up and down the country.
   Maura Higgins

   Maura, who came fourth on the dating show with partner Curtis Pritchard
   says, “I'm getting the flutters about joining This Morning. I can't
   believe it. It's beyond my wildest dreams! I've grown up watching
   Phillip, Holly, Eamonn, Ruth and the whole team. Mad to think I'm now
   part of that iconic family! Can't wait to crack on."

   Editor Martin Frizell says: “This Morning has a history of developing
   the careers of reality stars with Rylan, Vicky Pattison, Ferne McCann
   and Toff all getting their first TV presenting jobs on the show
   following their reality stints. Maura was the stand out star of this
   year’s villa antics with her straight-talking opinionated views and
   we’re delighted she now joins a long list of successful reality stars
   presenting on This Morning.”

£39 billion divorce bill not 'strictly speaking owed' in event of no-deal
Brexit, Boris Johnson claims

     * Video report by ITV News Political Editor Robert Peston

   The Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told ITV News there will be
   "substantial sums" for the UK to spend on "our priorities" in the event
   of a no-deal Brexit.

   Speaking at the G7 summit - an informal club of rich nations that meets
   annually to discuss major issues - Mr Johnson said the £39 billion
   divorce bill would "strictly speaking" no longer be due to the EU.

   He refused to be drawn on the exact figures available should the
   country crash out without a deal, but insisted it would be to the UK's
   benefit.

   "If we come out without an agreement it is certainly true that the £39
   billion is no longer strictly speaking owed," he said.

   "I'm not going to get into the figures, but there will very substantial
   sums available to our country to spend on our priorities, to spend on
   getting on getting our businesses ready.

   "It's not a threat, it's a simple statement of reality, that's the way
   things are."

   Mr Johnson has been using the summit in Biarritz to hold talks with
   European Council President Donald Tusk, who earlier warned him not to
   go down in history as "Mr No Deal".
     * ITV News Political Editor Robert Peston reports from Biarritz where
       he says that a no-deal Brexit is looking more likely than ever,
       with only British MPs standing in the way of this. He predicts the
       "mother of all Parliamentary crises" when politicians return from
       their summer recess in September.

   Mr Johnson also claimed the EU had accepted the UK's stance on removing
   the Irish backstop from the Withdrawal Agreement and were willing to
   reopen negotiations.

   Since Mr Johnson's appointment as Conservative Party leader in July,
   there has been a stand-off between No 10 and the EU, with both sides
   seemingly unwilling to try and reach a new compromise, making the
   prospect of a no-deal Brexit increasingly likely.

   But on Sunday, Mr Johnson told ITV News' Political Editor Robert Peston
   in Biarritz that there was a more conciliatory spirit from the bloc.

   "I hope you'll agree that in the last few days there has been change in
   mood I think, in the EU," he said.

     * Trade deal with Trump will not be 'plain sailing', says Johnson
       ahead of summit

   "They recognise that we're willing to talk about progress that can be
   made. Of course, they say it's impossible, they say that they can't get
   rid of the backstop.

   "The point that we're making to them is that unless they get rid of
   that system that keeps the UK locked in to the regulatory orbit, the
   trading system of the EU with no say in those things for the UK. Unless
   they get rid of that there's no way, we can do a deal. And I think that
   point has landed."

   After speaking to Robert Peston, Mr Johnson met with Mr Tusk and said
   the pair discussed Brexit and foreign policy issues.

   Downing Street added that the Prime Minister had told the European
   Council President: "We will work in an energetic and determined way to
   get a better deal and we are very willing to sit down to talk with the
   EU and member states about what needs to be done to achieve that".

   But an EU official said the meeting had mainly restated known positions
   and Brussels had been hoping for "new elements to unblock the
   situation".

   restated known positions. Credit: PA

   Speaking to Robert Peston ahead of the meeting, Mr Johnson had said it
   "would be sensible" for negotiations with the EU to "get going now" and
   used his morning swim in the Atlantic as an example of how things could
   be done.

   "Let me give you a metaphor. I swam round that rock this morning. Now,
   from here you cannot tell that there is a gigantic hole in that rock,
   there is a way through. My point to the EU, there's a way through but
   you can't find the way through if you just sit on the beach. That would
   be my message. So, let's get going'."

   After his morning dip, Mr Johnson had also met with US President Donald
   Trump for a breakfast meeting where a post-Brexit trade deal was among
   the topics discussed.

   Mr Johnson reiterated his point that a trade deal with the US would not
   be "plain sailing" but said there was an "opportunity to do a great
   free trade deal with the United States" something he said President
   Trump was "very gung-ho about".

   He also stressed "NHS in no way can be part of the negotiations".

   "There are real issues for UK business and manufactures of all kinds
   because of the barriers they face in the US. I don't think people
   realise quite how protectionist sometimes the US market can be.

   "So, what I'm saying to Donald, to President Trump, this is a big
   opportunity for both of us,but we need to see some movement and we need
   to see movement from the US side as well."

   summit.

   As the October 31 deadline looms ever nearer with no new negotiations
   officially scheduled, preparations for a no-deal Brexit have been
   ramped up, but Mr Johnson insisted the country would be ready if the UK
   left the EU without a deal.

   "Of course, on no-deal you're right that we have to prepare for it, and
   we have to work very hard, as we are, to minimise any possible economic
   consequences and as I said on the steps of Downing Street there will be
   bumps on the road.

   "With every day that goes by, with all the preparation that we're
   making, we think that we're minimising those risks."

   As well as the G7 members of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the
   UK, the US, and the leaders of the EU, France, as the host, invited
   India, Chile, South Africa and Australia as important regional
   democracies, plus four African nations: Burkina Faso, Egypt, Senegal,
   and Rwanda.

   On Sunday, a senior French official said the country's President
   Emmanuel Macron had also invited Iran's foreign minister in a bid to
   ease tensions over its nuclear program.

   The official said the decision to invite Jawad Zarif came after the G7
   leaders gathered for dinner Saturday night.

   Asked whether the White House was aware of the visit, the French
   official said "we operate on our own terms" but noted that Mr Macron
   and Mr Trump met for two hours on Saturday and discussed Iran at
   length, as well as at the group dinner.

   They continued that the Americans in Biarritz will not meet with Mr
   Zarif, and that France "is working in full transparency with the US and
   in full transparency with European partners".

   Away from the topic of the G7, Mr Johnson would not be drawn by Peston
   on whether he had confidence in Prince Andrew following media reports
   about his friendship with the US financier Jeffrey Epstein who killed
   himself in prison two weeks ago, but commended the Duke of York's
   "hard" work "selling the UK overseas".

   "Let me tell you something, I've worked with Prince Andrew, I've seen
   the good he's been able to do for UK business overseas. And other than
   that I have absolutely no knowledge of these matters and no comment to
   make," Mr Johnson said.

   The Prime Minister's comments came as he faced a backlash over reports
   he had sought legal advice from Attorney General Geoffrey Cox about
   temporarily shutting down Parliament - known as prorogation - for five
   weeks from September 9.

   The Observer reported that the move would allow for a Queen's Speech,
   starting a new parliamentary session, on October 14.

   Such a move would keep MPs away from the Commons until shortly before
   the European Council summit of EU leaders on October 17, potentially
   preventing moves to block a no-deal Brexit.

   A Government source said the claim was "entirely false".

Prince Harry to launch sustainable tourism project after criticism over use
of private jet

   [thumb_Chris_Ship_cut_out.jpg]
   [main_stream_Chris_Ship_cut_out.jpg]
   Chris Ship Royal Editor

   Prince Harry will launch a major project today to promote a more
   sustainable approach to tourism across the world.

   His new charity foundation has teamed up with some of the biggest
   international travel companies to encourage passengers and tourists to
   think about the impact they are having on ecosystems, communities,
   wildlife and pollution.

   He travelled to Amsterdam yesterday - on a commercial flight - to
   announce the campaign which has been two years in the making.

   He will not call on people to travel less but instead to think about
   the impact of their actions.

   Harry will talk about the benefits that travel can bring – like a
   better understanding of other people and different cultures - but he
   wants to ensure local communities are not overlooked and local habitats
   are not destroyed in the process.

   The Duke of Sussex is concerned that the work he’s has put into this
   project risks being undone after the recent criticisms of the way he
   and his wife Meghan travelled by private jet to their summer vacations
   in Ibiza and the South of France.

   The Duke is likely to address that particular matter in his speech
   today.

   Sorry, this content isn't available on your device.

   A royal source said that “it’s not been lost on him” that the private
   jet issue might overshadow this campaign – the first for Harry and
   Meghan’s new Sussex Foundation.

   The Sussexes have been stung by the criticisms of their choice of
   aircraft for their summer holiday – and several of their friends and
   celebrities leapt to their defence immediately when their travel plans
   were revealed.

   Sorry, this content isn't available on your device.

   After Harry and Meghan’s recent high profile campaigns on the
   environment and climate change, they left themselves open to the charge
   of hypocrisy.

   Unsurprisingly, Prince Harry did not travel to the Netherlands on a
   private aircraft.

   Harry’s new project is being supported by some international travel
   giants like Booking.com, TripAdvisor, SkyScanner and Visa.

   And the key sponsors of the event, have offered to offset the carbon
   created by each and every participant – including members of the media
   such as ourselves (in the interests of transparency, we are travelling
   to and from Amsterdam on a commercial flight).

   The campaign will attempt to address the pressures created by tourism
   from the choice of travel and accommodation to the impact on coastlines
   and habitats.

   The Sussexes will highlight this eco-tourism issue in Africa when the
   couple travel there for their big Royal Tour later this month.

   Harry and Meghan and their 4 month old son Archie will tour Cape Town
   and Johannesburg in South Africa and Harry will also travel alone to
   Botswana, Angola and Malawi.

   The Sussex Foundation will be officially launched next year to
   spearhead the charity and philanthropic work of the Duke and Duchess of
   Sussex – after they split from the Royal Foundation they had set up
   with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

   It will have an international focus, and this first project is an
   example of the kind of work they hope to do with the foundation.

   Courtiers never usually comment on the travel plans of members of the
   Royal Family, but they did reveal how Harry travelled here to ensure
   the campaign launch was not overshadowed.

Love Island's Maura 'getting flutters' ahead of This Morning presenting gig

   10:09 - 3 Aug 2019
   Maura

   Following her holiday of a lifetime on this year’s Love Island,
   finalist Maura Higgins is the first of this year’s Islanders to land a
   presenting role and will be joining the This Morning family for her
   first-ever hosting gig.

   Maura's initial appearance is confirmed for Monday 5 August for a chat
   with Eamonn and Ruth, followed by Maura hosting her very own phone-in
   to dish out her much-loved no-nonsense advice.

   In addition, Maura will host a brand new strand called Maura Than Meets
   the Eye, a series of short films which will see the star take on
   various challenges up and down the country.
   Maura Higgins

   Maura, who came fourth on the dating show with partner Curtis Pritchard
   says, “I'm getting the flutters about joining This Morning. I can't
   believe it. It's beyond my wildest dreams! I've grown up watching
   Phillip, Holly, Eamonn, Ruth and the whole team. Mad to think I'm now
   part of that iconic family! Can't wait to crack on."

   Editor Martin Frizell says: “This Morning has a history of developing
   the careers of reality stars with Rylan, Vicky Pattison, Ferne McCann
   and Toff all getting their first TV presenting jobs on the show
   following their reality stints. Maura was the stand out star of this
   year’s villa antics with her straight-talking opinionated views and
   we’re delighted she now joins a long list of successful reality stars
   presenting on This Morning.”
