                 It was a pleasure speaking during the #WSBW panel
                 discussion today! Launch system flexibility – which is a

                 changing market landscape. @WSBW_Summit

MEASAT-3b lands in French Guiana, while its Ariane 5 launcher is delivered to
Arianespace at the Spaceport
                 In the photo at left, the shipping container with
                 MEASAT-3b emerges from the An-124 cargo aircraft after
                 delivery at Félix Eboué International Airport yesterday.
                 At right, Ariane 5 is transfered from the Spaceport’s
                 Launcher Integration Building to the Final Assembly
                 Building today.
                 Payload preparations for Arianespace’s next Ariane 5
                 mission are gearing up following this week’s delivery of
                 MEASAT-3b – one of two satellite passengers for launch on
                 the heavy-lift flight – to French Guiana.
                 This spacecraft was transported by a chartered An-124
                 cargo jetliner that landed at Félix Eboué International
                 Airport near the capital city of Cayenne, and was
                 unloaded for its transfer by road to the Spaceport.
                 In parallel activity, this mission’s Ariane 5 was moved
                 today from the Launcher Integration Building to the Final
                 Assembly Building – marking its delivery to Arianespace
                 by vehicle prime contractor Airbus Defense and Space.
                 With this step completed, the workhorse launcher is ready
                 for integration of its dual-satellite payload.
                 MEASAT-3b – which was produced by Airbus Defence and
                 Space based on the Eurostar E3000 platform – will be
                 operated by MEASAT to support direct-to-home broadcast
                 services for Malaysia, India, Indonesia and Australia.
                 Positioned at 91.5 degrees East, MEASAT-3b will be
                 co-located with the MEASAT-3 and MEASAT-3a satellites to
                 form a robust Asian direct-to-home neighborhood.
                 Joining MEASAT-3b as its Ariane 5 flight co-passenger is
                 Optus 10, which was produced by SSL (Space Systems/Loral)
                 for Australian telecommunications service provider Optus.
                 It is outfitted with 24 Ku-band transponders to provide
                 direct TV broadcast, internet connectivity, telephone and
                 data transmission services for Australia and New Zealand.
                 Designated Flight VA218 in Arianespace’s numbering
                 system, this upcoming mission represents the 218th launch
                 of an Ariane family vehicle.
