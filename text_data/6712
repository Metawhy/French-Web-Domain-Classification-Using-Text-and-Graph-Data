COOKIES AND THEIR USE

What’s a cookie?

     * A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your device (e.g. a
       computer, tablet, smartphone, connected TV, games consoles with an
       online connection) when you visit a website or view an ad.
     * It contains several items of data: the name of the server that sent
       it, a unique ID number and sometimes an expiry date. Cookies have
       different purposes. They save your language settings on a website,
       collect information on your browsing history and send you
       customised services.
     * Only the sender of a cookie can read, save or edit the information
       inside it.

WHERE DO COOKIES COME FROM?

Our cookies

   Our website uses different types of cookie. Their roles are described
   below, subject to your choice (refer to the chapter: Accepting or
   declining cookies).

Cookies essential to website operation

   These cookies are essential for browsing our website.

   They let you:
     * use the main website functions and ensure the security of your
       connection (for example, access to your account);
     * access the reserved, personal areas of our website, such as your
       account, using identifiers or data that you may have provided
       previously;
     * implement security measures, for example, when you are asked to
       reconnect to specific content or services after a certain period of
       time.

   Without these cookies, you will not be able to use our website
   normally. We advise you not to delete them.

Functional / functionality cookies

   These cookies are not essential for browsing our website but let you
   optimise operation by giving you access to specific functions. They
   enable us to:
     * personalise your browsing experience (e.g. by showing you the pages
       most recently viewed);
     * store data relating to forms completed on our website (registration
       or access to your account) or to any offers, services or
       information selected on our website (service subscription, content
       of a cart, etc.);
     * adapt website presentation to the display preferences of your
       device (language used, display resolution, operating system, etc.)
       when you visit our website.

Third-party cookies

   Cookies may be placed by third-party companies (for example,
   advertisers or partners) on our website. Their roles are described
   below, subject to your choice (refer to the chapter: Accepting or
   declining cookies).

Analytical / audience measurement cookies

   These cookies provide us with information on the performance and use of
   our website. They let us compile statistics, traffic and data on the
   use of the various components of our website (pages and content
   visited, click streams). This enables us to improve the relevance and
   ergonomics of our services (for example, the pages most frequently
   viewed or looked for via our search engine, etc.).

   We use Google Analytics tags for these various surveys.

Advertising cookies

   Third-party companies may place cookies to identify your areas of
   interest based on the content viewed on our website or in the emails
   that we send to you in order to personalise the advertising directed to
   you on or off our website. These cookies may be set when you browse our
   website, when you open one of our emails or when you click on adverts
   on our website.

These cookies let you:

     * adapt the advertising content displayed on your device in our
       advertising space based on the personal data you provided;
     * receive our personalised tips and offers based on your source
       browser (for example, if you arrived via our partner websites);
     * adapt our advertising space content to the display preferences of
       your device (language used, display resolution, operating system,
       etc.);
     * adapt the advertising content displayed on your device by our
       advertising space, depending on how your device browses our
       website;
     * adapt the advertising content displayed in our advertising space on
       your device depending on the location data (longitude and latitude)
       sent by your device with your prior agreement.

   In particular, we use DART tags by Google DoubleClick to distribute
   personalised content in banners on third-party websites. As part of
   advertising partnerships, we may transmit information on the content
   you viewed on our website to partners working on our behalf.

   We also use Weborama tags. Weborama tags are used to distribute
   personalised content on our websites and applications as well as on
   third-party sites in banners, paid listing ads or emails. They may also
   be used to compare browsing data with personal data when the user is
   identified, in order to personalise our communications.

   We make sure that partner companies process the data collected on our
   sites in compliance with our instructions and France’s Data Protection
   Act of 6 January 1978, subsequently amended, and that they agree to
   implement appropriate measures to ensure data security and protect
   confidentiality.

Cookies for sharing on social media

   Our website pages include social plug-ins for sharing content on social
   media (Facebook, Twitter, Scoop It, etc.).

   Using these share buttons sets a third-party cookie. If you are
   connected to social media when you browse our site, the share buttons
   let you link the content viewed to your user account.

ACCEPTING OR DECLINING COOKIES: WHAT’S THE PROCEDURE?

Your browser settings

   You can disable these cookies at any time. You can also change the
   settings on your browser to tell you when cookies are placed on your
   computer and to accept or decline them. You can accept or decline
   cookies on a case-by-case basis or decline them all.

   Remember that your settings may change the terms of access to our
   services requiring the use of cookies.

   If your browser is configured to decline all cookies, you will not be
   able to take advantage of essential website functions, such as
   receiving personalised recommendations. To manage cookies in a way that
   suits your needs, we suggest you take account of the purpose of the
   cookies, as described above, when configuring your browser.

   Each browser is configured differently. Use the help menu of your
   browser to see how to change your cookie preferences. Check the home
   page of your browser for cookie management settings.

   Depending on the browser, several options are available, e.g.: delete
   existing cookies, block some cookies, delete cookies on closing the
   browser or refuse all tracking by the website. You can also apply
   exceptions to a general rule for a given website.

   The corresponding pages are as follows:

   IE (top-right menu to select version)
   Chrome
   Firefox
   Safari (Mac)
   Opera

   If your browser (or your browser version) is not in the list, you can
   find more detailed information on the manufacturer’s website.

   Nevertheless, we draw your attention to the fact that a refusal cookie
   is installed on your device when you refuse the setting or use of a
   cookie. If you delete this refusal cookie, you will no longer be
   recognised as having refused the use of cookies.

Configuring the settings on a cookie management platform

   You can manage your cookies by visiting the cookie management platforms
   run by advertising companies.

   You can log on to the website www.youronlinechoices.eu set up by online
   advertising companies as part of the European Interactive Digital
   Advertising Alliance (EDAA) and managed in France by the Interactive
   Advertising Bureau France.

   This will tell you which companies are members of this platform. You
   can accept or decline the cookies used by these companies to adapt the
   advertising displayed on your device based on your browsing
   information:

   http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices

   This European platform is shared by hundreds of online advertising
   companies. It is a central interface that lets you decline or accept
   the cookies likely to be used to adapt the advertising displayed on
   your device based on your browsing information. Note that advertising
   will still be displayed on the websites you visit. This procedure will
   block only the technologies used to adapt advertising to your centres
   of interest.
