The Spice House: Pioneering How People Buy Spices

   In 1957, Ruth and Bill Penzey got married and settled into a new life
   in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They opened and ran a local shop that sold
   hand-ground spices and hot cups of coffee that grew to be known as The
   Spice House. After a letter carrier realized that local restaurants
   were having a hard time getting premium spices to their kitchens, The
   Spice House as we know it was born.

   In the early days of ecommerce, there wasn’t a simple way to sell spice
   online. In 2004, they pioneered the digital spice-selling world and
   built their own website to grow beyond mail-order and get their premium
   spices into the hands of more folks.

   Today, The Spice House has splurged from local spice shop to global
   ecommerce store selling well over 400 different spices, blends, rubs,
   and extracts made fresh in-house.

   Owners Tom and Patty hold the person-to-person experience of grinding,
   experiencing, and understanding the spices and their nuances in their
   brick-and-mortar stores close to their hearts, so when it comes to
   selling online, upholding that personal experience is critical.

     "What we sell you is not only the best quality of spices, but the
     experience of getting to learn where the spices come from, how
     they're manufactured, everything that you need to know about the
     spice."
     Charlie, The Spice House CEO

   Without the ability to smell, feel, or taste spices online, any new
   strategy adopted by The Spice House had to create memorable experiences
   in other ways. They needed to find a way to enhance every customer
   journey and make their store a unique staple for every customer. While
   replicating such a sensory experience is a heavy lift, the Spice House
   found that it’s an ask fit for Drip ECRM.

Old-World Product Is Met with New-World Marketing

   With a website that had been cobbled together through the years and an
   email service provider that couldn’t keep up with marketing strategies
   they wanted to try, The Spice house was looking for a big change to
   keep ahead of the competition.

   In 2016, they launched a new (very handsome) website to make shopping
   for spices a better user experience, but they were still facing the
   limitations of their current ESP.

   Before Drip, the team at The Spice House had only really been sending
   one-off broadcast emails to all the people on their email list. An
   update here and there, plus promotional offers and coupons.

   And if the offer was exceptionally enticing?

   “If we had a good offer, we would actually break our fulfillment
   system. We wouldn't be able to handle all the orders that we got.”
   That’s right. Without the ability to segment their list and “drip” out
   emails to different segments over a span of time, they were clogging
   their system and breaking their warehouse.

   While their ESP did a nice job helping The Spice House grow their email
   list from just a couple thousand to 100,000 people, it seemed to have
   reached its limit. They realized that as long as they were using an
   ESP, they weren’t getting the support they needed to segment customers,
   send triggered emails, and take full advantage of automation.

     We were in a situation where we needed to change quickly, and we
     needed to see results quickly.

   The Spice House was looking to scale without compromising the customer
   experience, so they started a hunt for a new tool that could help them
   out.

The Spice House Finds Drip Ecommerce CRM

   “We knew that we wanted to have a better email solution, and we knew
   that we wanted it integrated with our ecommerce site. And that brought
   us to Drip.”

   When it came to finding a fresh email marketing solution, The Spice
   House needed a solution that would enhance the customer experience
   while empowering them to segment, automate, and personalize their
   messages—oh, and let them continue to scale at a rapid pace.

   The tech folks at The Spice House explored Drip and knew it was the
   right move from the very beginning. Drip was friendly enough for their
   team to hook up and get running in a matter of weeks instead of months,
   which means they could start seeing results faster than anticipated.

     We knew that we wanted to have a better email solution, and we knew
     that we wanted it integrated with our ecommerce site. And that
     brought us to Drip.
     Charlie Mayer Chief Executive Officer

The Customer Relationship Management Tool The Spice House Needed

   The tools The Spice House had used forced them to treat all their
   customers like one big glob—all with the same interests, experiences,
   and buying patterns. But once Drip came on, they unlocked how to gain
   valuable customer insights, get closer to people in their journeys, and
   optimize strategies using the data they collect every step of the way.
   See some ECRM features they’ve focused on since starting with Drip.

Data for Days

   The Spice House is always looking for data that reflects a customer’s
   long-term relationship with the company, like lifetime value, so they
   can suss out patterns in behavior and optimize marketing strategies.
   Drip was able to help The Spice House bring in all the customer data
   they had amassed since 2004 (remember, from their very first ecommerce
   website?), so they had a lot to build off of from the start

Integrations for Multi-channel Marketing

   The Spice House has been practicing some best practices for years now,
   like search engine optimization and updating their website. But they’ve
   recently started taking a serious look at Facebook as a way to sell
   more spices and build up their community.

   Drip’s integrations with Facebook Lead Ads and Facebook Custom
   Audiences are just a couple of the ways The Spice House can create a
   truly personalized multi-channel experience.

Segments for Everybody

   ESPs treat everyone on an email list the same. They fail to realize the
   nuances in each person’s interests and values and journey, which
   doesn’t work for any marketing strategy that wants to see a fruitful
   tomorrow.

   With Drip, The Spice House is able to see everyone’s lifetime value,
   products they’ve viewed, how long it’s been since they placed an order,
   if they’ve abandoned a cart, if they’re new to The Spice House, and
   beyond. The marketing automation team can drill deep into segments to
   understand behaviors and make campaigns and workflows that are relevant
   to specific groups of people.

     Then, they can zoom out and see the full-color picture—buying
     trends, broader behaviors, and more—to continually optimize
     strategies for the road ahead.

Personalization at Scale

   The more info The Spice House collects about every unique customer, the
   more segments they can build for every email, every offer, and every
   announcement. And when segments are niche, the messages being sent can
   be increasingly relevant, meaningful, and memorable.

   One way they’ve been putting personalization to use at scale is through
   varying messaging based on how engaged a customer is. The Spice House
   has been able to build segments based on people’s lifetime value, then
   send super targeted emails based on how engaged or loyal they’ve been
   with the brand. Top buyers receive a different message than folks who
   only buy once in a while, and both groups receive a different message
   than those who rarely come buy.

   This helps them build loyalty emails or win-back campaigns that are
   always running in the background and firing automatically.

Fun and Games

   The Spice House celebrates the fact that working in Drip isn’t
   half-bad. “Email marketing is not always fun and it's not always easy,”
   says Charlie, the CEO of The Spice House, “but the cool thing about
   Drip is that anybody can use it.”

   Diving into email marketing automation that works seamlessly with their
   storefront could have been a headache, but for Charlie, it’s been a fun
   and easy experience. Our team of ECRM success managers has been able to
   work closely with Charlie to understand his goals, answer his
   questions, and get him off and running.

     Drip is like Marketo for the common man. You don’t need an entire
     team to set this up.
     Charlie Mayer Chief Executive Officer

Drip ECRM Makes It Easy to Send Messages That Make Money

   Understanding your customers and establishing deeper relationships with
   them through learning and insight does a lot for an ecommerce store. It
   makes brands stand out, builds customer loyalty, leaves a good
   impression on first-time shoppers, and, in the end, earns more revenue
   than brands that stay cold and aloof.

   But don’t take our word for it. The Spice House has only been with Drip
   for 10 months and has already some huge wins like these:
     * The Spice House email list has increased by more than 40%. That
       means they’re able to build bonds with more folks than ever.
     * While revenue has grown at the same pace as their email list,
       online sales in February 2019 were up 90% compared with February
       2018—all in less than a year of using Drip.
     * Drip has driven so much business that The Spice House has reached
       the end of its capacity at its current warehouse.
     * They’ve sent more than one million messages per month since last
       October (four months prior to this interview). Those emails alone
       have driven $400,000 in revenue.
     * By sending an automated email that welcomes people who sign up for
       their newsletter with a 10%-off coupon, The Spice House has seen
       20,000 conversions in just 7 months.
     * The Spice House sent one email on the Saturday of President’s Day
       weekend and another on President’s Day itself and earned $93,500
       over the course of three days (Saturday through Monday).

     It's not just Drip and it's not just that we're awesome. It's that
     it's Drip hooked up with Google, hooked up with Facebook, hooked up
     with a great product and a great team.
     Charlie Mayer Chief Executive Officer

How The Spice House Looks to Love Customers in the Years Ahead

   The relationship between Drip and The Spice House is off to an awesome
   beginning. With the help of an ecommerce CRM platform, the
   spice-selling pioneer has been able to reach more people and spice up
   more lives.

   They’re already cozying up to customers with heart-felt, personalized
   experiences and seeing those experiences paying off for the better. Now
   that The Spice House is getting closer to customers than ever, what’s
   next?

   Beyond bringing people closer to The Spice House, they’re aiming to
   bring the sources of their spices into the mix. Their goods come from
   all around the globe, and by pulling back the curtain between suppliers
   and customers, people will feel closer than ever to The Spice House’s
   story.

     “What matters more these days, and we believe this when we sell
     spices, is that the relationship you have with your customers has to
     be the most important. And I feel that Drip and The Spice House
     share that.”

ECRM.

   with Drip.

Data-driven Ecommerce

   Headquartered in Portland, OR, is an ecommerce agency that’s been
   honing the art of combining data and human experiences online. Meet
   Y-Verge.

   As a small shop, Y-Verge has been perfecting how to run efficiently and
   scale smoothly as it carries out its mission of helping ecommerce
   brands stand out in a crowded industry. But with more brands opening up
   shop and Amazon gobbling up a fatter slice of the ecommerce pie daily,
   how does Y-Verge help Shopify stores and keep customers?

   The answer: Data. Info. Deets. Cold, hard facts, and the perfect tool
   to use them all—ECRM.

   By paying attention to the actions and details of their ecommerce
   clients’ customers—what they’re ogling, what they’re shopping for, what
   they’re buying, and beyond—this agency crafts fool-proof ecommerce
   strategies that 2X, 3X, or 20X business.

Ecommerce Is a $3,000,000,000,000 Industry

   That’s a pretty big number, and they say ecommerce is just getting
   warmed up.

   If that growth makes your palms a little sweaty, that’s OK. Helping
   Shopify stores navigate (and thrive in) this industry in the face of
   mounting competition and big names like Amazon is why the people at
   Y-Verge do what they do every day.

   They’re making the landscape less scary by educating Shopify store
   owners and implementing strategies that help them stand out in
   ecommerce by combining meaningful marketing strategies with the best
   sources of data they already have access to—their customers.

     Drip is the Tesla of marketing automation.
     Leon Yeh Chief Executive Officer

Shopify Stores Can Finally Do More with Data

   Y-Verge is a data-driven agency, which means it’s not likely they’ll
   make any big decisions based on their proverbial gut. They know (and
   have proven) that the path to success for Shopify stores is less
   winding if data is involved every step of the way. This is where Drip,
   the ecommerce CRM advantage, comes in.

   They’ve tried pretty much every email marketing platform out there, but
   none were able to step up and provide the power they needed to gather
   incoming data and squeeze the strategic potential from every last drop
   of it.

   But when Y-Verge stumbled on Drip, it was game over. They found their
   game-changer.

Shopify Stores Stand out with Y-Verge

   Growing ecommerce competition means online shops have to do something a
   little different than the rest if they want to make it. One sure-fire
   way to stand out is to stick in the shoppers’ minds. Luckily, Y-Verge
   knows just how to make staying top-of-mind possible with Drip.

   exact items they want, and recommend some of your top-selling stuff in
   a journey made just for each unique customer.

   haul. Because they’re able to use data from multiple inputs and rely on
   proven strategies, Y-Verge knows exactly what to do for each Shopify
   store for longer stretches of time. No more throwing stuff at a wall to
   see if it sticks, if ya know what I mean.

     The customers are happy and the brand owner is happy. It’s a
     win-win!
     Leon Yeh Chief Executive Officer

Y-Verge Finds Focus and Speed with Drip

   Before Drip, the folks at Y-Verge were writing complex code, cobbling
   together their own databases, and manually assembling tricky campaigns
   that would resonate across marketing channels. But those dark, dark
   days are long gone.

   Since starting with Drip, Y-Verge has seen a lot big strides. They’ve
   experienced the benefits of things like:

   colorful interconnected blobs.

Data that talks between tools.

   Drip helps all the tools Y-Verge uses talk to each other. With direct
   pipelines of data from Facebook to Instagram to Shopify and email,
   Y-Verge is able to build their clients perfectly timed and relevant
   marketing campaigns unique to every customer.

Agency efficiency at its finest.

   What used to be hours of tedious manual setup for every client they
   worked with is now ready to go. Intuitive automations, visual
   workflows, and more can be made into essential templates that can be
   shared across accounts. At least 80% of what Y-Verge used to do
   manually is now streamlined with Drip, which saves time—lots of time.

Your Best Food Friend

   Bite Squad is a food delivery service headquartered in midwestern
   metropolis Minneapolis, Minnesota (say that 10 times fast). Noticing a
   serious lack of variety across the delivery food wasteland of yore, the
   idea of Bite Squad was born. It was founded on the desire to bring
   people the exact dish they’re craving from any restaurant, even if it’s
   not the typical delivery fares of pizza or Chinese.

   Bite Squad’s been busting food delivery barriers since 2012, and now
   with its latest customer loyalty program, Bite Club, they’re on a quest
   to smash every email marketing automation goal you can think of.

Not Your Mother’s Food Delivery

   Food delivery is exploding. With new delivery services creeping into
   every big city, it’s a critical time for each business to make a
   lasting impression with hungry patrons.

   By the year 2022, the food delivery biz is predicted to have an annual
   growth rate of nearly 20%. To add to the pressure of keeping up, it’s
   been found that 80% of customers never or rarely leave one platform for
   another, creating a heated “winner-takes-all” dynamic.

   Bite Squad has seen its own tremendous growth, though, and has recently
   expanded to 30 markets across the U.S. with plans to tackle more as
   2018 moves on. So how does Bite Squad plan to win over the stomachs of
   the hungry? Say “Hey!” to Bite Club.

   “Hey!” to Bite Club.

   Bite Squad’s loyalty program is hot outta the oven, but is already
   making a big impact on their stake in the food delivery game.

     When we have that level of data, we get to know you. We get to know
     your tastes. We get to know that you love Thai food on Friday
     nights, but you’re into burger and fries on Sunday afternoons.

Drip Makes Deep Personalization Possible in Bite Club

   Bite Club, in a nutshell, rewards users for coming back by way of
   charismatic badges and other incentives. Not only do you get handsomely
   rewarded for hitting various order milestones (Woohoo! You’ve ordered
   10 meals!), but your collection of badges grows when you choose new
   cuisine, order at obscure times, and hit other creative foodie
   landmarks.

   Bite Club isn’t fueled by magic, though. Instead, this engaging loyalty
   club gets its secret sauce straight from Drip. Drip makes it possible
   for Bite Club to deliver badges automatically when customers hit
   milestones by keeping track of what every customer is up to.

   they've received a new badge in the Bite Club. A screenshot of a Bite

     Because of Drip, I’m able to see at a very high level, how our
     overall email communication is performing, how we’re making
     decisions about when, where, and why to reach customers.
     Craig Key Chief Marketing Officer

Drip helps Bite Squad track all of this stuff about customers:

     * When they last placed an order
     * What restaurant they ordered from
     * If they ordered a meal for themself or
        many meals for lots of pals
     * What specific dish they ordered
     * What specific cuisine they ordered
     * And much more

   With such a deep vat of customer data, Bite Club is able to dole out
   badges and rewards at the exact moment the customer is most engaged
   with the brand, which creates a completely delightful experience that
   has their customers craving more.

Hyper-Specific Messaging Boosts Email Opens, Order Rates, and Sheer Joy

   With the insight Drip is able to dish out, Bite Squad communicates with
   each customer way beyond “Hello, {{ subscriber.first_name }}.”

   The team at Bite Squad has built a clever network of automated
   workflows that are constantly working to pull customers in and out of
   the most relevant experiences based on what actions they’re taking.

   Just signed up? Awesome—Bite Squad’s warm welcome workflows will take
   care of you.

   Just placed your third order? You’ll be automatically plunked into Bite
   Club where you’ll start triggering badges, coupons, yummy-looking
   emails for nearby food, and beyond.

   This precise level of personalization has done some seriously heavy
   lifting, too. In just the first couple months of Bite Club’s existence,
   hyper-targeted communication has proven to be a grand slam.

     We have a dynamic landing page, a completely personalized email, a
     semi-gamified loyalty program, and I don’t know any JavaScript.
     That’s amazing.

Bite Squad Reaches Beyond Email with Drip’s Integrations

   Being able to tag, segment, and target each unique customer with
   tailored emails has engaged and delighted customers more than ever. But
   Drip is helping complete Bite Squad’s total marketing automation
   package.

   Beyond an impressive email strategy, Bite Squad also uses Drip to pull
   customers in and out of Facebook custom audiences based on their order
   history. Landing pages built in Leadpages are completely personalized
   to each customer based on information inside of Drip. And Bite Squad
   even employs Drip’s API integration for a smart direct mail strategy.

     There’s this combination of a team at Bite Squad who was thinking
     outside the box and pushing for innovation and ways to connect with
     the customer that we had never done before, and you had a team at
     Drip that was just willing to say, ‘Ok, let’s figure this out!’
     Craig Key Chief Marketing Officer

The All-in-one Platform for Every Form of Communication

   Not only does Bite Squad use the marketing automation powers of Drip to
   drive Bite Club, but it also employs tagging and segmentation
   capabilities to communicate with the thousands of drivers and
   restaurants in their network.

   As Bite Squad keeps growing, so too does their roster of tasty options
   and their fleet of bag-toting drivers—all of which need to be kept in
   the loop. Instead of tacking on a separate email service provider for
   these types of “internal” communications, Bite Squad is able to use
   Drip just as easily.

   It’s their all-in-one communication hub, which saves time and money.
