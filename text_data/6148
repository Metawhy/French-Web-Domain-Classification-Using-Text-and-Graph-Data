   Burke, founder of a nonprofit that helps survivors of sexual violence,
   created the Me Too movement in 2006 to encourage young women to show
   solidarity with one another. It went viral this year after actor Alyssa
   Milano used the hashtag #MeToo. "Sexual harassment does bring shame.

   these women are able not just to share their shame but to put the shame
   where it belongs: on the perpetrator."
