Album of the Week

Portico Quartet – Memory Streams

   Portico Quartet have never once been a group content to seek comfort in
   the past. Each release has showcased a keen sensibility to hack at
   their own path through the world of jazz fusion, if their realm can
   even be recognised as such. Their lexicon of sound is multifarious,
   levelling trip hop and hip hop alongside post-rock mutability. Despite
   a slight return to a more band-oriented form than previous releases,
   Memory Streams is electrified by singular nodes of unease, a great
   landscape of tumultuous drums and whirring, circular percussion,
   rendered inexplicably alien by the most familiar of jazz instruments:
   the saxophone.

   Nina Kraviz's TRIP presents Don't Mess With Cupid, 'Cause Cupid Ain't
   Stupid, a double 12" compilation featuring AFX under the Universal
   Indicator alias with 15 c7 is pure Rephlex acid techno of the mid 90s
   variety.

   Loaded up with uncertified bangers from the extended TRIP family,
   alongside AFX there are tracks from PTU, Bjarki, Pilldriver, Shadowax,
   Roma Zuckerman, Exos, DEKA and of course, Nina Kraviz herself.
   Highlights include the rather rubbery electro of Biogen's Hexagraphic,
   the dark garage twist of Exos Grasshunter, the Rhythm & Sound on a
   summer holiday of Roma Zuckerman's wavey 'Zero' and of course the
   classic acid AFX of '15 c7' - summer scorchers all round!

   Consider this a new innovation in the dynamics of acid.

   East London's newly-minted label Nervous Horizon drop their debut
   release by WALLWORK & RZR. For an opening offering, these four cuts
   display a commitment to providing soundtracks for the darker dance
   floors of the UK. The bare-bones jungle breakbeat of Parrot Honey and
   the chopped up vocal sample employed on Don’t Panic all come straight
   from producers raised on British club culture. An introduction to a
   label hellbent on rattling the nightspots in the early hours.
