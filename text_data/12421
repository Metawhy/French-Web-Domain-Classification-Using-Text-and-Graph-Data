   will be represented by dynamic graphics, for an innovative and more

   Account, billing and payment
   In order to submit a campaign, Advertiser’s must fill in billing and
   contact information. It is mandatory that billing information, such as
   Company Name, Address and VAT, are submitted according to the company’s
   legal and financial standards. Advertisers must ensure that the
   information provided to Emailbidding is true and accurate, and are

   Advertisers will pay for each unique click generated through
   Emailbidding Advertising Platform. The monthly campaigns cost is
   available on the billing area. This value may be subjected to a few
   minutes delay.
   Due to the nature of email marketing campaigns, (depending on the
   recipient behavior, one e-mail might be sent in one month and only
   opened and clicked in the following month) the amount of clicks
   invoiced are related to the clicks generated in that specific month.
   Once the campaign’s defined time frame ends, all further clicks
   generated within the next 30 will also be invoiced.
   The invoices will be issued and sent by e-mail to the Advertisers in
   the first days of the following month. Payment shall be remitted to
   Emailbidding within 10 days from invoice date by wire transfer to the
   bank account displayed in the invoice. Campaigns might be temporary
   suspended if the payment is not received within the defined period by
