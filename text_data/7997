   Read some of our latest customer testimonials

   Gianmaria and the team at Amnesty International UK use Skedda for event
   scheduling in their busy office.

   “Skedda has been a godsend, it's made managing the meeting rooms in our
   venue a seamless, enjoyable experience.”
   Amnesty International

Gianmaria Bandiera

   Amnesty International - London, U.K

   “Skedda is a deceivingly powerful space-management solution made simple
   by an intuitive user interface. As a theatre with an incredibly dynamic
   schedule and a variety of needs, Skedda has all but eliminated
   space-scheduling conflicts. This has had an important positive impact
   on departmental cooperation and employee morale.”
   The Blue Man Group

Alex

   The Blue Man Group - Chicago, U.S

   “These guys have made our lives so much easier and bookings have
   actually increased since we made everything online and automated.
   Genius. Thanks so much Skedda team, you've really made our lives so
   much easier here :). Keep up the good work!”
   Academy Studios

Harriette Hale

   Academy Studios - London, U.K

   “We use Skedda in four workspaces; Split, Lisbon, Marrakesh and Cape
   Town. Our travelling communities find it quick to view which meeting
   rooms and phone booths are free on a daily basis. Before Skedda we were
   using Google Calendars to manage rooms. Now, we are able to centralize
   the workspaces which helps our growing communities book without
   interrupting their workflow or crowding their work calendar.”
   Remote Year

Mike

   Remote Year, Global

   “Our business manages a sports venue with a wide variety of sporting
   facilities. As such, it can be complicated to link in the various
   facilities together so that it remains user friendly whilst also being
   functional. Skedda has managed to help achieve this and I have found
   that they have always responded in a timely manner with all our queries
   too.”
