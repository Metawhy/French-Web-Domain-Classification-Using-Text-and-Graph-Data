   Who Is Winning the AI Race: China, the EU or the United States?

   The United States leads the race for global advantage in artificial

   Global Trade Interdependence: U.S. Trade Linkages With Korea, Mexico,
   and Taiwan

   Korea, Mexico, and Taiwan represent vital trade partners for the United
   States, not only as destinations for U.S. exports, but more importantly
   as key partners whose firms supply critical intermediate goods on which
   the health of America’s advanced-technology industries depend.

   policy at home and abroad.
   Digital Services Taxes: A Bad Idea Whose Time Should Never Come
   Digital Services Taxes: A Bad Idea Whose Time Should Never Come

   Arguments used to justify digital services taxes on large Internet
   companies are flawed. The United States should counter these proposals
   and work to restore international consensus around tax treatment for
   multinational companies.
   Principles and Policies for “Data Free Flow With Trust”
   Principles and Policies for “Data Free Flow With Trust”

   The foundation of the global digital economy is showing cracks.

   How Stringent Export Controls on Emerging Technologies Would Harm the
   U.S. Economy

   Depending on how restrictive export controls are, U.S. firms could lose

   the missed export opportunities threatening from 18,000 to 74,000 jobs.

   Algorithmic Economy
   The EU Needs to Reform the GDPR To Remain Competitive in the
   Algorithmic Economy

   Europe’s success in the global algorithmic economy requires a
   regulatory environment that is fit for AI but does not reduce consumer
   protections.
   The Way Forward for Intellectual Property Internationally
   The Way Forward for Intellectual Property Internationally

   Countries with robust IP rights and protections must recognize that new
   energy, new tactics, and a new strategy are needed to encourage other
   nations to contribute more and detract less from global innovation.

   Is China Catching Up to the United States in Innovation?
   Is China Catching Up to the United States in Innovation?

   If China were only a copier, then the competitive threat to advanced
   economies would be limited. But there is no reason to believe China
   won’t follow the path of “Asian tigers” that rapidly evolved from
   copiers to innovators, which poses a serious threat.
   The Case Against Taxing Robots
   The Case Against Taxing Robots

   Given that the economy has been in an unprecedented productivity growth
   slump—and the baby boom retirement wave is rising—taxing automation
   equipment ranks as a singularly bad policy idea.

   the Metal
   FY 2020 Energy Innovation Funding: Congress Should Push the Pedal to
   the Metal

   The Trump administration has once again proposed massive cuts to energy
   RD&D. Lawmakers should not give this year’s budget proposal any greater
   credence than they have given the last two. Congress should instead
   continue down the path of elevating innovation in clean energy as a
   national priority.

   and Lower Costs
   Healthy Funding: The Critical Role of Investing in NIH to Boost Health
   and Lower Costs

   NIH funding is critical to improving health outcomes and reducing the
   societal costs of illnesses. Congress should increase the NIH budget
   and then maintain regular, steady increases.
   Big Is Beautiful: Debunking the Myth of Small Business
   Big Is Beautiful: Debunking the Myth of Small Business

   This provocative new book now available from The MIT Press shows small
   businesses are not the drivers of our prosperity. Big firms are better
   for job creation, productivity, innovation, and most other economic
   benefits. Governments should stop tipping the scales toward small and
   adopt “size neutral” policies that encourage companies of all sizes to
   grow.

   The Task Ahead of Us: Transforming the Global Economy With
   Connectivity, Automation, and Intelligence

   The next wave of digital innovation is coming. Countries can welcome
   it, prepare for it, and ride it to new heights of innovation and
   prosperity, or they can ignore the changing tide and miss the wave.

   Strategies
   Think Like an Enterprise: Why Nations Need Comprehensive Productivity
   Strategies

   Productivity is the key to improving living standards—so policymakers
   should ignore conventional economists who say there is little
   government can do about it and instead make it the principal goal of
   economic policy.

   High-Tech Nation: How Technological Innovation Shapes America’s 435
   Congressional Districts

   America’s innovation-driven, high-tech economy isn’t concentrated
   around a few hubs like Silicon Valley; it is widely diffused—and every
