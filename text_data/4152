A Profiling Primer

   By Tony Albrecht.

   The most interesting thing about this port is the optimisation feat
   ahead of us. Vessel was already (mostly) running on the PS3 at the
   start, but needed to run much, much faster. So, where does one begin?
   The first thing you need to do, is profile it – if you don’t know where
   the program is slow (or why) then you can’t optimise it. But in order
   for me to be able to talk about profiling and optimisation, I’ll need
   to delve (briefly) into the profiling tools on the PS3 (If you’re an
   experienced PS3 dev, then your probably familiar with this information
   – skip ahead, I won’t mind). Here’s a screen capture of part of the
   tool I use for PlayStation3 profiling (SN System’s excellent Tuner –
   comfortably the best profiler I’ve used)

   a1sx2_Thumbnail1_First-Capture

   Like all the best profilers, it has lots of colourful bars (the PS2
   Performance Analyser was awesome like that too). Colourful bars are
   crucial for dazzling and confusing artists who may wander by and happen
   to glance at your monitor. The top of the screen has a time line in
   seconds – you can see it ends at 0.073, or 73ms. Yup, that’s right,
   73ms. (Note that in this blog I will almost always use milliseconds
   rather than frame per second. Frames per second is a useless metric
   only used by teenage boys who like to put lights inside their PCs).

   The display is broken up into roughly 3 parts that we can see here.
   Each group of horizontal bars corresponds to a thread (click on the
   image to see it in higher resolution in another window). The top thread
   is the Physics thread, the next the Game thread and then the Render
   thread.

   a1sx2_Original1_DetailedPhysicsThread

   The top, segmented bar is the overall thread usage. When the thread
   isn’t running (like at the start during the stall for sync) you’ll see
   a gap or a bar indicating an OS function (like a mutex or even fileIO).
   The colourful collection of bars beneath that are the result of marking
   up important functions in the code base with calls that tell the
   profiler when the function starts and stops. The longer the bar, the
   more time it takes. Bars that appear under other bars indicate function
   calls from that parent. For example, WaterTime calls
   MoveWaterFromInternalPressure which calls ApplyViscosity and the
   functions that call DoubleDensityRelaxation and then ProcessSkeletons.
   It is a very powerful way to view the flow of your code and I often
   find myself using Tuner just to see how a foreign codebase flows. For
   those of you out there who don’t have access to the PS3 devkits or
   Tuner, you can use Chrome Tracing to read the output of your profiling
   in JSON format and display it in your browser (assuming of course, that
   your browser is Chrome).

   So, basically, the longer the bar the longer the function it represents
   takes to run. Now, how do we choose which bar to optimise?

   Generally, when looking for what to optimise first, I try and find
   something easy, something obvious. Occasionally you’ll get lucky and
   make a simple fix that will save milliseconds – check your compilation
   options (you wouldn’t believe how often people miss one
   library/project), check that your code is inlining properly (check the
   generated assembly), look for lots of string based functions as well as
   intra frame allocations – basically make sure that everything you’re
   seeing makes sense and that there are no piles of stupid lying around.
   There are two ideal candidates for optimisation: One function that does
   a lot of processing or one or more small functions that are called a
   lot.

   There is another feature of Tuner (and most other good profilers) and
   that is Program Counter sampling. Program Counter (PC) sampling is done
   by the profiler reading the program counter register to get an
   indication of which line of code is being executed at that time. The
   more times a particular line is sampled, the more often it is being
   executed – on PC the free Very Sleepy does a good job of this. You’ll
   either get a hierarchical view of the functions being called, or a flat
   view of what is being called when – like in the following image:

   a1sx2_Original1_PhysicsWithPCSampling

   The red and blue marks correspond to samples that are performed during
   the frame. On the left you can see the names of the functions that the
   samples have occurred in. In Tuner you can also drill down into the
   actual functions and see which lines and even which assembly
   instructions have samples attributed to them. This allows you to find
   hotspots – sections of the code that are called a lot and contribute
   heavily to the cost of each frame.

   Tuner has a lot of additional functionality that I won’t go into here –
   this should be enough to help you to understand captures that myself
   and Ben will post over the upcoming weeks.

   In my next post I’ll be looking in detail at the optimisation of one of
   the sections of the Physics thread. I’ll just say this; my initial hope
   was that I could gain a lot of performance back by simply rearranging
   memory and minimising memory allocation in the physics code. That hope
   was very quickly and resoundingly dashed – this wasn’t going to be an
   easy task.

A Profiling Primer

   By Tony Albrecht.

   The most interesting thing about this port is the optimisation feat
   ahead of us. Vessel was already (mostly) running on the PS3 at the
   start, but needed to run much, much faster. So, where does one begin?
   The first thing you need to do, is profile it – if you don’t know where
   the program is slow (or why) then you can’t optimise it. But in order
   for me to be able to talk about profiling and optimisation, I’ll need
   to delve (briefly) into the profiling tools on the PS3 (If you’re an
   experienced PS3 dev, then your probably familiar with this information
   – skip ahead, I won’t mind). Here’s a screen capture of part of the
   tool I use for PlayStation3 profiling (SN System’s excellent Tuner –
   comfortably the best profiler I’ve used)

   a1sx2_Thumbnail1_First-Capture

   Like all the best profilers, it has lots of colourful bars (the PS2
   Performance Analyser was awesome like that too). Colourful bars are
   crucial for dazzling and confusing artists who may wander by and happen
   to glance at your monitor. The top of the screen has a time line in

   73ms. (Note that in this blog I will almost always use milliseconds
   rather than frame per second. Frames per second is a useless metric
   only used by teenage boys who like to put lights inside their PCs).

   The display is broken up into roughly 3 parts that we can see here.
   Each group of horizontal bars corresponds to a thread (click on the
   image to see it in higher resolution in another window). The top thread
   is the Physics thread, the next the Game thread and then the Render
   thread.

   a1sx2_Original1_DetailedPhysicsThread

   The top, segmented bar is the overall thread usage. When the thread
   isn’t running (like at the start during the stall for sync) you’ll see
   a gap or a bar indicating an OS function (like a mutex or even fileIO).
   The colourful collection of bars beneath that are the result of marking
   up important functions in the code base with calls that tell the
   profiler when the function starts and stops. The longer the bar, the
   more time it takes. Bars that appear under other bars indicate function
   calls from that parent. For example, WaterTime calls
   MoveWaterFromInternalPressure which calls ApplyViscosity and the
   functions that call DoubleDensityRelaxation and then ProcessSkeletons.
   It is a very powerful way to view the flow of your code and I often
   find myself using Tuner just to see how a foreign codebase flows. For
   those of you out there who don’t have access to the PS3 devkits or
   Tuner, you can use Chrome Tracing to read the output of your profiling
   in JSON format and display it in your browser (assuming of course, that
   your browser is Chrome).

   So, basically, the longer the bar the longer the function it represents
   takes to run. Now, how do we choose which bar to optimise?

   Generally, when looking for what to optimise first, I try and find
   something easy, something obvious. Occasionally you’ll get lucky and
   make a simple fix that will save milliseconds – check your compilation

   either get a hierarchical view of the functions being called, or a flat
   view of what is being called when – like in the following image:

   The red and blue marks correspond to samples that are performed during
   the frame. On the left you can see the names of the functions that the
   samples have occurred in. In Tuner you can also drill down into the
   actual functions and see which lines and even which assembly

       “Frames per second is a useless metric only used by teenage boys
       who like to put lights inside their PCs”
       That’s a great quote right there 🙂

Our goal at Strange Loop Games is to use the massive power of today’s
hardware for gameplay, not just graphics. We use deep, interactive
simulations to explore the boundaries of what can be done within a game.

Augmenting the Classroom

   Evolving Education Though Virtual Field-Trips. Perhaps the most
   impressive thing about the Pokemon Go phenomenon is its speed; in a
   week, it was used more than Twitter.  It was an idea the world was
   ready for, packaged in a form that was easily approachable.  It speaks
   to the acceptance we already have of the digital…

How to Save the Environment by Letting Kids Destroy It

   This year’s Earth Day has given us a chance to reflect how the
   environment is more threatened than it has ever been. Worst of all,
   this is all occurring with indisputable evidence of the causes,
   dangers, and solutions to climate change readily available. The fact
   that climate deniers can still triumph in light of vast…

Eco Wins the Climate Challenge

   We’re honored to announce that Eco won the grand prize in the Climate
   Challenge in New York!  In Eco players are tasked with building a
   civilization together in a simulated ecosystem, where they can have a
   huge impact on the environment and climate.

Eco at the White House

   ​Because Eco is a Department of Education grant winner, we had the
   amazing opportunity last week to visit the White House and talk about
   the role of games in education with leaders from industry and
   government. Afterwards we ran a demo of Eco at the nearby 1776
   Incubator, showing to officials and policy-makers what we…

Announcing A New World

   Our next project is called Eco, and it’s a game in a new genre we’re
   calling a Global Survival Game. What does that mean exactly?  It means
   you play in a multiplayer world that has the possibility of being
   permanently destroyed, resulting in server-wide perma death.  What’s
   more, the reason it’s destroyed would be the…

‘You Have Died of Dysentery’: How Games Will Revolutionize Education

   What do you know about the Oregon Trail?  I’m willing to be that your
   knowledge on the subject is gained almost entirely from the
   thusly-named game, where your typical quest across the country saw your
   resources dwindle, your family members drop one by one from accidents
   and disease, ending all too often with words ‘You…
