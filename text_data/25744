Outreach Storytime: Pets

   My turn to choose the theme at our grocery store storytime! I went with
   Pets since I really wanted to re-use my new flannelboard for My Bus.

The Plan

   Books

   Caring for Your Lion by Tammi Sauer*
   My Bus by Byron Barton*
   Stack the Cats by Susie Ghahremani*
   This Book Just Ate My Dog! by Richard Byrne
   What Pet to Get? by Emma Dodd*

   Extension Activities

   Flannelboard: “Dear Zoo”*

   Flannelboard: “My Bus”*

   Puppet & Song: “The Goldfish”*

   Puppet: “I Have a Little Turtle”*
   I have a little turtle (put hands on top of one another)
   He lives in a box (make box)
   He swims in a puddle (swimming motion)
   He climbs on the rocks (climbing motion)
   He snapped at a mosquito (clap)
   He snapped at a flea (clap)
   He snapped at a minnow (clap)
   And he snapped at me (clap)
   He caught the mosquito (cup hands together)
   He caught the flea (cup hands together)
   He caught the minnow (cup hands together)
   But he didn’t catch me! (shake finger “no”)
   Credit: Childhood

How It Went

   This was such a fun storytime! I did My Bus with the flannelboard and
   the kids loved being able to play the part of a dog or cat to board the
   bus. (To accommodate larger groups, I double or triple the amount of
   animals in the story. A bit of math, but it’s manageable.) Our most
   successful book was What Pet to Get? by Emma Dodd. The kids really
   enjoyed imagining different kinds of pets and I think the grown-ups
   appreciated the spot of humor at the end.

   I did have a storytime blunder today and completely miss-rhymed during
   “I Have a Little Turtle”. I’m not sure where my mind was! I think my
   favorite part of storytime was swimming along to Laurie Berkner’s “The
   Goldfish” song in the grocery store though. I highly recommend it!

Outreach Storytime: Interactive Stories

   I was so happy when one of my preschools asked for “Interactive
   Stories” as a theme because there are SO MANY good books that invite
   audience participation and movement!

The Plan

   Books

   Hop, Hop, Jump! by Lauren Thompson****
   The Mixed-Up Truck by Stephen Savage**
   Play This Book by Jessica Young*
   Shake the Tree! by Chiara Vignocchi****
   Ten in the Bed by Jane Cabrera***

   Extension Activities

   Flannelboard: “Going on a Bear Hunt”****

   Flannelboard: “Red Crane, Red Crane”**

   Prop Sticks: “Green Says Go”***

   Prop: Song Cube****

How It Went

   Preschool 1 (four classrooms)
   I got to read in this preschool’s library! Each classroom had their own
   storytime. Both The Mixed-Up Truck and Shake the Tree! worked well in
   every classroom. Hop, Hop, Jump got one class too riled up and their
   teachers had to redirect them a few times to make sure they gave their
   classmates enough space. The “Going on a Bear Hunt” flannelboard
   continues to be a massive success when paired with a hidden bear
   puppet. I actually didn’t use any rhymes or songs on their own, other
   than my opening/closing routines since the kids were up and moving the
   entire storytime. I would definitely repeat this theme again!

   Storytime

Outreach Storytime: Spring

   As it was seasonally appropriate, so many of my preschools and centers
   requested a “spring” theme. Needless to say, while this is a great
   storytime plan that worked well for every group that I visited, I’m
   very glad to put it away for the year.

The Plan

   Books

   Butterfly, Butterfly by Petr Horacek********
   Plant the Tiny Seed by Christie Matheson*******
   Splish, Splash Ducky! by Lucy Cousins******
   When Spring Comes by Kevin Henkes****
   Wow! Said the Owl by Tim Hopgood******

   Extension Activities

   Flannelboard: “Five Little Ducks”*******

   Flannelboard: “Planting a Rainbow”****

   Folder Story: “Old MacRainbow’s Flower Garden” (found at Fun With
   Friends at Storytime)****

   Puppet: Flutter, Flutter Butterfly********
   Flutter, flutter butterfly,
   Floating in the spring sky
   Floating by for all to see,
   Floating by so merrily
   Flutter, flutter butterfly,
   Floating in the spring sky
   Credit: Best Kids Book Site (site is down)

   ASL: “Butterfly”********

   Fingerplay: “Here is the Beehive”********
   Here is the beehive. (hold up fist)
   Where are the bees? (shrug)
   Hidden away where nobody sees. (move other hand around fist)
   Watch and you’ll see them come out of the hive (bend head close to
   fist)
   One, two, three, four, five. (hold fingers up one at a time)
   Bzzzzzzzz! (wave fingers)
   Credit: Co-worker at old library

How It Went

   Preschool 1: four classrooms
   At this preschool, I presented in one of the larger classrooms and
   different groups rotated to storytime. This preschool was enamored with
   Wow! Said the Owl and did the best job of remembering our secret code
   to say “WOW!” together. (I wave my hand at the group instead of
   pointing.) As always, Butterfly, Butterfly is a sure-fire win due to
   the pop-up page at the end. And it worked so well with our ASL sign!

   Preschool 2: two classrooms
   My friends at this school remained in their classrooms and I traveled.
   Since it was only two storytimes and their classrooms were right next
   to each other, it worked out. This group really responded to the
   planting element of spring. Their favorite activities were definitely
   the “Planting a Rainbow” flannelboard and the folder story. I really
   appreciated the teachers in this group because they carefully wrote
   down each book and I could tell that they were just as engaged in the
   storytime as the kids were.

   Preschool 3: eight classrooms (two per storytime)
   I had a lot of fabulous surprises at this preschool — mostly especially
   the “thank-you” notes that were given to me as each set of classrooms
   came for their storytime. I had a child notice the endpapers of Splish,
   Splash Ducky which led to a great conversation about authors and
   illustrators and why that book had a picture of a person on the inside
   cover. My friend asked me after every book if there were any more
   author/illustrator pictures and we checked every time. These groups
   *loved* singing “Five Little Ducks” with the flannelboard, as well as
   the “Flutter, Flutter Butterfly” puppet and rhyme. I extend this song
   now to other silly actions (jumping, spinning, hiding) and the kids
   love when the butterfly peeks out from behind me during the hiding
   verse.

Bookgarteners: Karen Beaumont

   For an overview of the Bookgarteners program, please visit this post.

   Karen Beaumont is an author that I think needs to have a larger
   following. So many of her books are storytime hits, that I wanted to
   call attention to her as an author for my kiddos.

Group Program

   To begin our program, I explained what an author was and what an
   illustrator was. I talked about how each book has one of each.
   Sometimes they are the same person and sometimes they are not. Karen
   Beaumont was the author of the books that I had chosen to highlight,
   but she worked with lots of different illustrators. One of my favorite
   connections was a preschooler that recognized David Catrow’s art from
   both I Ain’t Gonna Paint No More and I Like Myself!. We didn’t watch
   any YouTube videos because I couldn’t find any. Ms. Beaumont, please
   record some videos for your young fans!

   Afterwards, it was time to read Move Over, Rover! together.

   Sequence Cards with Move Over, Rover!
   2.B.ECb: With teacher assistance, retell familiar stories with three or
   more key events.

   I had originally wanted to make several flannelboard copies of the
   story for the kids to use in their retelling, but time got the best of
   me this past spring and I opted instead to purchase a set from Teachers
   Pay Teachers which included story character cards that I used as
   sequencing cards. Each child got their own pack and we worked through
   the story together. I was impressed at their recall for the order of
   the animals!
     __________________________________________________________________

Activity Stations

   Four activity stations were spread out around the room. I had one adult
   volunteer in the room with me to help control the flow of kiddos.
   (You’ll notice that I changed from a teen to an adult volunteer at this
   program. Ultimately, it was too much for one teen volunteer to handle
   and I was unable to get two teens during the after-school time.)

   Do-a-Dot Marker on the Wall for I Ain’t Gonna Paint No More
   25.A.ECd: Visual Arts. Investigate and participate in activities using
   visual arts materials.

   This wall art activity was inspired by TeachPreschool, via Pinterest. I
   simply had to let them paint on the wall, right? TeachPreschool’s blog
   post is amazing, with tons of great art content. Since I was doing this
   activity in another program, I chose to make it a bit tidier with
   do-a-dot markers and large post-it notes. And the great part was I
   could change the “canvas” with each child so they got to take their
   pictures home.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Music Dancing with Baby Danced the Polka
   19.B.ECa: Coordinate movements to perform complex tasks.
   19.B.ECc: Combine large motor movements with and without the use of
   equipment.
   25.A.ECa: Movement and Dance. Build awareness of, explore, and
   participate in dance and creative movement activities.
   25.A.ECc: Music. Begin to appreciate and participate in music
   activities.

   This idea came from my own head. I love music and I love exposing
   children to different kinds of music. Baby Danced the Polka gave me an
   opportunity to play some polka music and dance around the room with the
   kids. We did wind up playing a rousing edition of Freeze Dance as well,
   inspired by the lead of some of the kids.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I Like Me/All About Me Paper for I Like Myself!
   5.A.Eca: Experiment with writing tools and materials.
   5.B.ECa: With teacher assistance, use a combination of drawing,
   dictating, or writing to express an opinion about a book or topic.
   16.A.ECb: Develop a basic awareness of self as an individual.
   30.B.ECa: Describe self using several basic characteristics.

   This writing exercise came from Simply Second Grade, via Pinterest. I
   knew that this activity was going to prove more difficult for my
   three-year-olds, which is why I had my adult volunteer stationed here
   to either spell words out loud for them or to write down what they
   dictated. All of the kids were able to at least write their names,
   hooray! I used a coloring page that I was able to find online.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Dino Wash for Dini Dinosaur
   12.C.ECb: Experiment with changes in matter when combined with other
   substances.

   The station that could have ended all stations. The kids were so
   excited with this station and I loved the science component. Before
   class, I made a sloppy mixture of flour and brown tempera paint to make
   the mud. I did not use a recipe and added more flour to the paint to
   make it more consistent. I tossed some dinosaurs in the muddy bin and
   put water in the cleaning bin. Ta-da — they were cleaning Dini
   Dinosaur. Seriously, I could have just had this station and they would
   have been happy as clams.
     __________________________________________________________________

Wrap-Up

   This was a perfect spring Bookgarteners. All the kids really loved the
   two very messy stations (painting and dino washing) and my older
   friends really spent time working on their “All About Me” papers. The
   dancing station was hard to integrate as a station and I’m not sure
   that I’ll repeat it like that or if I would just do a dance before
   stations.

Bookgarteners: Donald Crews

   For an overview of the Bookgarteners program, please visit this post.

   Donald Crews was a natural pick for the Bookgarteners program. His
   books are beloved by children, and he also has a huge fanbase with all
   of the fabulous vehicle books at our library.

Group Program

   To begin our program, I explained what an author was and what an
   illustrator was. I talked about how each book has one of each.
   Sometimes they are the same person and sometimes they are not. Donald
   Crews had written and illustrated all of the books I had with me today,
   but I knew that he had worked as only an illustrator on a few books so
   I mentioned that to the kids. Then, we watched a YouTube video from the
   Association of Library Service to Children that Crews recorded about
   his influences.

   Afterwards, it was time to read Freight Train together.

   Sequencing Color Bracelets with Freight Train
   2.B.ECb: With teacher assistance, retell familiar stories with three or
   more key events.

   This is a weird source of inspiration, but nonetheless…I will forever
   remember a church story/lesson because it was told with a beaded
   bracelet. I thought that the kids would benefit from making a pipe
   cleaner beaded bracelet to “tell” the story of Freight Train. This did
   require a bit of prep work on my part. I sorted beads into ziploc bags
   to make the distribution of the activity easier. You could also set up
   a line with small buckets with each of the colored beads.
     __________________________________________________________________

Activity Stations

   Four activity stations were spread out around the room. I had one teen
   volunteer in the room with me to help control the flow of kiddos.

   Sensory Transportation Scene for all books
   19.A.ECd: Use eye-hand coordination to perform tasks.

   This sensory transportation scene came from Lalymom, via Pinterest. I
   bought foam stickers from Oriental Trading and used clear contact paper
   with the sticky side out towards the kids. And if you’re wondering what
   it looked like at the end of the class, I give you this:
     __________________________________________________________________

   Shape Train Matching with Freight Train
   7.A.ECa: Compare, order, and describe objects according to a single
   attribute.

   This shape matching activity came from Toddler Approved, via Pinterest.
   I made two trains so that more kids could use this station at the same
   time. I also did not create an outline of the shape and opted instead
   for the word since I was aiming for preschoolers as opposed to
   toddlers. The kids LOVED this section and I had some families who asked
   if they could take this one home.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Counting Dots with Ten Black Dots
   6.A.ECd: Connect numbers to quantities they represent using physical
   models and informal representatives.

   This math activity came from Munchkins and Moms, via Pinterest. I
   invested in some foam puzzles from the dollar store and splurged for
   the black gems online. I absolutely plan to reuse both of these items
   in future Bookgartener programs. This was the most self-directed
   station and I think it gave the kids great confidence to be able to do
   it “all by themselves”. (The two art stations were also self-directed,
   but needed supervision from me and my volunteer.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   Wheel Stamping for all books
   25.A.ECd: Visual Arts. Investigate and participate in activities using
   visual arts materials.

   This art station came from Pre-K Pages, via Pinterest. I didn’t need to
   buy anything for this station as both ink and vehicle cars were
   something that the library already owned. This was a FRENZIED station,
   as exhibited by the only picture I managed to get during the program:
     __________________________________________________________________

Wrap-Up

   I loved every minute of this program and the activities that I had
   curated and chosen. I think this would be better suited for a fall
   session though, as my older kids breezed through a lot of activities.
   Luckily, they all wanted to go back and go the activities again, so I
   was safe!

Shake, Shimmy, & Dance: 11/17

   shakeshimmyanddance

The Plan

   Book
   Music Class Today! by David Weinstone
   I know that I’ve used this book before and will continue to use it
   again. It depicts so many of the things that kids will see in our Music
   & Movement programs, it’s a great primer for them before we start. I
   also think it’s important to reinforce that kids may not join in right
   away and that’s okay too!

   Props
   Scarves!

   El Train — Laura Doherty
   Pop Goes the Weasel — Caspar Babypants
   Dance Floor Super Hero — The Fresh Beat Band
   Shake Hands With Friends — Ella Jenkins

How It Went

   I kicked today off with a cover of a Beatles song, by Caspar Babypants:
   Hello, Goodbye. Some of the best reactions came not from caregivers
   (who did really appreciate it!), but from co-workers who heard it
   passing by the door or through the vent system. They had a great time
   with it!

   Move Like an Animal was fun and initiated a great game of pretend with
   all of the kiddos. And another version of If You’re Happy and You Know
   It drew in the caregivers around the room. We kept that interaction
   going by jumping on the El Train and traveling around the room.

   For our scarves, we practiced tossing them into the air when Caspar
   Babypants said “POP” during Pop Goes the Weasel and then they became
   superhero capes with Dance Floor Super Hero. A fabulous program with
   lots of fun had by all.

Shake, Shimmy, & Dance: 10/20

   shakeshimmyanddance

The Plan

   Book
   From Head to Toe by Eric Carle
   This is the book that basically inspired the whole interactive book
   portion before the group begins to dance along to the music. Body
   identification, movement, animals, Carle’s illustrations, large
   trim-size…what more could you ask for?

   Props
   Wrist Ribbons!

   Spin Again — Jim Gill
   Rocketship Run — Laurie Berkner
   A, B, C, D, E — Justin Roberts
   Falling — Joanie Leeds
   Shake Hands With Friends — Ella Jenkins

How It Went

   My first four songs set an energetic mood for the rest of the program.
   Wake Up, Shake Up has a great beat to it and I asked the kiddos to
   shake up their bodies as we started our dancing. This led to lots of
   interesting hair as they all shook their heads at some point. I
   followed this up with another free dance, Dance Like There’s Music In
   Your Pants, and I actually think that was poor planning on my part.
   They needed some instruction before free dance again.

   Luckily, both Spin Again and Rocketship Run have excellent instructions
   in the lyrics and we were able to follow along for the next two songs.

   For the wrist ribbons today, I wanted the kids to use them to draw
   letters or shapes in the air during A, B, C, D, E. And I got to include
   some great caregiver tips about letter and shape identification being a
   precursor to reading. And then we practiced taking our ribbons off our
   wrists and letting them fall to the ground with the seasonally
   appropriate Falling. (At least, it was perfect for Chicago in October.)

   Definitely a bumble this edition, but that’s 100% on me. See? You can
   still make mistakes even after a ton of storytimes!

   of each item, regardless of whether or not we got it on sale/discount.
   The activity sheets amount was calculated by cost of binder clip +
   lamination sheets.

   Itemized List
     * Can You Say Peace? by Karen Katz ($7.99) — Baker & Taylor

     * Activity Sheets ($2.55) — created in-house

   Total: $178.81

   Choosing books for this Bundle was a delight. The Global Babies series
   is one of my favorite all-time board books. While we own all of them at
   the library, I went with the original offering for this Bundle. I
   wanted to include a book that used language and Can You Say Peace? did
   so in a global setting. And Same, Same But Different is a great title
   that needs more recognition for sure.

   The Barefoot Books “Children of the World” memory game focuses on the
   word hello in many languages, hooray!

   Constructive Playthings Magnetic Global Children is a way for children
   to match different items with the children. The pieces are also
   swappable, so kids can blend the children to make a multicultural
   child. And the Constructive Playthings World Buildings are a great way
   to pack the world into a Bundle. (Though I do wish it was a bit less
   Europe-centric.)

Shake, Shimmy, & Dance: 9/22

   shakeshimmyanddance

The Plan

   Book
   A Hop is Up by Kristy Dempsey
   This rhyming picture book is one that I used a while ago and was so
   happy to bring back to the Shake, Shimmy programming. I love the urban
   setting, the diversity of the characters, and the great opportunities
   for interaction with the kids. I just recently added this to our
   books-you-can’t-miss-section and all of those copies are checked out!

   Props
   Wrist Ribbons!

   The Playlist

   Hello & How Are You? — Old Town School of Folk Music
   Get Your Move On — Mr. Jon & Friends
   Subway — Bari Koral Family Rock Band
   Friends Give Friends a Hand — Fresh Beat Band
   The Countdown — Jim Gill
   Paint the Day Away — Imagination Movers
   My Butterfly — Joanie Leeds
   Shake Hands With Friends — Ella Jenkins

How It Went

   I spend a lot of time thinking about the best opening songs and ways to
   capture my group’s attention from the get-go and Get Your Move On is a
   great suggestion to do so. I love the countdown aspect and the free
   dance. That lets the littles (who are almost always raring to go)
   immediately show off their best dance moves.

   Subway was a fun way to introduce a new vocabulary words and let us
   form a train around the room, ensuring that ALL the grown-ups were up
   and moving. I highly recommend doing such an activity if you need to
   get the grown-ups to buy-in. Friends Give Friends a Hand was a great
   way to promote social-emotional development at this month’s event. I
   also love to talk about consent here — some friends love to give high
   fives, but some friends prefer waving so ask before you say hello! And
   then I get to model it around the room. SO GOOD.

   Jim Gill’s newest CD has some great material on it, but my favorite
   might be The Countdown. I love practice waiting in an easy, friendly
   environment. And reminding caregivers that they can use these kinds of
   songs to practice while out and about in the world too.

   Our wrist ribbons today became two different kinds of imaginative play:
   paintbrushes and butterfly wings. I like to see the different kinds of
   movement the kids use and how it changes from one song to another.

   (For an example of the Powerpoint and handouts that I made for each
   Shake, Shimmy please visit the original post.)
