   Come discover our exciting and vibrant campus and find out why life at
                     SMU is invigorating and fulfilling.

   "The real significance of SMU at the broader level is that we were
   actually the change catalyst for completely changing the university
   situation everywhere else in Singapore."

MR HO KWON PING, CHAIRMAN, BOARD OF TRUSTEES

   "Our pedagogy is recognised to be different. Our graduates are
   perceived to be distinctive. This provides variety and diversity within
   the Singapore portfolio of higher education institutions."

PROFESSOR LILY KONG, PRESIDENT OF SMU

   "I benefited so much beyond what a price tag can label monetarily -
   from the deep knowledge and experience of faculty members and fellow
   course mates, and the lifelong friendships forged through the EMBA
   shared journey."

LAWRENCE TEH, SMU EMBA 2017 GRADUATE

   SMU was chosen because it was “able to create the right bridge between
   classroom insights and workplace application".

ANGELO PINTO, REGIONAL HEAD OF LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT, HEAD OF PARIBAS
ASIA-PACIFIC CAMPUS

   "I chose SMU because I felt that it was the university that appealed
   most to me in terms of its culture, beliefs and curriculum. I knew I
   would fit well in SMU and that I would love it here."

ASNAWI JUFRIE, SMU LEE KONG CHIAN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS ALUMNUS (2018)

   "The discussion during classes would broaden your scope but they take
   you out of your comfort zone - giving you both a very rich and intense
   experience. You are always confronted with a wide number of viewpoints
   and approaches."

CORNELIUS THIEME, SMU MBA (PART-TIME) 2016 GRADUATE

   "SMU is more international, it gives a competitive approach to the
   thought process – it’s about new thinking and new ideas. SMU fits my
   son’s character better."
