   WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials didn’t seize thousands of pounds of
   imported rat meat prior to the Super Bowl and they never issued a
   warning saying restaurants and food stores could be selling it as
   chicken wings, despite reports shared widely on multiple websites.

   The stories posted last month claim federal customs officials at the
   Port of San Francisco seized several thousands of pounds of rat meat
   imported from China. They also mention an FDA warning that some 300,000
   pounds of rat meat could still be in circulation as Super Bowl parties
   approached.

   FDA spokesman Peter Cassell told The Associated Press that the agency
   “is not aware of the seizure of rat meat referenced” and the FDA never
   issued such a warning. The stories quote two agency officials, but the
   FDA has no record of any current or past employees with those names,
   Cassell said.

   The account appears to have originated on World News Daily Report, a
   website that creates fictional news. Versions of the account were
   shared on other sites, including Urban Image Magazine.

   NEW YORK — Sports Illustrated’s new manager said Thursday that the
   65-year-old sports magazine is cutting more than 40 jobs out of a staff
   of 150.

   Maven, the company now managing the magazine, will add 200 contractors
   to cover college and professional sports teams, said Maven spokesman
   Greg Witter. These people are “independent publishers, contractors” but
   “still professional journalists,” he said.

   Maven struck a licensing deal in June to operate Sports Illustrated
   with the magazine’s new owner, branding company Authentic Brands Group.
   Magazine publisher Meredith, which earlier this year sold Sports
   Illustrated to Authentic Brands for $110 million, was initially
   supposed to run the magazine’s print edition and website.

   Sports Illustrated’s new CEO, Ross Levinsohn, is the former publisher
   of the Los Angeles Times and a controversial figure who was
   investigated on sexual harassment allegations. He was cleared of
   wrongdoing by the company, then called Tronc, that had owned the paper.
   He is a frequent collaborator with Maven’s CEO, Jim Heckman, a media
   entrepreneur.

   Heckman said in a brief June interview with The Associated Press
   that Sports Illustrated is “an important treasure for the country.
   We’re going to invest into that treasure.” He said the primary focus
   was investment in technology for the brand.

   But media watchers have been concerned about the future of the magazine
   under Authentic Brands and Maven.

   Several Sports Illustrated staffers tweeted a petition Thursday asking
   Meredith and Authentic Brands to drop Maven and save the magazine.

   Maven said the meeting where layoffs were announced Thursday “was all
   Meredith.”

   Meredith, however, said Maven made the personnel decisions that
   Meredith communicated to staffers. “Going forward, the remaining SI
   employees will work at the direction and at the pleasure of Maven,”
   Meredith said in a statement.

   Authentic Brands did not reply to questions.

   Sports Illustrated began publishing in 1954 and is known for its
   in-depth coverage of sports as well as its an annual swimsuit edition.
   It has struggled, however, with declining circulation, the emergence of
   digital rivals and the exodus of advertising dollars to online outlets.

   WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials didn’t seize thousands of pounds of
   imported rat meat prior to the Super Bowl and they never issued a
   warning saying restaurants and food stores could be selling it as
   chicken wings, despite reports shared widely on multiple websites.

   The stories posted last month claim federal customs officials at the
   Port of San Francisco seized several thousands of pounds of rat meat
   imported from China. They also mention an FDA warning that some 300,000
   pounds of rat meat could still be in circulation as Super Bowl parties
   approached.

   FDA spokesman Peter Cassell told The Associated Press that the agency
   “is not aware of the seizure of rat meat referenced” and the FDA never
   issued such a warning. The stories quote two agency officials, but the
   FDA has no record of any current or past employees with those names,
   Cassell said.

   The account appears to have originated on World News Daily Report, a
   website that creates fictional news. Versions of the account were
   shared on other sites, including Urban Image Magazine.

   NEW YORK — Sports Illustrated’s new manager said Thursday that the
   65-year-old sports magazine is cutting more than 40 jobs out of a staff
   of 150.

   Maven, the company now managing the magazine, will add 200 contractors
   to cover college and professional sports teams, said Maven spokesman
   Greg Witter. These people are “independent publishers, contractors” but
   “still professional journalists,” he said.

   Maven struck a licensing deal in June to operate Sports Illustrated
   with the magazine’s new owner, branding company Authentic Brands Group.
   Magazine publisher Meredith, which earlier this year sold Sports
   Illustrated to Authentic Brands for $110 million, was initially
   supposed to run the magazine’s print edition and website.

   Sports Illustrated’s new CEO, Ross Levinsohn, is the former publisher
   of the Los Angeles Times and a controversial figure who was
   investigated on sexual harassment allegations. He was cleared of
   wrongdoing by the company, then called Tronc, that had owned the paper.
   He is a frequent collaborator with Maven’s CEO, Jim Heckman, a media
   entrepreneur.

   Heckman said in a brief June interview with The Associated Press
   that Sports Illustrated is “an important treasure for the country.
   We’re going to invest into that treasure.” He said the primary focus
   was investment in technology for the brand.

   But media watchers have been concerned about the future of the magazine
   under Authentic Brands and Maven.

   Several Sports Illustrated staffers tweeted a petition Thursday asking
   Meredith and Authentic Brands to drop Maven and save the magazine.

   Maven said the meeting where layoffs were announced Thursday “was all
   Meredith.”

   Meredith, however, said Maven made the personnel decisions that
   Meredith communicated to staffers. “Going forward, the remaining SI
   employees will work at the direction and at the pleasure of Maven,”
   Meredith said in a statement.

   Authentic Brands did not reply to questions.

   Sports Illustrated began publishing in 1954 and is known for its
   in-depth coverage of sports as well as its an annual swimsuit edition.
   It has struggled, however, with declining circulation, the emergence of
   digital rivals and the exodus of advertising dollars to online outlets.

Sports Illustrated, under new management, cuts staff jobs

     * Tali Arbel
     * October 3, 2019 at 7:29 pm
     * Categories: Latest News, Sports

   In this Saturday, Feb. 27, 2016 file photo, Mo'ne Davis, 14, of
   Philadelphia, signs an autograph for a fan on the cover of Sports
   Illustrated magazine at PNC Field in Moosic, Pa.

   NEW YORK — Sports Illustrated’s new manager said Thursday that the
   65-year-old sports magazine is cutting more than 40 jobs out of a staff
   of 150.

   Maven, the company now managing the magazine, will add 200 contractors
   to cover college and professional sports teams, said Maven spokesman
   Greg Witter. These people are “independent publishers, contractors” but
   “still professional journalists,” he said.

   Maven struck a licensing deal in June to operate Sports Illustrated
   with the magazine’s new owner, branding company Authentic Brands Group.
   Magazine publisher Meredith, which earlier this year sold Sports
   Illustrated to Authentic Brands for $110 million, was initially
   supposed to run the magazine’s print edition and website.

   Sports Illustrated’s new CEO, Ross Levinsohn, is the former publisher
   of the Los Angeles Times and a controversial figure who was
   investigated on sexual harassment allegations. He was cleared of
   wrongdoing by the company, then called Tronc, that had owned the paper.
   He is a frequent collaborator with Maven’s CEO, Jim Heckman, a media
   entrepreneur.

   Heckman said in a brief June interview with The Associated Press
   that Sports Illustrated is “an important treasure for the country.
   We’re going to invest into that treasure.” He said the primary focus
   was investment in technology for the brand.

   But media watchers have been concerned about the future of the magazine
   under Authentic Brands and Maven.

   Several Sports Illustrated staffers tweeted a petition Thursday asking
   Meredith and Authentic Brands to drop Maven and save the magazine.

   Maven said the meeting where layoffs were announced Thursday “was all
   Meredith.”

   Meredith, however, said Maven made the personnel decisions that
   Meredith communicated to staffers. “Going forward, the remaining SI
   employees will work at the direction and at the pleasure of Maven,”
   Meredith said in a statement.

   Authentic Brands did not reply to questions.

   Sports Illustrated began publishing in 1954 and is known for its
   in-depth coverage of sports as well as its an annual swimsuit edition.
   It has struggled, however, with declining circulation, the emergence of
   digital rivals and the exodus of advertising dollars to online outlets.
