Nine Things to Know About Trump Impeachment Controversy

   rotunda, on Capitol Hill, in Washington, April 18, 2019.

   WASHINGTON - House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday announced a “formal
   impeachment inquiry” into President Donald Trump, escalating a
   long-running clash between Democratic lawmakers and the White House
   over alleged presidential malfeasance. The announcement followed
   disclosures that Trump in a July 25 call to Ukraine’s president asked
   him to investigate front-running Democratic candidate Joe Biden and his
   son, Hunter.

   Here are nine things you need to know about the festering impeachment
   controversy.

   What is impeachment?

   This refers to the constitutional process of removing a sitting
   president from office. The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power
   to oust a president for “treason, bribery or other high crimes and
   misdemeanors.” While there is no single definition of the phrase “high
   crimes and misdemeanors,” it is generally understood to include actions
   that violate the oath of office and the public trust. The impeachment
   process begins with formal charges brought in the House of
   Representatives and ends with a trial in the Senate where two-thirds of
   senators must vote to convict the president.

   This would be the fourth congressional impeachment attempt in history.
   Former presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were impeached and
   brought to trial in the Senate, but subsequently won acquittal. Former
   President Richard M. Nixon resigned before being impeached in the
   House.

   What happened on Tuesday?

   To be clear, what Pelosi did is at least several steps from formal
   action against Trump. By ordering a formal impeachment inquiry, Pelosi
   brought a half dozen House investigations of Trump under a new rubric.
   She instructed the chairmen of six House committees — Intelligence,
   Judiciary, Government Oversight, Foreign Affairs, Ways and Means and
   Financial Services — to speed up their investigations to determine
   whether to impeach Trump.

   Washington, Sept. 24, 2019.

   Why Did Pelosi decide to act now?

   For months, Pelosi resisted calls from many liberal members of her
   party to impeach the president. The tipping point came when details of
   Trump’s call to the Ukrainian leader and a whistleblower complaint by
   an anonymous intelligence official leaked this month. Then, a group of
   eight moderate Democrats who had previously opposed impeachment wrote a
   column this week saying they now favored impeachment.

   How will this impact the ongoing investigations?

   The administration so far refused to cooperate with the six
   investigating panels, declining subpoenas to produce documents and
   witnesses.  With the launch of the impeachment inquiry, the courts are
   more likely to rule in favor of congressional subpoenas, according to
   Susan Low Bloch, a constitutional scholar at Georgetown University.

   What are articles of impeachment, and how can the House bring them up
   against a president?

   Articles of Impeachment are formal charges against a president brought
   in the House of Representatives.  A simple majority vote is needed to
   pass an article of impeachment. In the Bill Clinton impeachment case in
   1998, the House considered four articles of impeachment but ultimately
   approved two, charging him with lying to a grand jury and obstruction
   of justice.

   How close are we to a House Judiciary vote and action by the full
   House?

   With the administration trying to stall the investigations, the
   impeachment inquiry is likely to drag on for months. Even if lower
   courts rule in favor of the House, the White House could take the
   matter all the way to the Supreme Court where Republican-appointed
   justices hold sway.  Impeachment is not a given, said Norman Ornstein,
   a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
   “What we have is a process trying to delay this as long as possible.”
   Bottom line: Don’t expect a House impeachment vote any time soon.

   Garden of the White House in Washington, June 14, 2019.

   What is the Senate trial process?

   Once the House passes one or more articles of impeachment, the process
   shifts to the Senate where a trial is conducted. The proceeding is
   presided over by the chief justice of the United States. House
   Judiciary Committee members serve as prosecutors, while the president
   is represented by his defense lawyers. It takes two-thirds of senators
   to convict the president on any one count. Republicans currently hold a
   53 to 47 seat majority in the Senate.  If the president were found
   guilty, he would be expelled from office and replaced by the vice
   president.

   What’s the point of impeaching the president if the
   Republican-controlled Senate won’t convict a Republican president?

   It’s a question that’s often asked, and one that was shouted at Pelosi
   Tuesday after she announced the impeachment inquiry. For many
   Democrats, it comes down to principle, having sworn to uphold the
   Constitution and safeguard the republic, said Melanie Sloan, a senior
   adviser at American Oversight, a nonpartisan ethics watchdog.

   What about the risks to the Democrats of a political blowback?

   With just 6% of Republican voters in favor of impeachment and most
   Republican senators in the president’s corner, the prospect of a failed
   impeachment could backfire against the Democrats, allowing Trump to
   claim vindication and boosting his 2020 re-election prospects. Clinton
   survived impeachment in 1998, and he saw his party surge to victory in
   the following midterm elections.

   Impeachment Push Complicates Trump's Re-Election Prospects
   The decision by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to launch an

   opinion polls suggest Trump is in a weaker position for re-election
   than most other incumbent president have been, and he is counting on a
   strong economy and loyal supporters to overcome what is expected to be
   an intense turnout of motivated Democratic voters next year.

What happens when POTUS calls a foreign leader?

President Donald Trump’s July 25 phone conversation with President Volodymyr
Zelensky of Ukraine has roiled Washington. VOA has spoken with several former
senior NSC officials to understand how the White House conducts these calls.

By William Gallo | VOA News

THE PREPARATION

   Ahead of the phone call, National Security Council staff prepare a
   briefing, including talking points, for the president.

   A regional or country-specific NSC department prepares the briefing.

   Other relevant NSC department heads review it.

   The National Security Advisor approves the briefing.

   Typically, the night before the call, the president studies the
   briefing and directs any questions to the National Security Advisor.

The call

   Most presidential calls take place in the Oval Office. They include
   just a handful of people, including the National Security Advisor and
   one or two other senior NSC directors or presidential advisers.

The Situation Room

   Downstairs in the White House, in the Situation Room, two NSC staffers
   transcribe the phone call.

   If the foreign leader doesn’t speak English, an interpreter is also
   present.

   When the call is finished, a senior director in the Situation Room
   reviews the notes and transcript.

“These aren’t taped. … I was a note-taker on a couple calls. It’s frantic.
You’re typing so fast, you just get what you can.”

The distribution

   A senior NSC director then determines which senior White House staff
   and Cabinet members should be able to access the info.

   Those agency heads will distribute it within their organizations as
   needed.

How many people will see the transcripts?

   Inside the White House, only 10-20 people would have access to the
   transcript. If senior leaders at other agencies are included, the
   number can climb to as high as 50 or more.

   This refers to the constitutional process of removing a sitting
   president from office. The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power
   to oust a president for “treason, bribery or other high crimes and
   misdemeanors.” While there is no single definition of the phrase “high
   crimes and misdemeanors,” it is generally understood to include actions
   that violate the oath of office and the public trust. The impeachment
   process begins with formal charges brought in the House of
   Representatives and ends with a trial in the Senate where two-thirds of
   senators must vote to convict the president.

   This would be the fourth congressional impeachment attempt in history.
   Former presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were impeached and
   brought to trial in the Senate, but subsequently won acquittal. Former
   President Richard M. Nixon resigned before being impeached in the
   House.

   What happened on Tuesday?

   To be clear, what Pelosi did is at least several steps from formal
   action against Trump. By ordering a formal impeachment inquiry, Pelosi
   brought a half dozen House investigations of Trump under a new rubric.
   She instructed the chairmen of six House committees — Intelligence,
   Judiciary, Government Oversight, Foreign Affairs, Ways and Means and
   Financial Services — to speed up their investigations to determine
   whether to impeach Trump.

   impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, on Capitol Hill in
   Washington, Sept. 24, 2019.

   Why Did Pelosi decide to act now?

   For months, Pelosi resisted calls from many liberal members of her
   party to impeach the president. The tipping point came when details of
   Trump’s call to the Ukrainian leader and a whistleblower complaint by
   an anonymous intelligence official leaked this month. Then, a group of
   eight moderate Democrats who had previously opposed impeachment wrote a
   column this week saying they now favored impeachment.

   How will this impact the ongoing investigations?

   The administration so far refused to cooperate with the six
   investigating panels, declining subpoenas to produce documents and
   witnesses.  With the launch of the impeachment inquiry, the courts are
   more likely to rule in favor of congressional subpoenas, according to
   Susan Low Bloch, a constitutional scholar at Georgetown University.

   What are articles of impeachment, and how can the House bring them up
   against a president?

   Articles of Impeachment are formal charges against a president brought
   in the House of Representatives.  A simple majority vote is needed to
   pass an article of impeachment. In the Bill Clinton impeachment case in
   1998, the House considered four articles of impeachment but ultimately
   approved two, charging him with lying to a grand jury and obstruction
   of justice.

   How close are we to a House Judiciary vote and action by the full
   House?

   With the administration trying to stall the investigations, the
   impeachment inquiry is likely to drag on for months. Even if lower
   courts rule in favor of the House, the White House could take the
   matter all the way to the Supreme Court where Republican-appointed
   justices hold sway.  Impeachment is not a given, said Norman Ornstein,
   a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
   “What we have is a process trying to delay this as long as possible.”
   Bottom line: Don’t expect a House impeachment vote any time soon.

   What is the Senate trial process?

   Once the House passes one or more articles of impeachment, the process
   shifts to the Senate where a trial is conducted. The proceeding is
   presided over by the chief justice of the United States. House
   Judiciary Committee members serve as prosecutors, while the president
   is represented by his defense lawyers. It takes two-thirds of senators
   to convict the president on any one count. Republicans currently hold a
   53 to 47 seat majority in the Senate.  If the president were found
   guilty, he would be expelled from office and replaced by the vice
   president.

   What’s the point of impeaching the president if the
   Republican-controlled Senate won’t convict a Republican president?

   It’s a question that’s often asked, and one that was shouted at Pelosi
   Tuesday after she announced the impeachment inquiry. For many
   Democrats, it comes down to principle, having sworn to uphold the
   Constitution and safeguard the republic, said Melanie Sloan, a senior
   adviser at American Oversight, a nonpartisan ethics watchdog.

   What about the risks to the Democrats of a political blowback?

   With just 6% of Republican voters in favor of impeachment and most
   Republican senators in the president’s corner, the prospect of a failed
   impeachment could backfire against the Democrats, allowing Trump to
   claim vindication and boosting his 2020 re-election prospects. Clinton
   survived impeachment in 1998, and he saw his party surge to victory in
   the following midterm elections.

   Impeachment Push Complicates Trump's Re-Election Prospects
   The decision by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to launch an
   impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump has complicated what
   already was Trump's uncertain road to re-election next year.  Public
   opinion polls suggest Trump is in a weaker position for re-election
   than most other incumbent president have been, and he is counting on a
   strong economy and loyal supporters to overcome what is expected to be
   an intense turnout of motivated Democratic voters next year.

What happens when POTUS calls a foreign leader?

President Donald Trump’s July 25 phone conversation with President Volodymyr
Zelensky of Ukraine has roiled Washington. VOA has spoken with several former
senior NSC officials to understand how the White House conducts these calls.

By William Gallo | VOA News

THE PREPARATION

   Ahead of the phone call, National Security Council staff prepare a
   briefing, including talking points, for the president.
   [leaks_circle__8.png]

   A regional or country-specific NSC department prepares the briefing.
   [leaks_circle__10.png]

   Other relevant NSC department heads review it.
   [leaks_circle__12.png]

   The National Security Advisor approves the briefing.
   [leaks_advising-the-president.png]

   Typically, the night before the call, the president studies the
   briefing and directs any questions to the National Security Advisor.

The call

   Most presidential calls take place in the Oval Office. They include
   just a handful of people, including the National Security Advisor and
   one or two other senior NSC directors or presidential advisers.

The Situation Room

   Downstairs in the White House, in the Situation Room, two NSC staffers
   transcribe the phone call.

   If the foreign leader doesn’t speak English, an interpreter is also
   present.

   When the call is finished, a senior director in the Situation Room
   reviews the notes and transcript.

“These aren’t taped. … I was a note-taker on a couple calls. It’s frantic.
You’re typing so fast, you just get what you can.”

The distribution

   A senior NSC director then determines which senior White House staff
   and Cabinet members should be able to access the info.

   Those agency heads will distribute it within their organizations as
   needed.

   [leaks_agency-2.png]
   [leaks_agency-3.png]

How many people will see the transcripts?

   Inside the White House, only 10-20 people would have access to the
   transcript. If senior leaders at other agencies are included, the
   number can climb to as high as 50 or more.

   A version of this graphic was originally published in September 2017.
