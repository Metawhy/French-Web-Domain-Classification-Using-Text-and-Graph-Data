   Below is a PHP example using curl how to create a new paste:
   $api_dev_key = 'YOUR API DEVELOPER KEY'; // your api_developer_key
   $api_paste_code = 'just some random text you :)'; // your paste text
   $api_paste_private = '1'; // 0=public 1=unlisted 2=private
   $api_paste_name = 'justmyfilename.php'; // name or title of your paste
   $api_paste_expire_date = '10M'; $api_paste_format = 'php';
   $api_user_key = ''; // if an invalid or expired api_user_key is used,
   an error will spawn. If no api_user_key is used, a guest paste will be
   created $api_paste_name = urlencode($api_paste_name); $api_paste_code =
   urlencode($api_paste_code); $url =
   'https://pastebin.com/api/api_post.php'; $ch = curl_init($url);
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true); curl_setopt($ch,

   Creating A New Paste, The 'api_paste_expire_date' Paramater In Detail
   We have 9 valid values available which you can use with the
   api_paste_expire_date parameter:
       N = Never
       10M = 10 Minutes
       1H = 1 Hour
       1D = 1 Day
       1W = 1 Week
       2W = 2 Weeks
       1M = 1 Month
       6M = 6 Months
       1Y = 1 Year
   Creating A New Paste, The 'api_paste_private' Paramater In Detail
   We have 3 valid values available which you can use with the
   api_paste_private parameter:
       0 = Public
       1 = Unlisted
       2 = Private (only allowed in combination with api_user_key, as you
   have to be logged into your account to access the paste)
   Creating An 'api_user_key' Using The API Member Login System
   With this API we allow you to create applications which use the
   Pastebin members system. Sending a valid POST request to our API login
   system will return a unique api_user_key which can then be used to
   create a paste as a logged in user. Please send the request to the link
   shown below:
   https://pastebin.com/api/api_login.php
   Include all the following POST parameters when you request the url:
   1. api_dev_key - this is your API Developer Key, in your case: YOUR API
   DEVELOPER KEY
   2. api_user_name - this is the username of the user you want to login.
   3. api_user_password - this is the password of the user you want to
   login.
   If all 3 values match, a valid user session key will be returned. This
   key can be used as the api_user_key paramater. Only one key can be
   active at the same time for the same user. This key does not expire,
   unless a new one is generated. We recommend creating just one, then
   caching that key locally as it does not expire.
   Below is a PHP example using curl how to create a valid api_user_key:
   $api_dev_key = 'YOUR API DEVELOPER KEY'; $api_user_name =
   'a_users_username'; $api_user_password = 'a_users_password';
   $api_user_name = urlencode($api_user_name); $api_user_password =
   urlencode($api_user_password); $url =
   'https://pastebin.com/api/api_login.php'; $ch = curl_init($url);
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true); curl_setopt($ch,
   CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS,
   'api_dev_key='.$api_dev_key.'&api_user_name='.$api_user_name.'&api_user
   _password='.$api_user_password.''); curl_setopt($ch,
   CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_VERBOSE, 1);
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_NOBODY, 0); $response = curl_exec($ch); echo
   $response;
   Possible Good API Responses: (example)
   6c6d3fe13b19bbd6e479b705df0a607f
   Possible Bad API Responses:
   Bad API request, use POST request, not GET Bad API request, invalid
   api_dev_key Bad API request, invalid login Bad API request, account not

   What is Pastebin.com all about?
   Pastebin is a website where you can store any text online for easy
   sharing. The website is mainly used by programmers to store pieces of
   sources code or configuration information, but anyone is more than
   welcome to paste any type of text. The idea behind the site is to make
   it more convenient for people to share large amounts of text online.
   What is your Acceptable Use Policy?
   Broadly speaking, the site was created to help programmers. You are
   however welcome to post any type of text to Pastebin. Please do not
   post email lists, password lists or personal information. The "report
   abuse" feature can be used to flag such pastes and they will be
   deleted. Do not aggressively spider the site. If you do want to scrape
   our website, use our scraping API.
   Do NOT post:
   - email lists
   - login details
   - stolen source code
   - hacked data
   - copyrighted information / data
   - password lists
   - banking / creditcard / financial information / data
   - personal information / data
   - pornographic information / data
   - spam links (this includes promoting your own site)
   If you do not comply with our Acceptable Use Policy we might ban your
   account and/or IP address from the website. More information can be
   found in our Terms of Service.
   How can I contact Pastebin?
   Check out our contact page.
   What is MY PASTEBIN?
   When you create an account you get your own Pastebin. This means you
   can now store pastes and have full control over them at any point in
   the future. Having your own Pastebin is also great for sharing your
   pastes with others. Your Pastebin is both public and private at the
   same time. Your public pastes are visible to everybody while the
   private ones are only visible to you.
   How do folders work?
   Folders are only available to PRO users. When you create a new paste,
   simply select the folder where you want the past to be posted in. If
   you click the + symbol, you can also create a new folder, and the paste
   will then be placed into that folder. When editing a paste you can
   move/remove a paste from a folder.
   Who can see my folders?
   If a user creates a folder, and puts 'public' pastes in that folder, to
   others, those pastes will show up in the root folder of that Pastebin
   account. However, for the logged in user who created the folder, those
   pastes will show in the folder they were put in.
   Note: Folders are meant to organize your own private Pastebin better
   and are only visible to the logged in user who created them.
   How many pastes can I create?
   The short answer is: as many as you like.
   There are however some limitations to fight off spammers.
   Guests can create up to 10 new pastes per 24 hours.
   Free members can create up to 20 new pastes per 24 hours.
   PRO members can create up to 250 new pastes per 24 hours.
   Further limits are:
   Guest can create unlimited 'public' pastes, unlimited 'unlisted'
   pastes, but can't create 'private' pastes.
   Free members can create unlimited 'public' pastes, 10 'unlisted'
   pastes, 2 'private' paste.
   PRO members can create unlimited 'public' pastes, unlimited 'unlisted'
   pastes, unlimited 'private' pastes.
   But I see some people post way more than those limits, how is that
   possible?
   Some users have special permissions to their accounts. If you want to
   post more than 250 pastes per day, please contact us.
   How does your Spam Filter work?
   Pastebin uses an automated spam protection system that will sometimes
   display a captcha request after you have tried to create a new paste.
   When you get a captcha request, you have 10 minutes to enter a valid
   response. If you don't validate your paste within 10 minutes, we will
   automatically remove it.
   Various things can trigger this captcha spam protection.
   A few examples are:
   - trying to create a certain amount of new pastes in a short period of
   time. (flooding)
   - trying to create pastes with links in it.
   - trying to create duplicate pastes.
   - trying to create pastes with 'suspicious' keywords in it.
   There are various levels of spam protection. Anonymous guests, free
   members and PRO members all have different spam detection levels. Being
   a PRO member will allow you to post "almost" anything without the
   automatic spam protection being activated.
   Is there an API?
   Yes, we have got an API available.
   Who can see my pastes?
   If you create a public paste (public by default), your paste will show
   up for everybody in the menu on the right and on the archive pages. You
   can also create unlisted pastes, these items will be invisible for
   others unless you share your paste link. If you are a member of
   Pastebin you can also create private pastes. These items can only be
   viewed by you when you are logged in and are therefore password
   protected. Search engines will only index public pastes.
   How can I get content removed?
   You are only able to remove items that you created while you were
   logged in. If you pasted something as a guest, there is no quick delete
   option. You can however use the 'REPORT ABUSE' button above each paste,
   and explain why the item has to be removed. We try to handle all
   removal requests within 24 hours. You can also email us.
   For DMCA removal requests please click here.
   How does your hits counter work?
   The hits shown above each paste displays the number of unique visitors.
   We only count a visitor once per certain amount of time, and we try to
   filter out bot & scraper traffic from the hits counter. We also do not
   include hits which came from the RAW version of pastes, so only the
   hits that happened on our actual website.
   What is the maximum paste size?
   The maximum size a paste can be is 512 kilobytes (0.5 megabytes). This
   is should be enough for almost any script, and it prevents people from
   jamming our servers. PRO members are allowed to create pastes up to 10
   megabytes.

   All archives are listed here. We use the Geshi software for our
   highlighting. Please contact us if you want to suggest a new language.
   How do I highlight certain lines in a paste?
   There are two ways of doing this. While creating a new paste, you can
   select the lines that you want to highlight, and while those lines are
   selected you can click the small 'pen' icon at the top right of the
   textarea. This will add the code '@h@' before each selected line. When
   you submit the paste, those codes will change into yellow highlighted
   lines. You can also manually add the code '@h@' infront of each line
   that you want to highlight.
   Can I advertise my product/brand on Pastebin?
   Absolutely! Contact us directly.
   Can I change my username?
   Absolutely! But this is only available for PRO users. What about
   getting a username that is already taken? This is also possible, but
   only if the user in question has become inactive. This means, if a user
   has no pastes in his-her account, and hasn't logged in for over 6
   months. On the username changer page you can check username
   availability.
   How do I downgrade my PRO account?
   Simply go to the billing page in your profile.
   I got blocked! Can I scrape your website?
   Yes, but we do limit the amount of requests that people can make, so it
   is very possible that you get blocked from time to time. If you want to
   scrape our platform more intensely, we have a custom scraper API
   available where we can whitelist your IP, so you don't get blocked
   anymore. This feature is only available for LIFETIME PRO users. To
   learn more, visit our scraping page.
   Where is Pastebin hosted?
   Pastebin is hosted by the good people over at Steadfast.
   Do my pastes stay online forever?
   That depends on you. You decide if you want your pastes to "expire".
   Setting an expiration date will automatically remove the paste after a
   certain amount of time. Also, as a member you can always delete your
   pastes whenever you like.
   At this moment in time we do not delete pastes that do not have an
   expiration date. But in the future we might automatically delete pastes
   that have not been viewed by anyone in more than 6 months. Again, this
   is not something we are doing at this moment. But we might start doing
   it in the future. PRO users will never have their posts automatically
   removed due to inactivity.
   Can I post links & images?
   We allow clickable links & images to be posted, but only by our PRO
   users. Reason is, to prevent abuse of this functionality. Via the
   Markdown language you can post images, links, make text big/small,
   include tables and much much more.
   How do I delete my account?
   You can delete your Pastebin account at any time. Simply go to this
   page. You will be asked to log into your account (if you aren't already
   logged in).

   Creating A New Paste
   Creating a new paste via our API is very easy. You simply have to send
   a valid POST request to the url shown below. Please make sure you are
   sending the data
   as the UTF-8 charset.
   https://pastebin.com/api/api_post.php
   Below is a PHP example using curl how to create a new paste:
   $api_dev_key = 'YOUR API DEVELOPER KEY'; // your api_developer_key
   $api_paste_code = 'just some random text you :)'; // your paste text
   $api_paste_private = '1'; // 0=public 1=unlisted 2=private
   $api_paste_name = 'justmyfilename.php'; // name or title of your paste
   $api_paste_expire_date = '10M'; $api_paste_format = 'php';
   $api_user_key = ''; // if an invalid or expired api_user_key is used,
   an error will spawn. If no api_user_key is used, a guest paste will be
   created $api_paste_name = urlencode($api_paste_name); $api_paste_code =
   urlencode($api_paste_code); $url =
   'https://pastebin.com/api/api_post.php'; $ch = curl_init($url);
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true); curl_setopt($ch,
   CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS,
   'api_option=paste&api_user_key='.$api_user_key.'&api_paste_private='.$a
   pi_paste_private.'&api_paste_name='.$api_paste_name.'&api_paste_expire_
   date='.$api_paste_expire_date.'&api_paste_format='.$api_paste_format.'&
   api_dev_key='.$api_dev_key.'&api_paste_code='.$api_paste_code.'');
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); curl_setopt($ch,
   CURLOPT_VERBOSE, 1); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_NOBODY, 0); $response =
   curl_exec($ch); echo $response;

   Creating A New Paste, The 'api_paste_expire_date' Paramater In Detail
   We have 9 valid values available which you can use with the
   api_paste_expire_date parameter:
       N = Never
       10M = 10 Minutes
       1H = 1 Hour
       1D = 1 Day
       1W = 1 Week
       2W = 2 Weeks
       1M = 1 Month
       6M = 6 Months
       1Y = 1 Year
   Creating A New Paste, The 'api_paste_private' Paramater In Detail
   We have 3 valid values available which you can use with the
   api_paste_private parameter:
       0 = Public
       1 = Unlisted
       2 = Private (only allowed in combination with api_user_key, as you
   have to be logged into your account to access the paste)
   Creating An 'api_user_key' Using The API Member Login System
   With this API we allow you to create applications which use the
   Pastebin members system. Sending a valid POST request to our API login
   system will return a unique api_user_key which can then be used to
   create a paste as a logged in user. Please send the request to the link
   shown below:
   https://pastebin.com/api/api_login.php
   Include all the following POST parameters when you request the url:
   1. api_dev_key - this is your API Developer Key, in your case: YOUR API
   DEVELOPER KEY
   2. api_user_name - this is the username of the user you want to login.
   3. api_user_password - this is the password of the user you want to
   login.
   If all 3 values match, a valid user session key will be returned. This
   key can be used as the api_user_key paramater. Only one key can be
   active at the same time for the same user. This key does not expire,
   unless a new one is generated. We recommend creating just one, then
   caching that key locally as it does not expire.
   Below is a PHP example using curl how to create a valid api_user_key:
   $api_dev_key = 'YOUR API DEVELOPER KEY'; $api_user_name =
   'a_users_username'; $api_user_password = 'a_users_password';
   $api_user_name = urlencode($api_user_name); $api_user_password =
   urlencode($api_user_password); $url =
   'https://pastebin.com/api/api_login.php'; $ch = curl_init($url);
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true); curl_setopt($ch,
   CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS,
   'api_dev_key='.$api_dev_key.'&api_user_name='.$api_user_name.'&api_user
   _password='.$api_user_password.''); curl_setopt($ch,
   CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_VERBOSE, 1);
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_NOBODY, 0); $response = curl_exec($ch); echo
   $response;
   Possible Good API Responses: (example)
   6c6d3fe13b19bbd6e479b705df0a607f
   Possible Bad API Responses:
   Bad API request, use POST request, not GET Bad API request, invalid
   api_dev_key Bad API request, invalid login Bad API request, account not
   active Bad API request, invalid POST parameters
   If you quickly need to create a personal api_user_key, you can use this
   form to generate one.
   Listing Pastes Created By A User
   With this API you can list all the pastes created by a certain user.
   You will need send a valid POST request to the url below to access the
   data:
   https://pastebin.com/api/api_post.php
   Include all the following POST parameters when you request the url:
   1. api_dev_key - this is your API Developer Key, in your case: YOUR API
   DEVELOPER KEY
   2. api_user_key - this is the session key of the logged in user. How to
   obtain such a key
   3. api_results_limit - this is not required, by default its set to 50,
   min value is 1, max value is 1000
   4. api_option - set as 'list'
   Below is a PHP example using curl how to list pastes:
   $api_dev_key = 'YOUR API DEVELOPER KEY'; $api_user_key = '';
   $api_results_limit = '100'; $url =
   'https://pastebin.com/api/api_post.php'; $ch = curl_init($url);
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true); curl_setopt($ch,
   CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS,
   'api_option=list&api_user_key='.$api_user_key.'&api_dev_key='.$api_dev_
   key.'&api_results_limit='.$api_results_limit.''); curl_setopt($ch,
   CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_VERBOSE, 1);
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_NOBODY, 0); $response = curl_exec($ch); echo
   $response;

   Simply add the paste_key at the end of that url and you will get the
   raw output.

   What is Pastebin.com all about?
   Pastebin is a website where you can store any text online for easy
   sharing. The website is mainly used by programmers to store pieces of
   sources code or configuration information, but anyone is more than
   welcome to paste any type of text. The idea behind the site is to make
   it more convenient for people to share large amounts of text online.
   What is your Acceptable Use Policy?
   Broadly speaking, the site was created to help programmers. You are
   however welcome to post any type of text to Pastebin. Please do not
   post email lists, password lists or personal information. The "report
   abuse" feature can be used to flag such pastes and they will be
   deleted. Do not aggressively spider the site. If you do want to scrape
   our website, use our scraping API.
   Do NOT post:
   - email lists
   - login details
   - stolen source code
   - hacked data
   - copyrighted information / data
   - password lists
   - banking / creditcard / financial information / data
   - personal information / data
   - pornographic information / data
   - spam links (this includes promoting your own site)
   If you do not comply with our Acceptable Use Policy we might ban your
   account and/or IP address from the website. More information can be
   found in our Terms of Service.
   How can I contact Pastebin?
   Check out our contact page.
   What is MY PASTEBIN?
   When you create an account you get your own Pastebin. This means you
   can now store pastes and have full control over them at any point in
   the future. Having your own Pastebin is also great for sharing your
   pastes with others. Your Pastebin is both public and private at the
   same time. Your public pastes are visible to everybody while the
   private ones are only visible to you.
   How do folders work?
   Folders are only available to PRO users. When you create a new paste,
   simply select the folder where you want the past to be posted in. If
   you click the + symbol, you can also create a new folder, and the paste
   will then be placed into that folder. When editing a paste you can
   move/remove a paste from a folder.
   Who can see my folders?
   If a user creates a folder, and puts 'public' pastes in that folder, to
   others, those pastes will show up in the root folder of that Pastebin
   account. However, for the logged in user who created the folder, those
   pastes will show in the folder they were put in.
   Note: Folders are meant to organize your own private Pastebin better
   and are only visible to the logged in user who created them.
   How many pastes can I create?
   The short answer is: as many as you like.
   There are however some limitations to fight off spammers.
   Guests can create up to 10 new pastes per 24 hours.
   Free members can create up to 20 new pastes per 24 hours.
   PRO members can create up to 250 new pastes per 24 hours.
   Further limits are:
   Guest can create unlimited 'public' pastes, unlimited 'unlisted'
   pastes, but can't create 'private' pastes.
   Free members can create unlimited 'public' pastes, 10 'unlisted'
   pastes, 2 'private' paste.
   PRO members can create unlimited 'public' pastes, unlimited 'unlisted'
   pastes, unlimited 'private' pastes.
   But I see some people post way more than those limits, how is that
   possible?
   Some users have special permissions to their accounts. If you want to
   post more than 250 pastes per day, please contact us.
   How does your Spam Filter work?
   Pastebin uses an automated spam protection system that will sometimes
   display a captcha request after you have tried to create a new paste.
   When you get a captcha request, you have 10 minutes to enter a valid
   response. If you don't validate your paste within 10 minutes, we will
   automatically remove it.
   Various things can trigger this captcha spam protection.
   A few examples are:
   - trying to create a certain amount of new pastes in a short period of
   time. (flooding)
   - trying to create pastes with links in it.
   - trying to create duplicate pastes.
   - trying to create pastes with 'suspicious' keywords in it.
   There are various levels of spam protection. Anonymous guests, free
   members and PRO members all have different spam detection levels. Being
   a PRO member will allow you to post "almost" anything without the
   automatic spam protection being activated.
   Is there an API?
   Yes, we have got an API available.
   Who can see my pastes?
   If you create a public paste (public by default), your paste will show
   up for everybody in the menu on the right and on the archive pages. You
   can also create unlisted pastes, these items will be invisible for
   others unless you share your paste link. If you are a member of
   Pastebin you can also create private pastes. These items can only be
   viewed by you when you are logged in and are therefore password
   protected. Search engines will only index public pastes.
   How can I get content removed?
   You are only able to remove items that you created while you were
   logged in. If you pasted something as a guest, there is no quick delete
   option. You can however use the 'REPORT ABUSE' button above each paste,
   and explain why the item has to be removed. We try to handle all
   removal requests within 24 hours. You can also email us.
   For DMCA removal requests please click here.
   How does your hits counter work?
   The hits shown above each paste displays the number of unique visitors.
   We only count a visitor once per certain amount of time, and we try to
   filter out bot & scraper traffic from the hits counter. We also do not
   include hits which came from the RAW version of pastes, so only the
   hits that happened on our actual website.
   What is the maximum paste size?
   The maximum size a paste can be is 512 kilobytes (0.5 megabytes). This
   is should be enough for almost any script, and it prevents people from
   jamming our servers. PRO members are allowed to create pastes up to 10
   megabytes.

   All archives are listed here. We use the Geshi software for our
   highlighting. Please contact us if you want to suggest a new language.
   How do I highlight certain lines in a paste?
   There are two ways of doing this. While creating a new paste, you can
   select the lines that you want to highlight, and while those lines are
   selected you can click the small 'pen' icon at the top right of the
   textarea. This will add the code '@h@' before each selected line. When
   you submit the paste, those codes will change into yellow highlighted
   lines. You can also manually add the code '@h@' infront of each line
   that you want to highlight.
   Can I advertise my product/brand on Pastebin?
   Absolutely! Contact us directly.
   Can I change my username?
   Absolutely! But this is only available for PRO users. What about
   getting a username that is already taken? This is also possible, but
   only if the user in question has become inactive. This means, if a user
   has no pastes in his-her account, and hasn't logged in for over 6
   months. On the username changer page you can check username
   availability.
   How do I downgrade my PRO account?
   Simply go to the billing page in your profile.
   I got blocked! Can I scrape your website?
   Yes, but we do limit the amount of requests that people can make, so it
   is very possible that you get blocked from time to time. If you want to
   scrape our platform more intensely, we have a custom scraper API
   available where we can whitelist your IP, so you don't get blocked
   anymore. This feature is only available for LIFETIME PRO users. To
   learn more, visit our scraping page.
   Where is Pastebin hosted?
   Pastebin is hosted by the good people over at Steadfast.
   Do my pastes stay online forever?
   That depends on you. You decide if you want your pastes to "expire".
   Setting an expiration date will automatically remove the paste after a
   certain amount of time. Also, as a member you can always delete your
   pastes whenever you like.
   At this moment in time we do not delete pastes that do not have an
   expiration date. But in the future we might automatically delete pastes
   that have not been viewed by anyone in more than 6 months. Again, this
   is not something we are doing at this moment. But we might start doing
   it in the future. PRO users will never have their posts automatically
   removed due to inactivity.
   Can I post links & images?
   We allow clickable links & images to be posted, but only by our PRO
   users. Reason is, to prevent abuse of this functionality. Via the
   Markdown language you can post images, links, make text big/small,
   include tables and much much more.
   How do I delete my account?
   You can delete your Pastebin account at any time. Simply go to this
   page. You will be asked to log into your account (if you aren't already
   logged in).
