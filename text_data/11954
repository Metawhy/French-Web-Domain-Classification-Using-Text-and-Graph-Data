   Mobile apps account for 57 percent of all digital media usage, and

   how publishers and advertisers can take advantage.

   Some key topics covered in the report include:
     * Mobile app vs. mobile web usage and audience behavior
     * Highlights of top-ranking and fast-growing apps
     * App activity among Millennials and other valuable audience segments
     * Consumers’ attitudes and perceptions towards apps and the app
       landscape
     * Usage habits and behavioral tendencies of app users
     * Deep dives into several app categories, including retail, gaming

2016 U.S. Cross-Platform Future in Focus

   Download Whitepaper

   2015 was another transformative year in media, as TV and digital
   convergence accelerates and the longstanding consumer habits continue
   to be upended. While the media landscape is often described as growing
   increasingly ‘fragmented’, a more accurate description might be that
   it’s becoming increasingly interconnected, with consumers seamlessly
   accessing content across more screens than ever before. The lines
   between desktop, mobile, TV and film are beginning to blur as the
   various platforms are often more distinguished by differences in use
   case than by the underlying technology. As a result of this changing
   landscape, there are a new host of issues and solutions facing
   marketers and publishers, such as how to effectively advertise across
   these platforms and how consumers’ purchasing behavior is shifting over
   time.

   Consider some of the key trends shaping the cross-platform media
   landscape in 2015 and what they suggest about the future. This was the
   year that:
     * The TV landscape continued its shifting of time and space, with
       more delayed, on-demand and digital viewing of TV programming than
       ever before.
     * Digital media usage continued to grow at a fast rate, driven by
       smartphone app usage which is inching closer and closer to 50
       percent of all digital media time spent.
     * Several traditional print publishers made huge gains with their
       digital audiences by making effective use of mobile to attract new
       readers and becoming more digitally-savvy operations.
     * Digital got exceedingly close to becoming the largest advertising
       medium despite facing continued challenges such as viewability,
       invalid traffic (IVT) and the more recent issue of ad blocking.
     * Consumers significantly accelerated their use of mobile devices for
       both shopping and purchase activity.

   In this report, we will examine some of the most important sectors of
   the cross media ecosystem to show how the landscape has changed, who is
   leading the way, and what it all means for the year ahead – and beyond.
   It is an exciting time in the media industry, and we hope this
   exploration of today’s key issues helps put the Cross-Platform Future
   in Focus.

   of a job application (collectively, “Personal Information”).

   information about your use of our Website and application. This

   similar technologies to collect this information. We also use cookies
   and similar technologies for other purposes such as to ensure
   authorized access to client-specific content, and to track client
   access to such content. Cookies are pieces of data stored on a user’s
   hard drive that contain information about a user. Please note that you
   may be able to view and delete these cookies using the features of your
   browser; however, deleting cookies may prevent you from being able to
   use the full functionality of the Website.

   Our Website and application also automatically create logs regarding
   your activity on our Website. These logs may identify the features that
   you use, the actions that you take, and the information that you
   access. We generally use this information in statistical and aggregate
   formats to assess the effectiveness of our Website and application and
   to better understand your priorities and interests.

   our Website and application. We may use Google’s analytics products to
   provide these services. To learn more about how these Google products
   collect and process data and the choices Google may offer to control
   these activities, you may visit
   www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. To learn about
   interest-based advertising activities by third parties on our Website
   and application, please see the information provided below.

   Information Collected for Market Research.  This Website may set tags
   on your browser that collect data for the ScorecardResearch service, a
   service offered by Full Circle Studies, Inc. (“Full Circle Studies”)
   which is also part of the Comscore market research group. You may

   research programs by visiting here:
   http://www.scorecardresearch.com/preferences.aspx. We will continue to
   count the fact that a browser came to a site, but we will not associate
   that event with your browser. Additionally, if your mobile device
   platform offers settings to limit data collection for interest-based
   advertising, you can use these settings to opt out of participating in
   our market research programs with respect to our data collection from
   applications on that mobile device.

   Please note that this opt-out is cookie based (i.e., a cookie must be
   on your computer to tell our systems that you have opted-out). If you
   delete, block or otherwise restrict cookies, this opt-out may not be
   effective. Additionally, because different computers and different
   Internet browsers all require their own version of the opt-out cookie,
   you need to perform this opt-out process on any computer and browsers
   that you want to be opted-out.

How is the collected information used?

   We may use the Personal Information that you provide to us to operate

       the damages that we may sustain;
     * In connection with an actual or potential merger, sale,
       acquisition, assignment, or transfer of all or part of our assets,
       affiliates, lines of business, or products, including at

   and applications. We do not control these linked properties and this

   read the privacy policy of any third-party online property that you
   visit before you provide any information to that property’s owner.

How to opt out of interest-based advertising

   technologies to collect information about your visits to our Website

   You may also be able to limit data collection by third parties across
   applications by using your mobile device settings. Please note that
   opting out will not stop advertising from appearing on your browser or
   mobile device. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your
   interests. Additionally, please note that if you use a different
   browser or device, erase cookies from your browser, restrict cookies
   from being used on your browser, or reset your mobile device’s platform
   advertising ID, you may need to renew your opt-out choices.

     * Mobile app vs. mobile web usage and audience behavior
     * Highlights of top-ranking and fast-growing apps
     * App activity among Millennials and other valuable audience segments

2016 U.S. Cross-Platform Future in Focus

   Download Whitepaper

   2015 was another transformative year in media, as TV and digital
   convergence accelerates and the longstanding consumer habits continue
   to be upended. While the media landscape is often described as growing
   increasingly ‘fragmented’, a more accurate description might be that
   it’s becoming increasingly interconnected, with consumers seamlessly
   accessing content across more screens than ever before. The lines
   between desktop, mobile, TV and film are beginning to blur as the
   various platforms are often more distinguished by differences in use
   case than by the underlying technology. As a result of this changing
   landscape, there are a new host of issues and solutions facing
   marketers and publishers, such as how to effectively advertise across
   these platforms and how consumers’ purchasing behavior is shifting over
   time.

   Consider some of the key trends shaping the cross-platform media
   landscape in 2015 and what they suggest about the future. This was the
   year that:
     * The TV landscape continued its shifting of time and space, with
       more delayed, on-demand and digital viewing of TV programming than
       ever before.
     * Digital media usage continued to grow at a fast rate, driven by
       smartphone app usage which is inching closer and closer to 50
       percent of all digital media time spent.
     * Several traditional print publishers made huge gains with their
       digital audiences by making effective use of mobile to attract new
       readers and becoming more digitally-savvy operations.
     * Digital got exceedingly close to becoming the largest advertising
       medium despite facing continued challenges such as viewability,
       invalid traffic (IVT) and the more recent issue of ad blocking.
     * Consumers significantly accelerated their use of mobile devices for
       both shopping and purchase activity.

   In this report, we will examine some of the most important sectors of
   the cross media ecosystem to show how the landscape has changed, who is
   leading the way, and what it all means for the year ahead – and beyond.
   It is an exciting time in the media industry, and we hope this
   exploration of today’s key issues helps put the Cross-Platform Future
   in Focus.

   Comscore, Inc. (“Comscore”, “we”, “us” or “our”) interacts with current
   and prospective clients, investors, and the general public via its
   Website, comscore.com (“Website”), and its mobile application. This
   Privacy Policy describes Comscore’s practices as they relate to the
   collection, use, and disclosure of information gathered from visitors
   to the Website and application that link to this policy. Comscore
   operates a number of research panels, each of which is governed by the
   privacy policy that appears on the Website assigned to that research
   panel.

What information is collected?

   Personal Information.  Comscore collects Personal Information about you
   when you choose to provide such information to us. For example, you may
   provide us with Personal Information when you submit an online form,
   apply for a job, communicate with us by e-mail, or access
   client-specific content. This information may include your name;
   business or personal contact information, such as your address, email
   address or phone number; and any information that you provide as part
   of a job application (collectively, “Personal Information”).

   Data Collected Automatically.  We automatically collect certain
   information about your use of our Website and application. This
   information may include, for example, your IP address, your browser
   type and version, your device identifier, information about your
   computer and operating system, the length of your visit and the pages
   that you viewed on our Website or application. We use cookies and
   similar technologies to collect this information. We also use cookies
   and similar technologies for other purposes such as to ensure
   authorized access to client-specific content, and to track client
   access to such content. Cookies are pieces of data stored on a user’s
   hard drive that contain information about a user. Please note that you
   may be able to view and delete these cookies using the features of your
   browser; however, deleting cookies may prevent you from being able to
   use the full functionality of the Website.

   Our Website and application also automatically create logs regarding
   your activity on our Website. These logs may identify the features that
   you use, the actions that you take, and the information that you
   access. We generally use this information in statistical and aggregate
   formats to assess the effectiveness of our Website and application and
   to better understand your priorities and interests.

   Information Collected by Third Parties.  We may permit third parties to
   use cookies or other technology to collect information about your
   online and application usage activities across our Website and
   application and other websites and applications over time for
   non-advertising purposes such as to help us analyze how visitors use
   our Website and application. We may use Google’s analytics products to
   provide these services. To learn more about how these Google products
   collect and process data and the choices Google may offer to control
   these activities, you may visit
   www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. To learn about
   interest-based advertising activities by third parties on our Website
   and application, please see the information provided below.

   Information Collected for Market Research.  This Website may set tags
   on your browser that collect data for the ScorecardResearch service, a
   service offered by Full Circle Studies, Inc. (“Full Circle Studies”)
   which is also part of the Comscore market research group. You may
   control your level of participation in ScorecardResearch’s market
   research programs by visiting here:
   http://www.scorecardresearch.com/preferences.aspx. We will continue to
   count the fact that a browser came to a site, but we will not associate
   that event with your browser. Additionally, if your mobile device
   platform offers settings to limit data collection for interest-based
   advertising, you can use these settings to opt out of participating in
   our market research programs with respect to our data collection from
   applications on that mobile device.

   Please note that this opt-out is cookie based (i.e., a cookie must be
   on your computer to tell our systems that you have opted-out). If you
   delete, block or otherwise restrict cookies, this opt-out may not be
   effective. Additionally, because different computers and different
   Internet browsers all require their own version of the opt-out cookie,
   you need to perform this opt-out process on any computer and browsers
   that you want to be opted-out.

How is the collected information used?

   We may use the Personal Information that you provide to us to operate
   and improve our business, including this Website and our application;
   to communicate with you; to provide you with information or services

How is the information disclosed?

   Comscore may share your Personal Information as described below:
     * With our vendors, consultants, agents, contractors, and other
       service providers that we use to support our business;
     * To provide you with any information or services that you request;
     * To respond to subpoenas, court orders, and other legal process, or
       as otherwise required by law;
     * To exercise Comscore’s legal rights or defend Comscore against
       legal claims, to enforce our contracts, to investigate, respond to
       and resolve problems or inquiries (including governmental
       inquiries), or to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit
       the damages that we may sustain;
     * In connection with an actual or potential merger, sale,
       acquisition, assignment, or transfer of all or part of our assets,
       affiliates, lines of business, or products, including at
       bankruptcy;
     * With our affiliates, subsidiaries, or parent companies; and
     * With your consent.

Third-Party Links and Services

   Our Website and application may contain links to third-party websites
   and applications. We do not control these linked properties and this
   Privacy Policy does not apply to those properties. We encourage you to
   read the privacy policy of any third-party online property that you
   visit before you provide any information to that property’s owner.

How to opt out of interest-based advertising

   We may partner with third-party companies that may use cookies or other
   technologies to collect information about your visits to our Website
   and application and other non-affiliated websites and applications over
   time, including information about the possible relationships among
   different browsers and devices, in order to provide you with more

   This practice is called interest-based advertising. You may visit

   DAA AppChoices iOS
   DAA AppChoices Android
   DAA AppChoices Amazon

   You may also be able to limit data collection by third parties across
   applications by using your mobile device settings. Please note that
   opting out will not stop advertising from appearing on your browser or
   mobile device. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your
   interests. Additionally, please note that if you use a different
   browser or device, erase cookies from your browser, restrict cookies
   from being used on your browser, or reset your mobile device’s platform
   advertising ID, you may need to renew your opt-out choices.
