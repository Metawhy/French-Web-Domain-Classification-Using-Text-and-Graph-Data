EU officials float €100B boost for European companies
       Brussels gets serious about protecting its businesses against the
       likes of Apple and Alibaba.

       EU officials want to set up a €100 billion wealth fund to bolster
       "European champions" against American and Chinese business rivals
       like Google, Apple and Alibaba.
       The proposal for a so-called European Future Fund appears in an
       unusually radical raft of plans that European Commission officials
       want to put onto the agenda of their president-elect, Ursula von
       der Leyen, whose mandate begins on November 1.
       While the Eurocrats’ 173-page wish list — obtained exclusively by
       POLITICO — ranges from putting beehives on public buildings to
       greater restrictions on social media, the dominant theme is
       building a more defensive Europe that can take hard-hitting trade
       measures against Washington and Beijing, while putting more public
       money into home-grown business heavyweights.
       “The emergence and leadership of private non-EU competitors, with
       unprecedented financial means, has the potential to obliterate the
       existing innovation dynamics and industrial position of EU industry
       in certain sectors,” read the plans for the new fund.
       The officials identify Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft,
       Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent among the companies Europe needs to
       rival. “Europe has no such companies,” their document notes.

     In terms of tackling threats from Donald Trump, the bureaucrats
     propose a highly aggressive new framework to slap tariffs
     unilaterally on the United States.
       The fund would use money from the EU budget to raise at least €100
       billion in public and private funding. Unlike most
       existing research and development funds administered by the bloc,
       this would be invested directly in equity — a sign that Brussels
       may be planning to take a far more lenient line on public funding
       for industry as it seeks to build home-grown talent.
       Delivering a double-punch in defense of Fortress Europe, the
       Commission officials back up their proposals on public funding with
       harder trade policy ideas, specifically targeting the key rivals in
       Washington and Beijing.

The race for Europe’s place in space
            Joshua Posaner
       In terms of tackling threats from Donald Trump, the bureaucrats
       propose a highly aggressive new framework to slap tariffs
       unilaterally on the United States. They justify these unorthodox
       trade defense measures — called an “Enforcement Regulation” — by
       saying Brussels needs to draw up countermeasures in readiness for
       Trump effectively destroying the main global trade arbitration
       court at the World Trade Organization (WTO) by the end of this
       year.
       Without that safety net in Geneva to resolve trade disputes, the
       officials argue that the von der Leyen Commission would need a
       strategy to hit back against Trump’s tariffs outside the usual
       purview of WTO law, effectively plunging commerce back into the law
       of the jungle.

       Europe needs to rival | Hector Retamal/AFP via Getty Images
       To turn the screws on China, the document seeks more stringent
       measures to block Chinese companies from taking part in tenders in
       Europe to penalize them for the level of subsidies that they
       receive from the government in Beijing.
       Responding to the plans, a spokesperson for von der Leyen said that
       “nobody in the [president-elect’s] transition team has heard of
       that mysterious European Future Fund.”

Big ideas
       Brussels already has a firm strategy to invest in research and
       development in strategic industries — ranging from technology
       companies to train firms and the pharmaceutical industry.
       But the new proposal takes efforts to build “European champions” a
       significant step further.
       “The operating mode of the fund would have a long-term, equity
       based focus with a commercial, profit-oriented model,” the
       Commission writes, adding that “this will allow the fund to meet
       the strategic objective of supporting European champions while
       maintaining financial stability.”
       The new fund would use money from the EU budget earmarked for
       venture capital, research funding and regional development. It
       would be overseen by the directorate general for research in
       discussion with five other departments, including those covering
       the budget and financial services.
       The document suggests other expenditures for the next Commission,
       outlining plans to consider an EU-wide unemployment insurance
       program within the first 100 days of the new administration.

       That scheme, floated by von der Leyen in her maiden speech, could
       see the EU directly pay benefits to unemployed people. As an
       alternative — a Brussels-stamped check for the jobless may not find
       popularity among national governments — the Commission could
       propose a reinsurance system in which national benefit programs
       support each other in case of shortfalls, according to the
       document.
       As lawmakers in Europe, the United States and elsewhere look for
       ways to police global social networks, the document also outlines
       plans to put forward regulation in the second half of 2020 that
       would mandate that social networks and other online platforms have
       a “duty of care” for what is published on their sites.
       The proposals would also include new transparency rules to give
       greater clarity over how tech companies regulate content like
       online political advertising.
       Among the more eye-catching ideas outlined, the Commission also
       wants beehives to be installed at public buildings across the EU to
       try to counter the mass death of pollinators.

       KABUL, Afghanistan — The moment you step outside the airport in
       Kabul, Afghanistan, the first thing that strikes you are the roses.
       They are everywhere — lining the dusty motorway into town,
       clustering flowerbeds in traffic circles, blooming in private
       gardens.
       The second thing you see is fear. Foreigners hide behind their
       sandbagged walls, barbed wire, armed guards and bulletproof
       vehicles. But many locals are terrified too, including those who
       fled the country but were recently returned against their will.
       There is every reason to be afraid. The fragile government is
       struggling to make headway against the Taliban, which is likely
       more powerful now than at any time since 2001. Other armed
       opposition groups — including the so-called Islamic State — have
       seized control of parts of the country and carry out devastating
       attacks even in securitized areas of Kabul and elsewhere.
       Violent incidents are increasingly frequent. According to the U.N.,
       2016 was the deadliest year for civilian casualties since its
       records began in 2009. While my Amnesty International colleagues
       and I were in Kabul in May, a German aid worker and an Afghan guard
       were killed, and a Finnish woman likely kidnapped, during an attack
       on a Swedish NGO in the city. Wednesday’s horrific bomb attack near
       the German embassy in central Kabul shows that rather than winding
       down, the conflict in Afghanistan is escalating dangerously.
       British and American authorities warn their citizens against
       traveling to Afghanistan, saying it remains unsafe “due to the
       ongoing risk of kidnapping, hostage-taking, military combat
       operations, landmines, banditry, armed rivalry between political
       and tribal groups” and “insurgent attacks.”

     When Azad found out he was going to be deported, he tried to kill
     himself and was put under suicide watch until he was forcibly
     returned.
       And yet, Western governments have deemed the country safe enough
       for Afghan asylum seekers to return. Over the past decade and a
       half, a number of European countries (as well as Australia) have
       signed Memoranda of Understanding with Afghanistan, through which
       the country agrees to readmit its citizens under certain
       conditions. These types of arrangements are not necessarily
       unreasonable, but their implementation must conform with
       international law, which prohibits states from transferring people
       if there is a risk of serious human rights violations.
       Nonetheless, even as the situation in Afghanistan has unmistakably
       worsened, Western governments have escalated their efforts to
       return Afghans fleeing war and persecution.

Top German politician wants to deport ill migrants, Afghans
            Cynthia Kroet
       At an aid conference in October 2016, under pressure from the
       European Union, the Afghan government signed the EU-Afghanistan
       “Joint Way Forward,” a document that paves the way for the forcible
       return of an unlimited number of Afghans from Europe. One unnamed
       Afghan government official called the agreement a “poisoned cup”
       the country was forced to accept in return for development aid.
       Hundreds of returns have taken place since the agreement was signed
       six months ago. My colleagues and I recently spoke with Afghans
       deported from Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. While
       everyone in Afghanistan is at risk, many of the returnees we spoke
       to were extremely vulnerable, and their returns likely violated
       international law.
       A young man, whom I’ll call “Azad,” is at serious risk because of
       his sexual orientation. Afghanistan criminalizes same-sex sexual
       conduct, and there have been reports of harassment, violence and
       detention by police. When Azad found out he was going to be
       deported, he tried to kill himself and was put under suicide watch
       until he was forcibly returned.
       This was his first time in Kabul, he told me. “I have nowhere to
       go,” he said. “Maybe I will join the other drug addicts in the west
       of the city, just to get some shelter.”
       Despite his young age, Azad has survived a number of tragedies.
       After fleeing the war in Afghanistan as a child, he grew up in
       Iran, and later lost his mother when the family tried to make its
       way to Europe. While clearly frightened throughout our
       conversation, he broke down when speaking about her death. “All I
       want to do is visit her grave.”
       Another man, “Farid,” is in danger of religious persecution for
       converting to Christianity. Like Azad, he left Afghanistan as a
       child, grew up in Iran, then fled to a European country. He is
       terrified about what will happen to him in Afghanistan. Still in
       shock after being wrenched from his adopted country and faith
       community, he said: “I feel like I’ve fallen from the sky. I don’t
       believe I’m here.”

       Azad lives in fear for his life in Kabul | Amnesty International
       He, too, had never been to Kabul. “I don’t know anything about
       Afghanistan,” he told me. “Where will I go? I don’t have funds to
       live alone and I can’t live with relatives because they will see
       that I don’t pray.”
       Their stories are, unfortunately, far from exceptional. Some
       deportees have already suffered violence after being forcibly
       returned to Afghanistan. An Afghan who returned from Germany in
       January was injured in a suicide attack near the Supreme Court just
       two weeks later, according to a recent report by the Afghan
       Analysts Network. Several other people — including young children —
       were injured in attacks by armed groups in Kabul, a member of the
       Afghanistan Migrants Advice and Support Organization told us.
       None of these people should have been sent back. When they walked
       out of the airport, the country was probably as unknown to many of
       them as it was to me — and they face far greater risks.
       European governments and leaders know Afghanistan is not safe. If
       they don’t stop deporting people like Azad and Farid, they will
       have blood on their hands.

       rights at Amnesty International.

Merkel: I didn’t mean 30 days as a fixed Brexit deadline
       ‘The 30 days were meant as an example to highlight the fact that we
       need to achieve it in a short time.’
   By Joshua Posaner

       Updated 8/22/19, 4:49 PM CET
       BERLIN — When Angela Merkel said a no-deal Brexit could be averted
       within 30 days, she didn't actually mean 30 days.
       The German chancellor told Boris Johnson on Wednesday she sees
       "possibilities" to solve the Irish backstop problem and avoid a
       no-deal Brexit but it is up to the U.K. to come up with a workable
       plan. "We can maybe find it in the next 30 days," the chancellor
       said, standing alongside Johnson in Berlin.
       A day later and Merkel clarified what she meant. “I said that what
       one can achieve in three or two years can also be achieved in 30
       days," she said during a visit to The Hague, according to Reuters.
       “The 30 days were meant as an example to highlight the fact that we
       need to achieve it in a short time because Britain had said they
       want to leave the European Union on October 31,” Merkel said.
       French President Emmanuel Macron said Thursday that the U.K. and EU
       will not be able to find a new Brexit agreement that's different to
       the existing one in 30 days.

In Bavaria, Black is the new Green
       Bavaria’s premier Markus Söder sees the political upside in talking
       about the environment.

       MUNICH — Bavaria’s conservative state premier wants voters to
       believe he’s seen the light on climate protection.
       In recent weeks, Markus Söder has voiced support for efforts to
       enshrine climate protection in Germany's constitution and announced
       plans to plant 30 million trees. He wants to introduce a series of
       eco-friendly measures in September, including a climate budget and
       car tax reform, and even called for a faster exit from coal.
       All that marks a sharp deviation from the traditional approach of
       his Christian Social Union (CSU), Bavaria's sister party to
       Chancellor Angela Merkel's governing Christian Democratic Union
       (CDU) and a regional powerhouse that has dominated post-war
       politics in Germany's wealthiest state.
       Climate protection hasn't been much of a priority for the party in
       the past and Söder's eco-shift stands in stark contrast to his
       campaign ahead of the 2018 Bavarian election, during which the CSU
       moved to the right. Its manifesto included no mention of climate
       change.
       Less than a year later, Söder has changed his tune. "It's simply
       urgent," he said at his annual summer press conference in Berlin.
       "We need to take decisions now to save Creation," he added, using a
       biblical reference aimed at his party's Christian base.
       But his political rivals question the depth of his conversion.

Green skepticism
       "It's important to understand that it's not the CSU that has
       changed its tune, it's just Söder," Hans Urban, a Green lawmaker in
       the Bavarian state parliament, told POLITICO. "And he had big
       problems communicating that within his party," he added. "Many in
       the party could hardly choke back their anger."
       While a handful of his party colleagues, such as former Transport
       Minister Alexander Dobrindt, have also pitched in with ideas,
       plenty of CSU members were less enthusiastic about Söder's sudden
       green shift, and his suggestion of a faster coal phase-out prompted
       a rebuke from Berlin.

5 takeaways from Germany’s regional elections
            Matthew Karnitschnig
       Many environmentalists aren't impressed either. While welcoming the
       Bavarian premier's greater focus on climate change, Greens have
       criticized Söder's proposals as either going not far enough — the
       CSU chief remains opposed to a carbon tax, for instance — or as
       empty promises.
       Urban pointed to the Bavarian government's restriction on wind
       power stations as an example. "His pledge to build 200 windmills in
       Bavaria is simply not credible because he's not removing the rule
       to build them far away from houses," he said. "That means there
       just won't be enough space."

       village | Christof Stache/AFP via Getty Images
       According to the so-called 10-H rule introduced under Söder's
       predecessor Horst Seehofer — who now serves as federal interior
       minister — wind turbines must be built at least 10 times their own
       height from any habitation — which works out to more than 2
       kilometers. However, there are only few spots in Bavaria that meet
       this requirement, making the development of new installations
       difficult.
       Meanwhile, Söder's attempts to forge a greener image could be
       upended by an ongoing court case.
       The NGO Deutsche Umwelthilfe wants to hold the Bavarian premier
       personally responsible for failing to implement court-ordered
       measures to tackle endemic levels of cars pollution in parts of
       Munich.
       The NGO's leader Jürgen Resch accused Söder and other senior
       Bavarian politicians of ignoring the court decisions, and wants
       them held in jail for contempt of court. Söder denies he's done
       anything wrong.
       The European Court of Justice held a hearing in the case on
       Tuesday. One of the court’s lawyers will issue an opinion November
       14 ahead of a final decision.

Electoral threat
       Some of Söder's critics view his ecological U-turn as a ploy to win
       back votes from the Greens. His 2018 attempt to pull the CSU to the
       right to stop losing votes to the far-right Alternative for Germany
       (AfD) failed. The CSU won 37 percent in the state election, a
       historic low, the Greens surged to second place with 18 percent
       while the AfD took a record 10 percent.
       On a federal level, the Greens are within touching distance of the
       CDU/CSU alliance at around 25 percent, according to recent polls.
       In May's European Parliament election the Greens were in second
       place in Bavaria with 19 percent of the vote, although far behind
       the still-dominant CSU, which took 41 percent.
       Since outlining the green plan, Söder's personal popularity
       has soared, rising by 17 percentage points to overtake the Greens'
       national co-leader Robert Habeck, according to one nationwide poll.

     "The green element is going to have to remain an integral part of
     the party program" — Heinrich Oberreuter, professor of political
     science and CSU member
       Söder's green shift is creating expectations of a change in
       environmental policy among many voters, which is leading to
       tensions with the CSU's traditional backers.
       The Bavarian government has already been forced to move on
       environmental politics this spring following a mass petition
       calling for a new conservation law. The state now has Germany's
       strictest rules aimed at protecting bees and other insects,
       irritating the powerful agriculture lobby BBV, an old ally.
       "It means yet more rules for Bavarian farmers," said Georg Wimmer,
       the BBV's deputy secretary-general.
       Heinrich Oberreuter, professor emeritus of political science at the
       University of Passau — and a CSU member — said the petition's
       success "marked a painful setback for the CSU."

     "It's good if more and more politicians put climate change on their
     agenda" — Climate change protester
       Oberreuter said his party's reorientation is an attempt to connect
       with the prevalent political mood. "Climate change and the
       environment are topics of the future," he said, adding that it is
       important to address such issues to reach young voters left cold by
       the CSU's more traditional conservative policies.
       "The green element is going to have to remain an integral part of
       the party program," Oberreuter added. He said that Söder's strategy
       may well succeed in winning back voters from the Greens if the CSU
       "manages to convey the message that a one-topic approach is
       unsustainable and that a balance needs to be struck between
       ecological objectives and the economy."
       Such a centrist stance doesn't strike a chord with climate
       activists, however.
       "It's good if more and more politicians put climate change on their
       agenda," one protester at a Fridays for Future demonstration in
       Munich's historic center said on a particularly quiet day in
       mid-August that saw the activists outnumbered by tourists waiting
       for the famous Glockenspiel.

       "But it's not enough," he added. Yet to him, even the Greens aren't
       going far enough — he criticized the party as "hypocrites," citing
       a picture posted by a Greens leader showing her eating ice cream
       with a plastic spoon in California.
       Despite such criticism, the Greens' rise in Bavaria continues.
       Recent polls put them at 22 percent, with the CSU's support at 37
       percent.
       Many voters, meanwhile, eye Söder's green about-face with
       skepticism. Half of Bavarians don't believe his change of heart to
       be genuine, according to one poll, while in a nationwide survey,
       only 28 percent of Germans described Söder's climate policy
       announcements as credible.

   The proposal for a so-called European Future Fund appears in an
   unusually radical raft of plans that European Commission officials want
   to put onto the agenda of their president-elect, Ursula von der Leyen,
   whose mandate begins on November 1.

   While the Eurocrats’ 173-page wish list — obtained exclusively by
   POLITICO — ranges from putting beehives on public buildings to greater
   restrictions on social media, the dominant theme is building a more
   defensive Europe that can take hard-hitting trade measures against
   Washington and Beijing, while putting more public money into home-grown
   business heavyweights.

   “The emergence and leadership of private non-EU competitors, with
   unprecedented financial means, has the potential to obliterate the
   existing innovation dynamics and industrial position of EU industry in
   certain sectors,” read the plans for the new fund.

   The officials identify Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft,
   Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent among the companies Europe needs to rival.
   “Europe has no such companies,” their document notes.

     In terms of tackling threats from Donald Trump, the bureaucrats
     propose a highly aggressive new framework to slap tariffs
     unilaterally on the United States.

   The fund would use money from the EU budget to raise at least €100
   billion in public and private funding. Unlike most existing research
   and development funds administered by the bloc, this would be invested
   directly in equity — a sign that Brussels may be planning to take a far
   more lenient line on public funding for industry as it seeks to build
   home-grown talent.

   Delivering a double-punch in defense of Fortress Europe, the Commission
   officials back up their proposals on public funding with harder trade
   policy ideas, specifically targeting the key rivals in Washington and
   Beijing.

The race for Europe’s place in space

   In terms of tackling threats from Donald Trump, the bureaucrats propose
   a highly aggressive new framework to slap tariffs unilaterally on the
   United States. They justify these unorthodox trade defense measures —
   called an “Enforcement Regulation” — by saying Brussels needs to draw
   up countermeasures in readiness for Trump effectively destroying the
   main global trade arbitration court at the World Trade Organization
   (WTO) by the end of this year.

   Without that safety net in Geneva to resolve trade disputes, the
   officials argue that the von der Leyen Commission would need a strategy
   to hit back against Trump’s tariffs outside the usual purview of WTO
   law, effectively plunging commerce back into the law of the jungle.

   To turn the screws on China, the document seeks more stringent measures
   to block Chinese companies from taking part in tenders in Europe to
   penalize them for the level of subsidies that they receive from the
   government in Beijing.

   Responding to the plans, a spokesperson for von der Leyen said that
   “nobody in the [president-elect’s] transition team has heard of that
   mysterious European Future Fund.”

Big ideas

   Brussels already has a firm strategy to invest in research and
   development in strategic industries — ranging from technology companies
   to train firms and the pharmaceutical industry.

   But the new proposal takes efforts to build “European champions” a
   significant step further.

   “The operating mode of the fund would have a long-term, equity based
   focus with a commercial, profit-oriented model,” the Commission writes,
   adding that “this will allow the fund to meet the strategic objective
   of supporting European champions while maintaining financial
   stability.”

   The new fund would use money from the EU budget earmarked for venture
   capital, research funding and regional development. It would be
   overseen by the directorate general for research in discussion with
   five other departments, including those covering the budget and
   financial services.

   The document suggests other expenditures for the next Commission,
   outlining plans to consider an EU-wide unemployment insurance program
   within the first 100 days of the new administration.

   That scheme, floated by von der Leyen in her maiden speech, could see
   the EU directly pay benefits to unemployed people. As an alternative
   — a Brussels-stamped check for the jobless may not find popularity
   among national governments — the Commission could propose a reinsurance
   system in which national benefit programs support each other in case of
   shortfalls, according to the document.

   As lawmakers in Europe, the United States and elsewhere look for ways
   to police global social networks, the document also outlines plans
   to put forward regulation in the second half of 2020 that would mandate
   that social networks and other online platforms have a “duty of care”
   for what is published on their sites.

   The proposals would also include new transparency rules to give greater
   clarity over how tech companies regulate content like online political
   advertising.

   Among the more eye-catching ideas outlined, the Commission also wants
   beehives to be installed at public buildings across the EU to try to
   counter the mass death of pollinators.

EU officials float €100B boost for European companies
       Brussels gets serious about protecting its businesses against the

       EU officials want to set up a €100 billion wealth fund to bolster
       "European champions" against American and Chinese business rivals
       like Google, Apple and Alibaba.
       The proposal for a so-called European Future Fund appears in an
       unusually radical raft of plans that European Commission officials
       want to put onto the agenda of their president-elect, Ursula von
       der Leyen, whose mandate begins on November 1.
       While the Eurocrats’ 173-page wish list — obtained exclusively by
       POLITICO — ranges from putting beehives on public buildings to
       greater restrictions on social media, the dominant theme is
       building a more defensive Europe that can take hard-hitting trade
       measures against Washington and Beijing, while putting more public
       money into home-grown business heavyweights.
       “The emergence and leadership of private non-EU competitors, with
       unprecedented financial means, has the potential to obliterate the
       existing innovation dynamics and industrial position of EU industry
       in certain sectors,” read the plans for the new fund.
       The officials identify Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft,
       Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent among the companies Europe needs to
       rival. “Europe has no such companies,” their document notes.

     In terms of tackling threats from Donald Trump, the bureaucrats
     propose a highly aggressive new framework to slap tariffs
     unilaterally on the United States.
       The fund would use money from the EU budget to raise at least €100
       billion in public and private funding. Unlike most
       existing research and development funds administered by the bloc,
       this would be invested directly in equity — a sign that Brussels
       may be planning to take a far more lenient line on public funding
       for industry as it seeks to build home-grown talent.
       Delivering a double-punch in defense of Fortress Europe, the
       Commission officials back up their proposals on public funding with
       harder trade policy ideas, specifically targeting the key rivals in

The race for Europe’s place in space
            Joshua Posaner
       In terms of tackling threats from Donald Trump, the bureaucrats
       propose a highly aggressive new framework to slap tariffs
       unilaterally on the United States. They justify these unorthodox
       trade defense measures — called an “Enforcement Regulation” — by
       saying Brussels needs to draw up countermeasures in readiness for
       Trump effectively destroying the main global trade arbitration
       court at the World Trade Organization (WTO) by the end of this
       year.
       Without that safety net in Geneva to resolve trade disputes, the
       officials argue that the von der Leyen Commission would need a
       strategy to hit back against Trump’s tariffs outside the usual
       purview of WTO law, effectively plunging commerce back into the law
       of the jungle.

       To turn the screws on China, the document seeks more stringent
       measures to block Chinese companies from taking part in tenders in
       Europe to penalize them for the level of subsidies that they
       receive from the government in Beijing.
       Responding to the plans, a spokesperson for von der Leyen said that
       “nobody in the [president-elect’s] transition team has heard of
       that mysterious European Future Fund.”

Big ideas
       Brussels already has a firm strategy to invest in research and
       development in strategic industries — ranging from technology
       companies to train firms and the pharmaceutical industry.
       But the new proposal takes efforts to build “European champions” a
       significant step further.
       “The operating mode of the fund would have a long-term, equity
       based focus with a commercial, profit-oriented model,” the
       Commission writes, adding that “this will allow the fund to meet
       the strategic objective of supporting European champions while
       maintaining financial stability.”
       The new fund would use money from the EU budget earmarked for
       venture capital, research funding and regional development. It
       would be overseen by the directorate general for research in
       discussion with five other departments, including those covering
       the budget and financial services.
       The document suggests other expenditures for the next Commission,
       outlining plans to consider an EU-wide unemployment insurance
       program within the first 100 days of the new administration.

       That scheme, floated by von der Leyen in her maiden speech, could
       see the EU directly pay benefits to unemployed people. As an
       alternative — a Brussels-stamped check for the jobless may not find
       popularity among national governments — the Commission could
       propose a reinsurance system in which national benefit programs
       support each other in case of shortfalls, according to the
       document.
       As lawmakers in Europe, the United States and elsewhere look for
       ways to police global social networks, the document also outlines
       plans to put forward regulation in the second half of 2020 that
       would mandate that social networks and other online platforms have
       a “duty of care” for what is published on their sites.
       The proposals would also include new transparency rules to give
       greater clarity over how tech companies regulate content like
       online political advertising.
       Among the more eye-catching ideas outlined, the Commission also
       wants beehives to be installed at public buildings across the EU to
       try to counter the mass death of pollinators.

When going home is a death sentence
       Forcibly sending refugees back to an unsafe country violates

       KABUL, Afghanistan — The moment you step outside the airport in
       Kabul, Afghanistan, the first thing that strikes you are the roses.
       They are everywhere — lining the dusty motorway into town,
       clustering flowerbeds in traffic circles, blooming in private
       gardens.
       The second thing you see is fear. Foreigners hide behind their
       sandbagged walls, barbed wire, armed guards and bulletproof
       vehicles. But many locals are terrified too, including those who
       fled the country but were recently returned against their will.
       There is every reason to be afraid. The fragile government is
       struggling to make headway against the Taliban, which is likely
       more powerful now than at any time since 2001. Other armed
       opposition groups — including the so-called Islamic State — have
       seized control of parts of the country and carry out devastating
       attacks even in securitized areas of Kabul and elsewhere.
       Violent incidents are increasingly frequent. According to the U.N.,
       2016 was the deadliest year for civilian casualties since its
       records began in 2009. While my Amnesty International colleagues
       and I were in Kabul in May, a German aid worker and an Afghan guard
       were killed, and a Finnish woman likely kidnapped, during an attack
       on a Swedish NGO in the city. Wednesday’s horrific bomb attack near
       the German embassy in central Kabul shows that rather than winding
       down, the conflict in Afghanistan is escalating dangerously.
       British and American authorities warn their citizens against
       traveling to Afghanistan, saying it remains unsafe “due to the
       ongoing risk of kidnapping, hostage-taking, military combat
       operations, landmines, banditry, armed rivalry between political
       and tribal groups” and “insurgent attacks.”

     When Azad found out he was going to be deported, he tried to kill
     himself and was put under suicide watch until he was forcibly
     returned.
       And yet, Western governments have deemed the country safe enough
       for Afghan asylum seekers to return. Over the past decade and a
       half, a number of European countries (as well as Australia) have
       signed Memoranda of Understanding with Afghanistan, through which
       the country agrees to readmit its citizens under certain
       conditions. These types of arrangements are not necessarily
       unreasonable, but their implementation must conform with
       international law, which prohibits states from transferring people
       if there is a risk of serious human rights violations.
       Nonetheless, even as the situation in Afghanistan has unmistakably
       worsened, Western governments have escalated their efforts to
       return Afghans fleeing war and persecution.

Top German politician wants to deport ill migrants, Afghans
            Cynthia Kroet
       At an aid conference in October 2016, under pressure from the
       European Union, the Afghan government signed the EU-Afghanistan
       “Joint Way Forward,” a document that paves the way for the forcible
       return of an unlimited number of Afghans from Europe. One unnamed
       Afghan government official called the agreement a “poisoned cup”
       the country was forced to accept in return for development aid.
       Hundreds of returns have taken place since the agreement was signed
       six months ago. My colleagues and I recently spoke with Afghans
       deported from Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. While
       everyone in Afghanistan is at risk, many of the returnees we spoke
       to were extremely vulnerable, and their returns likely violated
       international law.
       A young man, whom I’ll call “Azad,” is at serious risk because of
       his sexual orientation. Afghanistan criminalizes same-sex sexual
       conduct, and there have been reports of harassment, violence and
       detention by police. When Azad found out he was going to be
       deported, he tried to kill himself and was put under suicide watch
       until he was forcibly returned.
       This was his first time in Kabul, he told me. “I have nowhere to
       go,” he said. “Maybe I will join the other drug addicts in the west
       of the city, just to get some shelter.”
       Despite his young age, Azad has survived a number of tragedies.
       After fleeing the war in Afghanistan as a child, he grew up in
       Iran, and later lost his mother when the family tried to make its
       way to Europe. While clearly frightened throughout our
       conversation, he broke down when speaking about her death. “All I
       want to do is visit her grave.”
       Another man, “Farid,” is in danger of religious persecution for
       converting to Christianity. Like Azad, he left Afghanistan as a
       child, grew up in Iran, then fled to a European country. He is
       terrified about what will happen to him in Afghanistan. Still in
       shock after being wrenched from his adopted country and faith
       community, he said: “I feel like I’ve fallen from the sky. I don’t
       believe I’m here.”

       Azad lives in fear for his life in Kabul | Amnesty International
       He, too, had never been to Kabul. “I don’t know anything about
       Afghanistan,” he told me. “Where will I go? I don’t have funds to
       live alone and I can’t live with relatives because they will see
       that I don’t pray.”
       Their stories are, unfortunately, far from exceptional. Some
       deportees have already suffered violence after being forcibly
       returned to Afghanistan. An Afghan who returned from Germany in
       January was injured in a suicide attack near the Supreme Court just
       two weeks later, according to a recent report by the Afghan
       Analysts Network. Several other people — including young children —
       were injured in attacks by armed groups in Kabul, a member of the
       Afghanistan Migrants Advice and Support Organization told us.
       None of these people should have been sent back. When they walked
       out of the airport, the country was probably as unknown to many of
       them as it was to me — and they face far greater risks.
       European governments and leaders know Afghanistan is not safe. If
       they don’t stop deporting people like Azad and Farid, they will
       have blood on their hands.

Merkel: I didn’t mean 30 days as a fixed Brexit deadline
       ‘The 30 days were meant as an example to highlight the fact that we
       need to achieve it in a short time.’
   By Joshua Posaner
       8/22/19, 4:40 PM CET
       Updated 8/22/19, 4:49 PM CET
       BERLIN — When Angela Merkel said a no-deal Brexit could be averted
       within 30 days, she didn't actually mean 30 days.
       The German chancellor told Boris Johnson on Wednesday she sees
       "possibilities" to solve the Irish backstop problem and avoid a
       no-deal Brexit but it is up to the U.K. to come up with a workable
       plan. "We can maybe find it in the next 30 days," the chancellor
       said, standing alongside Johnson in Berlin.
       A day later and Merkel clarified what she meant. “I said that what
       one can achieve in three or two years can also be achieved in 30
       days," she said during a visit to The Hague, according to Reuters.
       “The 30 days were meant as an example to highlight the fact that we
       need to achieve it in a short time because Britain had said they
       want to leave the European Union on October 31,” Merkel said.
       French President Emmanuel Macron said Thursday that the U.K. and EU
       will not be able to find a new Brexit agreement that's different to
       the existing one in 30 days.

In Bavaria, Black is the new Green
       Bavaria’s premier Markus Söder sees the political upside in talking
       about the environment.

       MUNICH — Bavaria’s conservative state premier wants voters to
       believe he’s seen the light on climate protection.
       In recent weeks, Markus Söder has voiced support for efforts to
       enshrine climate protection in Germany's constitution and announced
       plans to plant 30 million trees. He wants to introduce a series of
       eco-friendly measures in September, including a climate budget and
       car tax reform, and even called for a faster exit from coal.
       All that marks a sharp deviation from the traditional approach of
       his Christian Social Union (CSU), Bavaria's sister party to
       Chancellor Angela Merkel's governing Christian Democratic Union
       (CDU) and a regional powerhouse that has dominated post-war
       politics in Germany's wealthiest state.
       Climate protection hasn't been much of a priority for the party in
       the past and Söder's eco-shift stands in stark contrast to his
       campaign ahead of the 2018 Bavarian election, during which the CSU
       moved to the right. Its manifesto included no mention of climate
       change.
       Less than a year later, Söder has changed his tune. "It's simply
       urgent," he said at his annual summer press conference in Berlin.
       "We need to take decisions now to save Creation," he added, using a
       biblical reference aimed at his party's Christian base.
       But his political rivals question the depth of his conversion.

Green skepticism
       "It's important to understand that it's not the CSU that has
       changed its tune, it's just Söder," Hans Urban, a Green lawmaker in
       the Bavarian state parliament, told POLITICO. "And he had big
       problems communicating that within his party," he added. "Many in
       the party could hardly choke back their anger."
       While a handful of his party colleagues, such as former Transport
       Minister Alexander Dobrindt, have also pitched in with ideas,
       plenty of CSU members were less enthusiastic about Söder's sudden
       green shift, and his suggestion of a faster coal phase-out prompted
       a rebuke from Berlin.

5 takeaways from Germany’s regional elections
            Matthew Karnitschnig
       Many environmentalists aren't impressed either. While welcoming the
       Bavarian premier's greater focus on climate change, Greens have
       criticized Söder's proposals as either going not far enough — the
       CSU chief remains opposed to a carbon tax, for instance — or as
       empty promises.
       Urban pointed to the Bavarian government's restriction on wind
       power stations as an example. "His pledge to build 200 windmills in
       Bavaria is simply not credible because he's not removing the rule
       to build them far away from houses," he said. "That means there
       just won't be enough space."

       village | Christof Stache/AFP via Getty Images
       According to the so-called 10-H rule introduced under Söder's
       predecessor Horst Seehofer — who now serves as federal interior
       minister — wind turbines must be built at least 10 times their own
       height from any habitation — which works out to more than 2
       kilometers. However, there are only few spots in Bavaria that meet
       this requirement, making the development of new installations
       difficult.
       Meanwhile, Söder's attempts to forge a greener image could be
       upended by an ongoing court case.
       The NGO Deutsche Umwelthilfe wants to hold the Bavarian premier
       personally responsible for failing to implement court-ordered
       measures to tackle endemic levels of cars pollution in parts of
       Munich.
       The NGO's leader Jürgen Resch accused Söder and other senior
       Bavarian politicians of ignoring the court decisions, and wants
       them held in jail for contempt of court. Söder denies he's done
       anything wrong.
       The European Court of Justice held a hearing in the case on
       Tuesday. One of the court’s lawyers will issue an opinion November
       14 ahead of a final decision.

Electoral threat
       Some of Söder's critics view his ecological U-turn as a ploy to win
       back votes from the Greens. His 2018 attempt to pull the CSU to the
       right to stop losing votes to the far-right Alternative for Germany
       (AfD) failed. The CSU won 37 percent in the state election, a
       historic low, the Greens surged to second place with 18 percent
       while the AfD took a record 10 percent.
       On a federal level, the Greens are within touching distance of the
       CDU/CSU alliance at around 25 percent, according to recent polls.
       In May's European Parliament election the Greens were in second
       place in Bavaria with 19 percent of the vote, although far behind
       the still-dominant CSU, which took 41 percent.
       Since outlining the green plan, Söder's personal popularity
       has soared, rising by 17 percentage points to overtake the Greens'
       national co-leader Robert Habeck, according to one nationwide poll.

     "The green element is going to have to remain an integral part of
     the party program" — Heinrich Oberreuter, professor of political
     science and CSU member
       Söder's green shift is creating expectations of a change in
       environmental policy among many voters, which is leading to
       tensions with the CSU's traditional backers.
       The Bavarian government has already been forced to move on
       environmental politics this spring following a mass petition
       calling for a new conservation law. The state now has Germany's
       strictest rules aimed at protecting bees and other insects,
       irritating the powerful agriculture lobby BBV, an old ally.
       "It means yet more rules for Bavarian farmers," said Georg Wimmer,
       the BBV's deputy secretary-general.
       Heinrich Oberreuter, professor emeritus of political science at the
       University of Passau — and a CSU member — said the petition's
       success "marked a painful setback for the CSU."

     "It's good if more and more politicians put climate change on their
     agenda" — Climate change protester
       Oberreuter said his party's reorientation is an attempt to connect
       with the prevalent political mood. "Climate change and the
       environment are topics of the future," he said, adding that it is
       important to address such issues to reach young voters left cold by
       the CSU's more traditional conservative policies.
       "The green element is going to have to remain an integral part of
       the party program," Oberreuter added. He said that Söder's strategy
       may well succeed in winning back voters from the Greens if the CSU
       "manages to convey the message that a one-topic approach is
       unsustainable and that a balance needs to be struck between
       ecological objectives and the economy."
       Such a centrist stance doesn't strike a chord with climate
       activists, however.
       "It's good if more and more politicians put climate change on their
       agenda," one protester at a Fridays for Future demonstration in
       Munich's historic center said on a particularly quiet day in
       mid-August that saw the activists outnumbered by tourists waiting
       for the famous Glockenspiel.

       "But it's not enough," he added. Yet to him, even the Greens aren't
       going far enough — he criticized the party as "hypocrites," citing
       a picture posted by a Greens leader showing her eating ice cream
       with a plastic spoon in California.
       Despite such criticism, the Greens' rise in Bavaria continues.
       Recent polls put them at 22 percent, with the CSU's support at 37
       percent.
       Many voters, meanwhile, eye Söder's green about-face with
       skepticism. Half of Bavarians don't believe his change of heart to
       be genuine, according to one poll, while in a nationwide survey,
       only 28 percent of Germans described Söder's climate policy
       announcements as credible.

EU officials float €100B boost for European companies

   Brussels gets serious about protecting its businesses against the likes
   of Apple and Alibaba.

   The European Commission has an unusually radical wish-list for the new
   mandate | Mauro Bottaro/European Union

   EU officials want to set up a €100 billion wealth fund to bolster
   “European champions” against American and Chinese business rivals like
   Google, Apple and Alibaba.

   The proposal for a so-called European Future Fund appears in an
   unusually radical raft of plans that European Commission officials want
   to put onto the agenda of their president-elect, Ursula von der Leyen,
   whose mandate begins on November 1.

   While the Eurocrats’ 173-page wish list — obtained exclusively by
   POLITICO — ranges from putting beehives on public buildings to greater
   restrictions on social media, the dominant theme is building a more
   defensive Europe that can take hard-hitting trade measures against
   Washington and Beijing, while putting more public money into home-grown
   business heavyweights.

   “The emergence and leadership of private non-EU competitors, with
   unprecedented financial means, has the potential to obliterate the
   existing innovation dynamics and industrial position of EU industry in
   certain sectors,” read the plans for the new fund.

   The officials identify Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft,
   Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent among the companies Europe needs to rival.
   “Europe has no such companies,” their document notes.

     In terms of tackling threats from Donald Trump, the bureaucrats
     propose a highly aggressive new framework to slap tariffs
     unilaterally on the United States.

   The fund would use money from the EU budget to raise at least €100
   billion in public and private funding. Unlike most existing research
   and development funds administered by the bloc, this would be invested
   directly in equity — a sign that Brussels may be planning to take a far
   more lenient line on public funding for industry as it seeks to build
   home-grown talent.

   Delivering a double-punch in defense of Fortress Europe, the Commission
   officials back up their proposals on public funding with harder trade
   policy ideas, specifically targeting the key rivals in Washington and
   Beijing.

The race for Europe’s place in space
       Joshua Posaner

   In terms of tackling threats from Donald Trump, the bureaucrats propose
   a highly aggressive new framework to slap tariffs unilaterally on the
   United States. They justify these unorthodox trade defense measures —
   called an “Enforcement Regulation” — by saying Brussels needs to draw
   up countermeasures in readiness for Trump effectively destroying the
   main global trade arbitration court at the World Trade Organization
   (WTO) by the end of this year.

   Without that safety net in Geneva to resolve trade disputes, the
   officials argue that the von der Leyen Commission would need a strategy
   to hit back against Trump’s tariffs outside the usual purview of WTO
   law, effectively plunging commerce back into the law of the jungle.

   needs to rival | Hector Retamal/AFP via Getty Images

   To turn the screws on China, the document seeks more stringent measures
   to block Chinese companies from taking part in tenders in Europe to
   penalize them for the level of subsidies that they receive from the
   government in Beijing.

   Responding to the plans, a spokesperson for von der Leyen said that
   “nobody in the [president-elect’s] transition team has heard of that
   mysterious European Future Fund.”

Big ideas

   Brussels already has a firm strategy to invest in research and
   development in strategic industries — ranging from technology companies
   to train firms and the pharmaceutical industry.

   But the new proposal takes efforts to build “European champions” a
   significant step further.

   “The operating mode of the fund would have a long-term, equity based
   focus with a commercial, profit-oriented model,” the Commission writes,
   adding that “this will allow the fund to meet the strategic objective
   of supporting European champions while maintaining financial
   stability.”

   The new fund would use money from the EU budget earmarked for venture
   capital, research funding and regional development. It would be
   overseen by the directorate general for research in discussion with
   five other departments, including those covering the budget and
   financial services.

   The document suggests other expenditures for the next Commission,
   outlining plans to consider an EU-wide unemployment insurance program
   within the first 100 days of the new administration.

   That scheme, floated by von der Leyen in her maiden speech, could see
   the EU directly pay benefits to unemployed people. As an alternative
   — a Brussels-stamped check for the jobless may not find popularity
   among national governments — the Commission could propose a reinsurance
   system in which national benefit programs support each other in case of
   shortfalls, according to the document.

   As lawmakers in Europe, the United States and elsewhere look for ways
   to police global social networks, the document also outlines plans
   to put forward regulation in the second half of 2020 that would mandate
   that social networks and other online platforms have a “duty of care”
   for what is published on their sites.

   The proposals would also include new transparency rules to give greater
   clarity over how tech companies regulate content like online political
   advertising.

   Among the more eye-catching ideas outlined, the Commission also wants
   beehives to be installed at public buildings across the EU to try to
   counter the mass death of pollinators.

   Leyen’s spokesperson.

Trump again denounces ‘horrific terrorist attack’
       ‘As president, I will do what is necessary is to prevent this
       threat from spreading to our shores,’ President Donald Trump said.
   By Rebecca Morin
       6/5/17, 3:54 AM CET
       U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday called the attacks in London
       a "horrific terrorist attack," adding that he will do whatever is
       necessary to prevent such threats from reaching the United States.
       "We renew our resolve, stronger than ever before, to protect the
       United States and its allies from a vile enemy that has waged war
       on innocent life," Trump said while attending the Ford's Theatre
       Annual Gala, according to pool reports.
       "And it has gone on too long. This bloodshed must end. This
       bloodshed will end. As president, I will do what is necessary is to
       prevent this threat from spreading to our shores."
       Trump, who had earlier tweeted an assortment of remarks about the
       attack both Saturday night and Sunday morning, also said he spoke
       with British Prime Minister Theresa May to "express our unwavering
       support," according to the pool report. He also said the U.S. will
       do everything in its power to assist the United Kingdom to "bring
       those that are guilty to justice" and that "American sends our
       thoughts and prayers."
       The Saturday night terrorist attack claimed seven lives, left
       dozens more hospitalized and ended with police shooting dead three
       attackers.

Merkel and Schulz fight over who’s better European
       The German chancellor and her challenger are fighting on two fronts
       to claim the title of European champion.

       BERLIN — Who can make Europe great again?
       That question has become central in Germany's general election
       campaign, with conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel and her Social
       Democrat challenger Martin Schulz battling to be seen as the
       candidate best placed to strengthen the European Union.
       After so many years of Euro-pessimism, the EU is suddenly seen as a
       vote winner, as it was in France for Emmanuel Macron last
       month. Both Merkel and Schulz have increased the emphasis on Europe
       in their campaigns for September's parliamentary election, sensing
       that voters see a strong EU as the best response to uncertainty
       caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's moves away from established
       international alliances, Russia's increased military
       assertiveness in Eastern Europe and Britain's Brexit vote.
       The Social Democrats had thought European integration would be a
       winning issue for them, as Schulz is a former president of the
       European Parliament who spent more than two decades in Brussels.
       Moreover, he is running against a chancellor whose longtime Finance
       Minister Wolfgang Schäuble has become the epitome of austerity
       policies that have divided the EU between its wealthier north and
       southern countries hit hard by the sovereign debt crisis, such as
       Greece.
       But Merkel has proved adept at exploiting her status as the EU's
       pre-eminent political leader, most recently in the beer hall speech
       that went around the world — in which the chancellor lamented that
       Europe could no longer fully rely on others and declared: "We
       Europeans truly have to take our fate into our own hands."

     It's not the first time that the Social Democrats have tried to
     claim Macron as one of their own.
       Since then, her conservative bloc has managed to increase an
       already substantial lead over the SPD in opinion polls. It now has
       the support of 39 percent of voters — 14 percentage points ahead of
       the SPD at 25 percent, according to a survey by public broadcaster
       ZDF.
       But the SPD is not about to give up on the EU as an election issue.

Germans lose appetite for Greens
            Janosch Delcker
       “Europe needs to be moved into the center of the campaign," Michael
       Roth, the SPD's minister of state for Europe, said at a conference
       at the foreign ministry on Thursday.
       "There are entirely different ideas about what a united Europe
       means," Roth said. It will now be up to the SPD to explain how
       their vision of Europe is different from Merkel's — and to persuade
       German voters that it's also more attractive.
       The battle to be the best European is being fought on two fronts:

1. Making the most of Macron
       After the charismatic pro-European candidate Macron won France's
       presidential election in May, the idea of the Franco-German axis as
       a guarantor of stability in Europe became a central theme in the
       German election campaign. That idea was reinforced by Trump's
       appearances at NATO and G7 summits that cast doubt on Washington's
       reliability as an ally.
       The Social Democrats' great fear is that Merkel, who appears
       regularly on the global stage alongside Macron, will be primarily
       associated with this Franco-German engine — even though she and
       Macron differ on details of how to reform Europe.
       So the SPD is trying to send out the message that if German voters
       truly want the European Union to change, new faces in both Paris
       and Berlin will be necessary. And the party is not being too subtle
       about it either.

       “Macron needs a dynamic politician with experience in European
       politics as his partner,” Schulz told a crowd gathered in the
       SPD-led foreign ministry in Berlin on Thursday.
       He stressed that he knew Macron well and the two of them had
       discussed some of the French president's proposals for EU reform
       back when Schulz was head of the European Parliament and Macron was
       France's economy minister.
       “And I remember very well that the chancellor … and her finance
       minister [Schäuble] loudly said ‘no way’ to those considerations
       back then,” he added.
       It's not the first time that the Social Democrats have tried to
       claim Macron as one of their own.
       When Macron made his first visit as president to Berlin, SPD
       Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel went to the airport to greet him
       personally — before the new French leader met with Merkel.
       Afterward, Gabriel's official Facebook page featured a picture of
       the welcome with the caption "Two old friends."
       So far, however, the SPD's efforts seem to have had little effect.
       National and international media coverage portrays Macron and
       Merkel as a pro-European, multilateralist duo moving forward on
       issues such as security, migration, and eurozone reform.
       “A magic dwells in each beginning,” Merkel quoted from German
       author Hermann Hesse at a press conference last month following her
       first meeting with President Macron, who’s known as a connoisseur
       of German literature.
       A few weeks later, a video showing Macron swerving away from Donald
       Trump to embrace Merkel at last moth's NATO summit in Brussels went
       viral in Germany.

2. Money talks
       If the SPD wants to present itself as the party that's willing to
       go deeper when it comes to European integration, it faces a
       challenge: most Germans are committed pro-Europeans but they are
       hesitant about paying out more money. The country is already one of
       the major net contributors to the EU budget.
       "In Germany, there is a sort of Pavlovian conditioning to say, 'No
       more money,' when we talk about EU finances," Schulz said on
       Thursday. But he quickly added that he was "not talking about
       [spending] more money."
       Anticipating attacks by his conservative rivals, Schulz stressed
       early in his campaign that as chancellor he would not necessarily
       change much about Germany’s insistence on debt reduction and
       structural reforms in crisis-ridden eurozone countries.

       European Parliament in Strasbourg | Frederick Florin/AFP via Getty
       Images
       But such statements mean the SPD still needs to explain exactly how
       it would act differently from Merkel.
       Schulz's strategy so far has been to stress reforms he would like
       to make to the EU budget. In other words, it's not about paying
       more for Europe, it's about focusing on how the money is spent.
       This, Schulz said, could involve coming up with a joint budget for
       the eurozone, as suggested by Macron — although the SPD leader
       added important caveats: "If the eurozone comes up with joint tasks
       in the labor market, in tax policy, in investment policy — joint
       tasks supported by all members of the eurozone."
       We're up for fundamental reforms, while Merkel's conservatives are
       primarily interested in preserving the status quo — that's the
       message the SPD will try to send.
       "To fight for a united Europe is and remains a matter close to my
       heart," Schulz said on Thursday at a meeting of the SPD's
       parliamentary group in the Bundestag.
       This passion, he added, was not something he recently discovered in
       a beer tent.

When going home is a death sentence

   Forcibly sending refugees back to an unsafe country violates
   international laws.

   KABUL, Afghanistan — The moment you step outside the airport in Kabul,
   Afghanistan, the first thing that strikes you are the roses. They are
   everywhere — lining the dusty motorway into town, clustering flowerbeds
   in traffic circles, blooming in private gardens.

   The second thing you see is fear. Foreigners hide behind their
   sandbagged walls, barbed wire, armed guards and bulletproof vehicles.
   But many locals are terrified too, including those who fled the country
   but were recently returned against their will.

   There is every reason to be afraid. The fragile government is
   struggling to make headway against the Taliban, which is likely more
   powerful now than at any time since 2001. Other armed opposition groups
   — including the so-called Islamic State — have seized control of parts
   of the country and carry out devastating attacks even in securitized
   areas of Kabul and elsewhere.

   Violent incidents are increasingly frequent. According to the U.N.,
   2016 was the deadliest year for civilian casualties since its records
   began in 2009. While my Amnesty International colleagues and I were in
   Kabul in May, a German aid worker and an Afghan guard were killed, and
   a Finnish woman likely kidnapped, during an attack on a Swedish NGO in
   the city. Wednesday’s horrific bomb attack near the German embassy in
   central Kabul shows that rather than winding down, the conflict in
   Afghanistan is escalating dangerously.

   British and American authorities warn their citizens against traveling
   to Afghanistan, saying it remains unsafe “due to the ongoing risk of
   kidnapping, hostage-taking, military combat operations, landmines,
   banditry, armed rivalry between political and tribal groups” and
   “insurgent attacks.”

     When Azad found out he was going to be deported, he tried to kill
     himself and was put under suicide watch until he was forcibly
     returned.

   And yet, Western governments have deemed the country safe enough for
   Afghan asylum seekers to return. Over the past decade and a half, a
   number of European countries (as well as Australia) have signed
   Memoranda of Understanding with Afghanistan, through which the country
   agrees to readmit its citizens under certain conditions. These types of
   arrangements are not necessarily unreasonable, but their implementation
   must conform with international law, which prohibits states from
   transferring people if there is a risk of serious human rights
   violations.

   Nonetheless, even as the situation in Afghanistan has unmistakably
   worsened, Western governments have escalated their efforts to return
   Afghans fleeing war and persecution.

Top German politician wants to deport ill migrants, Afghans
       Cynthia Kroet

   At an aid conference in October 2016, under pressure from the European
   Union, the Afghan government signed the EU-Afghanistan “Joint Way
   Forward,” a document that paves the way for the forcible return of an
   unlimited number of Afghans from Europe. One unnamed Afghan government
   official called the agreement a “poisoned cup” the country was forced
   to accept in return for development aid.

   Hundreds of returns have taken place since the agreement was signed six
   months ago. My colleagues and I recently spoke with Afghans deported
   from Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. While everyone in
   Afghanistan is at risk, many of the returnees we spoke to were
   extremely vulnerable, and their returns likely violated international
   law.

   A young man, whom I’ll call “Azad,” is at serious risk because of his
   sexual orientation. Afghanistan criminalizes same-sex sexual conduct,
   and there have been reports of harassment, violence and detention by
   police. When Azad found out he was going to be deported, he tried to
   kill himself and was put under suicide watch until he was forcibly
   returned.

   This was his first time in Kabul, he told me. “I have nowhere to go,”
   he said. “Maybe I will join the other drug addicts in the west of the
   city, just to get some shelter.”

   Despite his young age, Azad has survived a number of tragedies. After
   fleeing the war in Afghanistan as a child, he grew up in Iran, and
   later lost his mother when the family tried to make its way to Europe.
   While clearly frightened throughout our conversation, he broke down
   when speaking about her death. “All I want to do is visit her grave.”

   Another man, “Farid,” is in danger of religious persecution for
   converting to Christianity. Like Azad, he left Afghanistan as a child,
   grew up in Iran, then fled to a European country. He is terrified about
   what will happen to him in Afghanistan. Still in shock after being
   wrenched from his adopted country and faith community, he said: “I feel
   like I’ve fallen from the sky. I don’t believe I’m here.”

   He, too, had never been to Kabul. “I don’t know anything about
   Afghanistan,” he told me. “Where will I go? I don’t have funds to live
   alone and I can’t live with relatives because they will see that I
   don’t pray.”

   Their stories are, unfortunately, far from exceptional. Some deportees
   have already suffered violence after being forcibly returned to
   Afghanistan. An Afghan who returned from Germany in January was injured
   in a suicide attack near the Supreme Court just two weeks later,
   according to a recent report by the Afghan Analysts Network. Several
   other people — including young children — were injured in attacks by
   armed groups in Kabul, a member of the Afghanistan Migrants Advice and
   Support Organization told us.

   None of these people should have been sent back. When they walked out
   of the airport, the country was probably as unknown to many of them as
   it was to me — and they face far greater risks.

   European governments and leaders know Afghanistan is not safe. If they
   don’t stop deporting people like Azad and Farid, they will have blood
   on their hands.
