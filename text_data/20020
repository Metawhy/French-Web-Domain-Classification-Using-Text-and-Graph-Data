Free Kids Music MP3s From Top Indie (Kindie) Artists!

   Remember the popular Seventies hit song I’d Like To Teach The World To
   Sing by The Hillside Singers? Yep…the world-famous Coca-Cola commercial
   (you can find it on YouTube). Well, four members of the Hillside
   Singers have teamed up with a family friend to form Treehouse 10, and
   released Bug In A Puddle. They’re sharing two songs with us: Hippo Lake
   and The Man With 29 Cats.

   When Patricia Touma’s four children were growing up, instead of reading
   to them before bed, she made up stories about the adventures of
   siblings named Ish and Mish and their dog Jaime. She’s recently
   published these stories in a series of children’s books. And she’s also
   released an album called Happy Times, from which she’s sharing three
   songs with us: Riding On The Bus, The Merry-Go-Round and The Frost Is
   On The Pumpkin.

   The Luv Clowns from Memphis bill themselves as creating “riotous
   musical absurdities for children and the grown-ups who serve them”.
   From their album Love Clowns!, they are sharing: K-I-D-S

   The Plants are based in Philadephia, and bill their music as a blend of
   funk, folk, mo town, doo-wop, rock and more. From their first album,
   Sprouting Out, they are sharing the song If I Was A Fish.

   Kira Willey is a Bethlehem, Pennsylvania based teacher of yoga for kids
   as well as a fresh sound in creating music for kids. We’re pleased to
   be able to present two songs from her latest album: Mr. Cricket Hop and
   Roller Coaster.

   Paul Rogers has been the front man for the San Francisco-based
   accordion rock band Those Darn Accordions for 20 years, and he’s made a
   recent venture into kids music with an album called The Cul-de-Sac
   Kids, featuring two songs available right here: Sick Of Being Sick and
   Stop The Haircut.

                                 [INS: :INS]

   Silly Goose Songsters is a family-and-friends recording project based
   in California. They’ve recently released an album called Songs For
   Silly Geese, and are sharing two songs with us: Animal Sounds and
   Chugga Chugga Chu Chu.

   Debbie and Friends have been a part of our site for a number of years
   now. But they are back to share some more tunes with you. Check out So,
   So Happy and Willy Won’t Smile For The Camera…and that song’s great
   animated video which we’ve posted on the same page!

   Andrew Queen is a talented Canadian singer and songwriter who is
   sharing his “country-fied” outdoor song I Love Boating.

   Amy Michelle is a songwriter and published children’s book illustrator
   and author. She’s sharing two songs: Can’t Find My Shoes and Shine!
   Shine! Shine!

   Brett Campbell hails from Queensland, Australia who’s brought us two
   songs to share with you: Dinosaurs and Duck Duck Frog

   Candy Band is four moms from Detroit who really love to rock! Enjoy
   their high-energy, punked-up song Ice Cream!

   Elizabeth Mitchell is a folkie who regularly performs with her husband
   and young daughter, and occasionally with luminaries from the worlds of
   childrens music and mainstream rock. The young and the young-at-heart
   will appreciate the song Oh, John The Rabbit (and the accompanying
   video as well).

   Judi Cranston is the founder of kindyRock. The New Zealand-based
   writer/producer tackles development language skills, math concepts,
   creativity, gross and fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination and
   social skills. She’s brought us Zippity Zap to share with you.

                                 [INS: :INS]

   Meredith Wright is the heartbeat behind Sweetbeatz. The NYC-based
   artist, vocalist and early childhood teacher offers up her musical take
   on Laundry.

   KidsLive is based in Pennsylvania and is sharing the title song from
   their album The Great Big Person.

   Gogo Bonkers! is a Canadian duo who bring a mega-dose of energy and
   creativity to their passion for promoting environmental sustainability.
   They are sharing two songs: Big Cloud and Walking In The Forest.

   Kansas based singer/songwriter Randy Sauer brings Randy’s Music Jam
   (his fun and interactive live show) to area malls and town festivals.
   He’s offering up a musical invite to take a dip in Milkshake Lake!

   Rick Scott returns to our site with his energetic entertainment. The
   veteran of 17 albums is sharing two songs: Elephant Ride and Sneakers

   Berklee College of Music grad Wayne Potash is ready to tempt you with
   his culinary creation Ready For Dinner.

   New Jersey-based Yosi & The Superdads put up a *strong* argument that
   they are the hardest-working band in show business with…450
   high-energy, humorous children’s shows a year! What do all those
   audiences know that you may be missing? Check out Wake Up!

   Despite its sparse production, we really enjoyed the song by Shelley
   called Cowboys, Cowgirls. Double bonus for the imagery of kids walking
   into a saloon and order, “Double milk – no ice, thank you”. Yee-haw!

   Alan W. Lemke is a Colorado-based singer/songwriter, and he’s asking
   the kind of music question you’re likely to hear almost every day on
   any street corner: Have You Ever Seen An Alligator Surfin’?
