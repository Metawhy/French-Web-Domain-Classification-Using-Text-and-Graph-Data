   Good destination for a short city trip. The town in not too big,
   without a car you can get around the sights in 2 to 3 days maximum.
   Also a good place to start a visit to the French Pyrenees.

   Wonderful medieval town center. Toulouse is known as the pink city
   thanks to the color of the brick walls of much of its historic center
   as the sun sets. Toulouse has several beautiful Romanesque churches,
   and is a fun city to go an explore. Toulouse is also home to Airbus,
   which gives it an unique blend of the old and new.

   La Ville Rose, the historic and cultural capital of southern France and
   Occitania, is a beautiful city full of history and warm-hearted people.
   It seems the closer you get to the Mediterranean, the warmer the
   people- and so it is here. I was studying French, Spanish and Arabic
   when I lived here and found this city a perfect confluence of the three
   cultures, plus a vibrant Occitanian culture you don't want to miss out
   on!

   The fourth-largest city in France and capital of the Midi-Pyrénées
   region is a criminally overlooked destination when it comes to
   international tourism. It is a rich city that has found a way to
   preserve its medieval past, the center of the European aerospace
   industry (Airbus HQ is here), a hub of culture, a young and vibrant
   university town, home to the very distinctive Sud-Ouest cuisine, the
   gateway to the Pyrénées mountains as well as the sandy dunes of the
   French Basque region on the Atlantic and the windsurfing hotbeds of the
   Languedoc-Roussillon on the Mediterranean, due to its central location
   in southwestern France. Its immediate area is dotted with mountain
   gorges and charming, medieval towns like Castres and Carcassone.
   Perhaps not a must-stop on your first visit to France, but if you've
   already done the essential France and are looking for a more out of the
   ordinary destination, I can hardly think of a better place to spend a
   holiday than 'dans La Ville Rose' - in the Pink City of Toulouse.
