   May 8, 2019 — Leaflet 1.5.1 has been released!

   Leaflet is the leading open-source JavaScript library for
   mobile-friendly interactive maps. Weighing just about 38 KB of JS,
   it has all the mapping features most developers ever need.

   Leaflet is designed with simplicity, performance and usability in mind.
   It works efficiently across all major desktop and mobile platforms, can
   be extended with lots of plugins, has a beautiful, easy to use and
   well-documented API and a simple, readable source code that is a joy to
   contribute to.

   Here we create a map in the 'map' div, add tiles of our choice, and
   then add a marker with some text in a popup:
var map = L.map('map').setView([51.505, -0.09], 13);

L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
    attribution: '&copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenS
treetMap</a> contributors'
}).addTo(map);

L.marker([51.5, -0.09]).addTo(map)
    .bindPopup('A pretty CSS3 popup.<br> Easily customizable.')
    .openPopup();

   Learn more with the quick start guide, check out other tutorials, or
   head straight to the API documentation. If you have any questions, take
   a look at the FAQ first.
