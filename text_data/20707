Plum Recommending Replacement of Binding Top Plate Screws

   by Lou Dawson May 17, 2013
   written by Lou Dawson May 17, 2013

   I just heard from the Plum ski binding rep for North America. He says
   there have been some durability problems with the top plate screws (see
   photos below) in late model 2012/2013 (sold in North America Nov. 1,
   2012 to Jan. 10, 2013) Plum bindings. Some of our readers alluded to
   this in previous Plum blog post comments.

   To remedy this, Plum is not doing a recall but rather providing
   replacement top plate screws free of charge. The replacement process is
   simple.

   Backstory reported to WildSnow is reports of these screws failing
   eventually reached Plum in France. They quickly researched the issue
   and found a batch of T8 screws for the heel top plate came from a parts
   supplier that were found to not meet PLUM spec. Wildsnow learned that
   this top plate screw batch only affects production from November 1st
   2012 to January 10th 2013. Models affected are Plum Guide, Plum Yak and
   Plum “J’Envoie du Gros. No past product prior to that date is affected.
   We’re not sure exactly how the bindings are to be identified, but
   apparently here in North America they were only available through
   dealers. So perhaps knowing the date you acquired them is enough. If in
   doubt, the screws are very easy to replace. (Plum bindings have serial
   numbers stamped on the bottom, but you have to remove the binding from
   the ski to see it).

     According to Plum in France: Customer safety is our primary concern.
     As a measure of precaution we are providing a global screw batch
     replacement by another batch with stricter quality requirements,
     with free of charge replacement of the screws for the models
     mentioned above.

   The replacement process is easy, but as always here at WildSnow.com we
   recommend having a ski shop tech do it if you’re light on your hand
   skills. The new screws have a phillips head, the old ones are torx 8.
   First step is back off the lateral RV (release value) screw to a low
   setting so the top plate doesn’t get pushed off by internal spring
   tension as you remove the screws. The use your t8 torx driver to remove
   each screw one at a time, replacing it with the new updated Phillips
   head. Do not over tighten the phillips head screws, just nice and snug.
   Replacing Plum top plate screws. Experienced mechanics can do it in a
   few minutes.

   few minutes.

     From Plum North America (lightly edited): “We wanted to let WildSnow
     know we just received a batch of replacement screws which we will be
     sending out to our dealers in North America. Please remember these
     screws are only necessary for bindings sold during November 1 to
     January 10 2013. For customers in North America these bindings where
     only sold through Apex Mountain Products certified dealers listed on
     our web site, www.apexmountainproducts.com. We will send those
     dealers replacement screws for customers that purchased equipment
     from them. If a consumer purchased a set of PLUM bindings noted
     above we recommend contacting the dealer where they purchased the
     product from for free replacement screws. Any other questions in
     North America regarding PLUM bindings, please use the contact link
     at Apex Mountain Products.

     If you are a PLUM customer in Europe please contact PLUM service at
     +33 450 345 867 or use the contact option on the Plum Website.

   Thanks for posting this. I was one of the unlucky ones to receive a
   binding with the weak screws. Had one break in half inside the heel
   unit and a heel pin also became loose on the same unit, not sure if
   they’re related. Thanks to the guys at Cripple Creek for swapping me
   out with a new heel unit. I thought this was just a random failure, now
   I know it’s more than that! Thanks Lou!

   I got my Guides directly from the plum website (it only took them two
   days to ship to Australia, and were much cheaper than buying Dynafit
   bindings over here) – they sent me the screws directly about a month
   ago.

   I have a pair of K2 Brightside 160 cm ski that I have been using for
   telemark in the northeast. I want to change them to AT so I removed the
   binding, no issues. I looked for the mid sole point and the graphics
   are worn. Any way you can help me. I can see part of the words and the
   K2 triangle. I like a slow controlled skiing (trees) but do ski lots
   (150 day per year) with about half in the BC. We have the equipment to
   mount the bindings.

   Lou Dawson May 20, 2013 - 9:31 am

   I’d just dummy up a tele binding toe on the ski, stick a boot in it,
   and mark on the ski where the midpoint of the tele boot ends up, use
   the same position. This assuming you were able to ski the skis parallel
   style and they felt ok. K2 customer service also has this info, but
   it’s sometimes hard to dredge up. Lou

   thanks to this post, i got some replacement screws from plum.

   unfortunately i have a screw that’s sheared off – the top part with
   head is gone and the bottom part is stuck in the heel base.

   any advice how to get the broken bottom part out? is this something
   that requires a replacement?

   many thanks in advance for any advice.

   Peter J January 7, 2014 - 11:15 pm

   Does anyone know the serial number range of the bindings with the top
   plate screw problem?

   I bought a set of Plums this fall, privately on eBay (new in box). I
   made note of the serial number before having them mounted. As I didn’t
   buy them from a dealer, I can’t readily deteremine the date of
   manufacture, or ask a dealer for replacement screws.

   Plum’s web site provides no information on this issue. I suppose I
   could e-mail them and ask …

   Thanks …

   louis dawson January 8, 2014 - 12:55 am

   Peter, my advice is if in doubt replace the screws.

Alpin Magazine Ski Reviews 2012/2013 — 95mm +

   by TheEditors OfWildsnow August 23, 2013
   written by TheEditors OfWildsnow August 23, 2013

     Editor’s note:

     Bringing this post up to the top page today. Looking for deals on
     skis? Check out Alpin Magazine’s wide board review from last winter
     and browse the shopping links.

     Germany based Alpin does one of the best overview ski tests out
     there, with permission from Alpin Magazine we offer this translation
     and online presentation. (See German version here.)

     Thanks David Gerrard for the translation work. It’s interesting to
     see that while Alpin has three general verbal ratings for skis
     (Satisfactory, Good, Very Good) very few of the skis in the this
     wider category were rated less than Good. Note that some companies
     choose not to provide Alpin with test skis–as always a scold from
     WildSnow for those companies not stepping up. Also, Alpin does
     review narrower skis. After all, this is European! We’ll cover the
     skinny planks briefly at the bottom of this post, and in another
     blog post. Nearly all these skis are available via etail; we provide
     shopping links where we can. We’re noticing excellent prices on many
     of these skis — might be a good time to pick up another arrow for
     your quiver. Please know the shopping links are added by us here at
     WildSnow The Backcountry Skiing Blog and were not part of the
     original printed review.

   Alpin Review follows, translated from German:
   This year (2013) everything wider than 95mm underfoot has been classed
   as a “Free-Touring Ski.” Up to now we have used the classifications of
   the manufacturer, but strict categories are now ever more blurred, so
   we’ve updated our usual method of classification. We’ve also adapted
   our terminology with the times: no longer are these skis the “touring
   suitable Freeride skis,” but “Free-touring” skis.” At last we’ve got
   the ski we’ve been waiting years for” was often the reaction this
   season. Not that skis used to be poor, but for our target group: skiers
   and ski-tourers who not only take the lift, but also ascend under their
   own steam; the modern, wide skis are a blessing.

   There are more skis on offer, the skis are more varied and there’s a
   greater choice. There’s also a new trend in rocker-technology, itself
   now well established in powder-ski design, the inverted waist. Here the
   widest part of the ski is set noticeably further back from the tip to
   where the ski makes first real contact with the surface of the snow.
   With a rockered ski, this contact point is far further back than usual.
   Of course not every ski needs this type of design and there are good
   skis with other geometries, but it’s an evolution in ski-design which
   is likely to stay with us for some time.

   Amongst the Free-Tourers the Dynastar High Mountain Cham 97 has the
   same construction as its smaller brother: the Cham 87, which took the
   title in the category ”Touring-Skis (narrower boards)” against some
   stiff competition. That a design can perform superbly at a certain
   width, but doesn’t translate to wider skis was demonstrated several
   times in this test. It’s true for the Cham 97, which scores well but
   not as good as its narrower counterpart and it’s also true for the
   Kaestle models TX97 and TX107. Here too, the smallest sibling, the
   TX87, performed brilliantly (last year it was the Test Winner!),
   creating a lot of expectation for the fatter models, which
   unfortunately wasn’t realized.

   Wide skis can become quickly unstable and nervous if they don’t reach a
   critical minimum weight. A similar fate as the Kaestle-models befell a
   few other “lightweight” competitors: the Ski-Logik Yeti and Trab Volare
   are wide and light, and struggle in any other conditions than pure
   powder. The Voelkl Nanuq is perhaps not a super-lightweight ski
   anymore, but has superb performance for its weight (2995g / 170cm). For
   this it was given our “Lightweight-Tip” award.

   So, just how light can a Free-Tourer ski be? Naturally the sky’s the
   limit: it all depends upon the skier’s individual requirements and
   preferences. Similarly the Voelkl Nunataq (3565g / 178cm) offers
   spectacular fun at a fully acceptable weight, far below four kilos.
   It’s not just a ski for off-piste, as you can quite happily spend half
   a day on the piste as long as the conditions are not too hard or icy.
   Off the piste the Nunataq will take anything you throw at it: fast or
   slow, tracked or fresh, short swings or long, open turns. With a
   perfectly acceptable weight, its superb performance earned the ski the
   title of Test Winner.

   In certain situations the Diplomat from Mountain Wave proved somewhat
   stronger than the Nunataq: the ski isn’t as skittish as some of its
   narrower brothers, but nicely responsive. Its strength was clearly
   tracked snow, but it was fun to ski in nearly all snow conditions,
   which is why it was the favorite ski for many testers. Diplomat was
   just too heavy to take the main prize, as it easily exceeded the four
   kilo limit, but still earned our Tip for Downhill Performance. The
   Carbon Megawatt from Black Diamond brought a broad smile to all our
   testers’ faces, at least as long as the terrain was open and snow and
   visibility were good. Good visibility is a prerequisite for this ski,
   as you’re inclined to find yourself traveling at surprising speed.

   Summary
   The Free-Touring skis have become wider and lighter, which is a tricky
   compromise, as it can quickly result in a ski which is only really any
   good in powder. The Voelkl Nanuq is a relatively light ski in our
   group, which still delivers a lot of fun. The heaviest ski in the test,
   the Mountain Wave Diplomat, is a terrific ski and is fun to ski even
   when snow conditions are far from optimal, but our Test Winner, the
   Voelkl Nunataq, was gifted with a superb compromise between downhill
   performance and acceptable weight: fat, but not too heavy, a ski with
   which you can still clock up 1000m of ascent in a day.

     Editor’s note: Capsule reviews follow, translated from the image
     above. The double numbers after the name are the Alpin weight index.
     The larger the number, the heavier the ski per unit surface area, or
     something like that anyway.

   Skilogik Yeti
   17,3
   (+)Light
   (-)Unstable
   (-) Poor grip on ice
   With 105mm under the binding and a weight of only 3170g (183cm) the
   Yeti is light. Good when you want to ascend 2000m in top conditions.
   Otherwise the Yeti is rather unstable.
   138 – 105 – 124
   Satisfactory
   Shop for Skilogic skis.

   Black Diamond Drift
   17,5
   (+) Very good in powder
   (+) Light
   (-) Unstable on the piste
   The Drift is very good in powder, no wonder with those dimensions, but
   even the Drift shows weaknesses on hard or deep chopped-up snow.
   Off-piste the Drift is easy to control.
   136 – 100 – 122
   Good
   Shop for Black Diamond Drift

   Ski Trab Volare
   17,5
   (+) Light
   (+) top finish
   (-) poor grip
   A ski from Trab with almost 100mm under the binding – not bad! Ski Trab
   is more a specialist for light racing or touring skis. The Volare is
   good in powder, but shows weaknesses on hard snow. Very good finish!
   129 – 99 – 116
   Satisfactory
   Shop for Trab Volare

   Völkl Nanuq
   ALPIN Weight Tip!
   17,6
   (+) Stable at speed
   (+) Relatively light
   (+) Responsive
   The Nanuq is an old friend – which doesn’t make it any poorer. With not
   even 3kg at 170cm the ski is light, but still convinces with good,
   well-balanced skiing-characteristics.
   131 – 96 – 114
   Good
   It’s pretty funny seeing Backcountry.com call this a “telemark ski.”
   Whatever the case, here is the link.

   Elan Himalaya
   17,9
   (+) Responsive
   (-) somewhat unstable or nervous
   We’ve never tested a ski with such a soft tip. It’s strengths are seen
   in powder, in other snow types the ski proves to be well balanced and
   responsive.
   125 – 96 – 98
   Good
   Head over to the Elan Website, where Plake will give you his sales
   pitch.

   La Sportiva Lo 5
   18,2
   The Lo 5 from La Sportiva is a ski with character. For a Free-Tourer
   the ski is still relatively light, but still manages to be stable. The
   ski is easy to maneuver, especially in powder or flat terrain.
   125 – 95 – 115
   Good
   Available online.

   Kästle TX97
   18,7
   The TX97 from Kästle is an identical construction to the TX87, only
   10mm wider. The TX97 doesn’t convince to the same degree that one would
   expect from the TX87. Has no particular weaknesses, or strengths.
   128 – 97 – 117
   Good
   Shop for it.

   Dynastar High Mountain Cham 97
   18,9
   The Cham High Mountain 97 is the big brother of the Cham High Mountain
   87, which was top in the Tour-Ski test for narrower skis. On piste the
   ski is agile, but becomes quickly unstable at higher speeds.
   133 – 97 – 113
   Good
   If you insist, it’s available at Backcountry.com.

   Atomic Drifter
   19,7
   The Drifter certainly doesn’t honour its name, as one doesn’t have to
   drift the ski at all. This rather stable ski takes its turns (if you
   want to make them) cleanly on its edges. In powder this rockered ski is
   convincing.
   132 – 95 – 121
   Good
   We’re not sure where to get this online, check here.

   Kästle TX107
   19,8
   (+) good in powder
   (-) weakness on the piste
   The TX107 also has its construction based on the TX87: but it shows
   that although one ski in the range comes out top, it doesn’t have to
   hold true for the other models. Because of its width the TX107 is
   especially convincing in powder.
   135 – 107 – 127
   Good
   Take a look.

   Völkl Nunataq — TEST WINNER!!
   20
   (+) top skiing characteristics
   (+) still light
   The Nunataq from Völkl shows no weaknesses, neither in its statistics
   (weight, dimensions etc) or its inner qualities. Whether flat or steep,
   powder or tracked: nothing worries the Nunataq. —
   139 – 107 – 123
   Very good
   Shop for Volkl Nunataq

   Blizzard Kabookie
   20,1
   (+) stable
   (+) good in difficult conditions
   (-) somewhat unbalanced
   The Kabookie from Blizzard shows definite strengths: it is especially
   strong in tracked snow. On the other hand, it’s not particularly light.
   For this weight it could have shown more stability on the piste.
   131 – 98 – 116
   Good
   Check out Blizzard Kabookie

   Scott Powd’Air
   20,4
   (+) in powder well balanced
   (-) unstable for the weight
   (-) expensive
   The Powd’Air is an old acquaintance, it’s already been tested a couple
   of times. A couple of years ago it was unique, now less so. This year
   the Scott proves to be be good and well balanced.
   134 – 100 – 123
   Good
   Find a Scott dealer.

   Kessler Odysee
   21,2
   (+) well balanced
   (-) expensive
   The Odysee from Kessler is an exotic addition to the selection. The
   exclusiveness is reflected in the price (MSRP $1,799). Its
   characteristics make the ski fun, but it doesn’t bowl you over. Well
   balanced, with no particular strengths or weaknesses.
   132 – 98 – 122
   Good
   If you have this kind of money for an average ski, we’re sure you can
   find a shopping source.

   K2 Backdrop
   21,3
   (+) Very stable
   (+) Good in tracked snow
   (-) Somewhat sluggish
   The K2 Backdrop at 118mm is pretty wide. Considering this it proved to
   have good grip and stable at speed. Whoever’s looking for a really wide
   Free-Tourer – here it is!
   142 – 112 – 131 (note, these are the K2 published dimensisons, number
   in graphic above appears to be a typo)
   Very Good
   Shop for K2 Backdrop

   Black Diamond Carbon Megawatt
   22,6
   (+) invincible in powder
   (+) relatively stable
   (-) average edge grip
   The widest ski in the test was the Carbon Megawatt. Whenever we left
   the piste a smile appeared on the face of the tester. That the smile
   disappeared when conditions became firmer is also clear.
   153 – 125 – 131
   Good
   Shop for Megawatt

   Mountain Wave Diplomat
   ALPIN Downhill Tip!
   23,6
   (+) relatively stable
   (+) very well balanced
   (-) relatively heavy
   The Diplomat from Mountain Wave convinced both the male and the female
   testers. It’s well-balanced, makes controlled turns, even in tracked
   snow and is also good on the piste.
   140 – 104 – 128
   Very Good
   Not sure where to shop for this, suggestions welcome.

     Editor’s note: As promised, what skis won Alpin’s extensive touring
     ski review (planks at 93 mm or less at the waist)?

     See the complete Alpine sub-93 skis review for 2012=13 here.

     Overall sub-93 winners go to K2 Backup (124/82/105) for their
     narrower class, and Dynastar Cham (127/87/103) for their
     wider/narrow touring class. Honrable mention for the do-everything
     ski again goes to K2 for the venerable Wayback, a ski with lots of
     fans around WildSnow HQ. For a wider do-it-all, Kastle 87 got the
     honors. Black Diamond gets kudos for their women’s specific Crescent
     model. If you’re looking for new skis, you can not go wrong with any
     of these if they fit your needs in terms of gender, weight and
     dimensions. We’re working on presenting the review of the narrower
     skis. More planks, so somewhat more involved.

     In terms of shopping, the K2 Backup will not be part of the K2
     lineup in 2014 and it’s on some deep discounts. For example, check
     out this K2 Backup deal at GearX.

     Shop Backcountry.com for the now famous Dynastar Cham 87, and
     they’ve also got Kastle skis as well as Wayback and BD Crescent.

   Anyone care to compare the DPS 112 Wailer with the Vokl Nunatak?
   Looking for mostly a resort ski, with only about 15% off piste.
   Lou Dawson February 21, 2013 - 10:35 am

   John, I have the K2 catalog right here, 2013/14, no more Backup. That’s
   one reason the ski is easy to find on a deal. It’s an excellent ski and
   is current for this model year, 2012/13. We will not know what the real
   replacement is, if any, until they are actually tested on-snow. Lou

   Rob S February 21, 2013 - 10:55 am

   Scott – the DPS 112 is an amazingly fun ski in powder, but if you are
   only planning to spend 15% of time off piste, it’s not the ski I’d
   focus on. They can be fun on groomers as they are very, very agile, but
   they are a bit sketchy if it’s the least bit icy….with all that rocker,
   you just don’t have as much edge underfoot. Can’t speak to the Nunatuk,
   I’m afraid.

   John Iltis February 21, 2013 - 12:07 pm

   Yup, you’re right. It looks like the link is to 13/14 k2 euro catalog.
   And if that catalog is to be believed, In addition to keeping the
   backup, the euro’s get a new ski in the Backlite: 118/74/103 @ 1150gr.

   Phil Miller February 21, 2013 - 2:06 pm

   I just got a 2012 K2 Backup from evo.com for 150 bucks a couple of
   weeks ago. Skied on ’em last Monday for the first time. Great skis!
   They will definitely be my go to spring skis. The 2012 has rocker,
   previous years do not. They had really good deals on Shuksan’s too if
   someone isn’t all that crazy about width.
   I like a little width, but for California skier who does more than half
   of my skiing on spring snow, 90 is about all I can use, and having to
   beef up boots to handle wider skis, and beefier tele bindings to handle
   the beefier boots and bindings, and… it just all spirals out of control
   to solve a problem I don’t have. And I’m light enough that I floated
   pretty easily on 70mm underfoot, if they were long enough.

   Tim K February 21, 2013 - 2:56 pm

   That Evo deal is done.. scored a set for the g-friend(on Lou’s
   recommendation) … she loves her’s (shorter) I tried to get a set and
   the were back up to a real #….

   Lou Dawson February 21, 2013 - 3:37 pm

   Phil, you have to be kidding! That is incredible. Good shopping chops
   there guy.

   Bill February 21, 2013 - 3:40 pm

   @ Scott,
   The Nunataq is very fun inside the resort, it can carve a wide fast one
   and did have pretty good edge hold (at least when it still had a tune
   the first week or so they were out of the box, I’m lazy on taking care
   of edges). Because its soft and has a very low profile rocker (looks
   almost flat) you can intentionally wash it out really easily at high
   speed and move from a long to short-radius turn in a very short
   distance. Quick enough in the trees, not particularly fun in the bumps,
   fine enough all around but probably not as fun on-piste as some other
   narrower models with traditional tails but some early rise like many
   K2s currently feature. I’m light (130lbs) and ski the 177, its plenty
   stable in crud for me, but because its so soft (compared to for
   instance, the regular Volkl Gotama) maybe a heavier skier would disagre
   on stability? Overall, I think its a great ski and enjoy skiing it on
   inside-the-rope days just fine

   Tom Gos February 21, 2013 - 4:41 pm

   Lou, do you know if this is the complete group of skis that Alpin
   tested in these categories, or if these are only the mostly highly
   ranked? There are some skis I’m surprised not to see here such as the
   Dynastar Cham HM 107, just wondering if they didn’t like these skis or
   didn’t test them.

   Lou Dawson February 21, 2013 - 5:35 pm

   Tom, Olaf (editor) told me some time ago that indeed they only publish
   the best. Also, some companies don’t choose to supply skis, or a given
   ski is not available at the time. This sort of ski review will never
   include everything, it’s sort of an extended version of our Ultimate
   Quiver review. If you’re convinced a ski is good, and it gets good
   reviews elsewhere, I wouldn’t be concerned about whether Alpin covers
   it or not. We think Alpin completely tests a broad enough base of skis
   to be valid, which is why we publish.

   Others will notice no DPS, no Dynafit, etc.

   Olaf told me one reason some companies don’t supply skis is they don’t
   like the way Alpin picks just a few overall winners. We quite like
   that, so we do everything we can to support Olaf and Alpin.

   Lou Dawson February 21, 2013 - 6:59 pm

   P.S., as we keep getting accusations of being Dynafit biased, naysayers
   might note the we just published a ski review with no Dynafit skis
   (sadly, I might add with a grin).

   Mark Worley February 21, 2013 - 9:31 pm

   Weird, as the did include some odd ski that retails for $1700 dollars.

   Lou Dawson February 22, 2013 - 5:23 am

   Could have been they wanted to show how paying a ton of money doesn’t
   necessarily result in an exceptional ski, just an empty wallet.

   coastranger February 22, 2013 - 7:13 am

   K2 Backdrop 142/112/131 NOT 142/118?/ 131 like the review says. Come on
   guys get it right if you are gonna right a review. I have lots of miles
   on mine and am very pleased with it in all conditions. I dont find the
   ski sluggish like the review says at all. K2 is not changing a thing
   for this ski for 2014.

   Lou Dawson February 22, 2013 - 8:39 am

   Coast, thanks, we indeed try to get it right, with your help that’s
   possible. Looks like that was just a typo in the Alpin graphic. I can’t
   fix there but will do so in the text if it needs it. Lou

   Dave February 22, 2013 - 9:37 am

   Mountain Wave skis available in Deutschland and the UK.
   (http://www.skylotec-sports.com/freerideski)

   I’m liking the “Personal Jesus” model.

   JonM February 22, 2013 - 10:20 am

   Always enjoy Alpin’s reviews. Thanks Lou.
   Some comparison data is very handy such as ski performance in difficult
   conditions, edging, turn size, steep slopes, etc…

   Some data is humorous such as suitability for distance touring. The
   TX97 only gets one star and the fat/heavy Carbon Megawatt beats it.
   Hmm.
   Of course I think using tech bindings would improve the distance
   touring capability of any of those skis rather than using the bindings
   pictured.

   Translation fix regarding the Himalaya: They have never tested a ski
   with a tip that yields (soft) ever before, not ‘broad’ .

   David Gerrard February 23, 2013 - 4:57 am

   @JonM
   Quite right re translation, guilty as charged. 20 lashes administered,
   miscreant obliged to ascend his next 1000m of vertical with skins
   attached in reverse. Recent purchase of varifocal spectacles remedy for
   future incidents. Apologies to all seeking a ski with the broadest tip
   out there.

   Lou Dawson February 23, 2013 - 7:34 am

   I edited the translation. Thanks Jon and David!!!

   Matt Kinney February 23, 2013 - 11:15 am

   Beating up my second pair of BD Drifts so am glad to see it very high
   on the above list. I’m on the new “cam0” colored top sheet 2013
   version. I think the skis dimensions are perfect. Not to much,not too
   little. I really enjoy reading this review sheet. Thanks lou. It shows
   some skis may be overrated or hyped on the US side of the ocean.
   I am so amazed with the ski in powder.

   BTW the Drift handles the hard pack ok as long as you got one foot
   forward. 🙂

   PeteH February 24, 2013 - 10:06 am

   I’ve been skiing the Nunataq as my powder / all-around touring ski this
   year and have been happy with them. I wouldn’t say they are soft at
   all, they just have very minimal camber.

   I recently ordered a pair of Nanuqs as my spring / summer / mountain
   ski. I waffled between these and the Elan Himalayas but was eventually
   scared off the Himalayas because of the ridiculously soft tip. The
   review appears flawed though in citing the Himalaya as having a higher
   weight index as the Nanuq or Drift. The Himalaya is incredibly light –
   under 7 lbs in the 184.

   Lou Dawson February 24, 2013 - 11:33 am

   Pete, thanks for chiming in. I was on the Nunataq yesterday for a few
   test runs at resort (chopped up powder and some groom). They continue
   to amaze, perhaps the most “natural” ski for my own technique I’ve been
   on in a while. In other words, I didn’t find myself adjusting my
   technique for the ski. Everyone is different, so shopper beware, but
   they’re sure still worth looking at and I’m totally not surprised at
   their top spot in the review.

   I’m not clear on how Alpin does their weight index, it’s probably just
   a general guideline.

   Lou

   msulkers February 24, 2013 - 11:51 pm

   Matt, I find this year’s Drift handles our hard pack very well and was
   surprised that it was panned for hard snow performance. It isn’t a
   stable at high speed ski, but I find it carves very well on piste.
   Certainly shines in the soft stuff, however.

   Dan February 25, 2013 - 9:24 am

   Nunataqs: For anyone thinking about purchasing a pair of Nunataqs, or
   for those skiers who have yet to check out any of the “fatter” skis for
   touring, I first tried the Nunataqs in Dec. on deep N. Cascades powder.
   My Aspects, which I love, simply could not handle those conditions. I
   have shied away from the fatter skis because of the weight. However,
   after those first 6 turns or so (it was very deep, moderately steep and
   a little drier than our typically relatively high moisture POW) I
   stopped to watch my partner, who was behind me on her DPS 112 Wailers
   for the first time in such conditions. All either of us could manage to
   get out of our mouths was “Holy S—t”. Briefly, except for long tours,
   the Aspects have been relegated to second position. A couple more
   points: We both thought that breaking trail was noticeably easier with
   the Nunataqs and the Wailers than with the Aspects (we both ski the
   Aspects) in spite of the extra weight. However, when skinning on an
   existing skin track, we both agree that the extra weight is noticeable.
   Also, we ski in trees a lot and we thought the Nunataqs and Wailers are
   every bit as nimble as the Aspects, at least in soft snow conditions.
   Additionally, we frequently ski the Whistler back-country. Those days
   can be long tours and I dread skiing out on the long, hard, usually icy
   cat track and Olympic run (green)…my knees hurt, I’m tired and
   generally it is dark or near dark. While the Nunataqs and Wailers do
   not turn that ski-out into fresh roy joy, they most definitely make it
   easier and more pleaseant. For reference, skiing skill-wise, we are
   both basic middle-of-the-pack back-country skiers. In an effort to
   compensate for the extra weight, lately I have been skiing the Nunataqs
   in my TLT5s and that combo seems to work fine. Although, my feet are
   warmer in the Dynafit ONEs. One last item. I was offered the Nunataqs
   at a very low price. I did not want them and I thought that i did not
   need them. Still, at $350…So, thanks to the Wildsnow Nunataq review,
   which I usually take with a grain of salt because the usual Wildsnow
   ski testers are folks that could probably ski with rock shoes
   duct-taped to barrel staves, I bought those suckers and have been
   smiling every time I ski them.

   Looking forward to part two, the 95mm – reviews.

   Lou Dawson February 25, 2013 - 2:03 pm

   Some of the WildSnow testers are indeed pretty good skiers. Me, I do ok
   when I’m on it but past my prime so I make a good tester for the
   everyman. This year’s Ultimate Quiver will be even more refined, but
   one thing for sure is the Nunataq will be in there since it will be
   retailed next winter. Lou

   K2 Back drop is an awesome ski, I love mine!!

   Lou Dawson February 26, 2013 - 5:33 pm

   I heard from a K2 spokesperson about the mystery of the Back Up ski.

   “The Back Up (Backup) is only going to be offered in the European
   distribution for 13/14, not the US.”

   Backdrop is in the 2013-14 North America catalog.

   So, if you Backup and you’re somewhere other than Europe, it’ll be time
   for Telemark Pyrenees.

   Mini ski review from reader Chase Harrison

   A few days ago I skied on the BD Warrant (130/95/118) in nine inches of
   powder. I know this ski probably falls into Alpin’s narrower ski
   category (please bring us your translation of that). But with a monster
   shovel and no rocker, this ski is incredibly versatile. I have been
   skiing on both the Kilowatt and Verdict for the past several years — my
   take is the Warrant is the Kilowatt on steroids. The other thing I
   liked about this ski is with the more defined side cut you have better
   edge control, it holds really well on hard snow and it has a tighter
   turning radius. I don’t think I would totally give up my Verdicts for
   touring but with the bigger shovel this ski could handle any thing the
   side country or back country can dish out. If I can come up with a
   pair, it’ll probably be the top ski in my quiver.

   jonah August 20, 2013 - 9:14 pm

   Hi Lou,
   i’m looking for a pair of rando race skis this season. i am not a
   racer. but have been on race gear multiple times. i really like the ski
   trab world cup.
   but with all the choices, and not being in the know with the race
   circles. would you please suggest a few brands? i would greatly
   appreciate it. thank you for your time

   TimZ August 27, 2013 - 9:55 am

   All due respect for Lou, et al, you might find a better answer over at
   skintrack.com
   Look here: http://www.skintrack.com/skis-comparison/

   Lou Dawson August 27, 2013 - 11:30 am

   Jonah, with all due respect to those who would point to our betters
   (grin), I’d say you can’t go wrong looking at Trab or Voile for
   “citizen” skimo race skis. Lou

   Ty Sorensen August 28, 2013 - 10:33 am

   Great conversations going on and an even better concise review. We
   constantly have the age old discussion of weight vs. performance.
   Personally for me, I am young and in great shape so I will carry a
   heavier ski for increased performance. Where as some value the weight
   savings that allow for conserved energy for the ride down. It all comes
   down to personal preferences. I would like to see twin rocker skis
   thrown into the category for free-touring like the Armada JJ or Line
   Sir Francis Bacon for example. they are much heavier than a traditional
   touring ski but allow a skier to hit much bigger lines and stomp bigger
   landings, even switch. This type of ski allows you to butter and slash
   through turns like you’re riding a wave, which is an emerging trend and
   style for younger skiers. So, just some more to chew on and I guess
   like I said in the beginning that it all boils down to user preference
   and riding style. It will be interesting to see where free-touring goes
   in the next 10 years. Thanks!

   Lou Dawson August 28, 2013 - 10:46 am

   Ty, your point is well taken, but some skis are lighter and perform
   just as well as equivalent brands/models that are heavier. There is no
   reason to always equate weight with performance. The two things can
   interrelate, but not always. Keep an open mind — it sounds like you
   are. Lou

   jonah September 3, 2013 - 9:50 pm

   ok, thank you!

   Thomas September 26, 2013 - 8:13 am

   Hi Lou, i like the ski Hagan Daemon 184 cm / 124-93-114, rocker 35 cm,
   5D profil, very low weight 3,2 kg/177. Stable freeride-touring skis..
   Actually test ( tester weight 260lb /118 kg) , look here:

   Just got myself a pair of K2 Backups with Verticals. Can’t believe how
   good they ski! Relatively light, damp and forgiving with a decent edge
   hold. A great ski for European nonpowdery & unstable conditions.

   Ryan December 9, 2014 - 2:54 pm

   Lou,
   Great website and review. I am seriously interested in the Volkl Nanuq.
   I am just a little intrigued but the sentence, “It’s pretty funny
   seeing Backcountry.com call this a “telemark ski” in the capsule
   review. I was hoping to use this for telemark and although I know you
   guys aren’t huge tele fans would love to know your opinions on whether
   it would suit that purpose. I intend to do 50/50 on/off piste, all
   tele, west coast, probably 22 designs axel bindings or similar (toe
   pivot system).
   Thanks in advance,
   Ryan

Austrian Local Arrested and Cuffed for Skiing Uphill at Jackson, Wyoming

   by Lou Dawson February 9, 2011
   written by Lou Dawson February 9, 2011

   In what could become a public relations disaster on par with Jackson
   Hole Mountain Resort’s harassment of Doug Coombs, this past Saturday
   sheriff deputies assisted by ski patrol arrested and handcuffed Jackson
   area longtime local Roland Fleck for a variety of charges stemming from
   him skiing (with climbing skins) up the resort slopes.

   According to Jackson Hole News and Guide:

   “Fleck, 78, a longtime Jackson doctor, fitness buff and one of the
   original investors in Teton Village, was arrested on misdemeanor
   charges of criminal trespass, interference with an officer, unsafe
   skiing and theft of services. His extrication from the mountain came
   after up to seven ski patrollers spent 3.5 hours trying to stop him…”

   “Skinning is not a Crime!”
   Smokey February 9, 2011 - 12:24 pm

   Just read this story in the JH News and Guide…Uphill travel needs a
   revolution akin to Eygpt. Revolt! Even if you are 78…awsome.
   Tuck February 9, 2011 - 12:33 pm

   “…refused an offer of a free day pass…”? That sounds pretty
   accomodating… Why did it turn from that into an arrest?

   And the notion that skinning up a hill is less safe than skiing down it
   is pretty idiotic. Do they allow snowshoes on the slopes?

   But good for Mr. Fleck! Nice to see he’s still having fun at 78.

   Lou February 9, 2011 - 12:35 pm

   When I’m 78, I hope I get arrested for skiing uphill!

   johnkareoke February 9, 2011 - 12:41 pm

   wtf?!!? He needs a medal, not a record

   Lou February 9, 2011 - 12:51 pm

   I love the Jackson Hole News use of word “extrication.” Makes you think
   they needed the jaws of life to get that pesky 78 year old Tyrolean off
   their slopes.

   mtnrunner2 February 9, 2011 - 1:25 pm

   >”unsafe skiing”

   lol. Well, actually that’s not funny it’s sad. Obviously you don’t want
   people skinning up the middle of a busy trail, but you’d think they
   could come up with some kind of solution.

   One time before first chair on a powder day at Mary Jane, I asked the
   info guy at Mary Jane lodge about skinning before hours (to catch some
   fresh tracks). I got kind of a vague answer about well, it’s forest
   land so you can do what you want, but it didn’t leave me convinced that
   ski patrol wouldn’t stop me. In a valley full of backcountry skiers
   (i.e. at Berthoud Pass and elsewhere) I have never seen anyone skinning
   at the resort.

   tiroler February 9, 2011 - 1:30 pm

   To “ski properly”?!! Ridiculous.

   I have to say it is kind of a strange coincidence, because here in
   Austria, on the very same day (yesterday), a guy skinning up a slope
   got a fine for doing it, which was something unheard of in Austria, at
   least to me… Although it must be said he was climbing after the resort
   closed, which is the main source of conflict between ski resorts and
   ski tourers here, as the resorts claim the ski tourers drinking and
   eating at the mountain refuges in the evening and then skiing down the
   freshly groomed slopes leave tracks that freeze up during the night
   (which is true), making the slopes less fun to ski on the next morning.
   Even if there’s no open refuge in the resort, a lot of people still
   climb for fun/fitness in the evening after work.

   Climbing inbounds during the day is no problem as it’s something that
   has been done for years and both sides act respectfully and get along
   quite well.

   If you understand german:

   esitzstoerung-angezeigt

   JOhn Dough February 9, 2011 - 1:35 pm

   I’ve always wondered how skinning uphill is really any different than
   standing still in the middle of a run. You are not moving at a pace
   much faster than the trees on the side of the run or the skiers stopped
   on the run. Realistically, if someone were to run into you, they would
   be just as likely to run into an inanimate object. Unless of course the
   uphill skier was some sort of rand racer hauling ass at max heart rate.

   Therefore, the argument that it is unsafe doesn’t really hold water.
   Skiing downhill is much more unsafe than walking uphill.

   I’m sure Fleck just wanted to prove a point. It sounds like he has the
   money to do it too.

   Lou February 9, 2011 - 1:35 pm

   As I’ve written about before, the explosion in popularity of skinning
   uphill at resorts is going to result in all sorts of interesting
   developments. These are just the tip of the iceberg.

   tiroler February 9, 2011 - 1:41 pm

   … actually, another thing the resorts don’t like is ski tourers using
   the resort parking lots. Around Innsbruck, on sunny weekend days, when
   the snow in the backcountry isn’t that good, there can easily be 50+
   cars taking up space in the sometimes tiny parking lots…

   Is skinning up inbounds (as training) something that unusual in the US?

   Josh February 9, 2011 - 1:49 pm

   I realize this a blog about backcountry skiing, but I’m shocked that
   everyone here is taking the side of Mr Fleck. Why is it ok for him to
   skin up the mountain to see his granddaughter’s ski race when anyone
   else would need a season pass or lift ticket to be on the mountain?
   Seems to me like Mr Fleck feels that b/c he’s been in the valley for 50
   yrs he’s entitled to do whatever he wants. And that is just plain
   wrong. Those patrollers were doing their job and enforcing the rules of
   the mountain. We’re not talking about skiing outside the boundaries
   here, he was on their mountain without a pass. And then to boot he
   copped a major attitude with the them and the sheriff’s, even after
   they offered him a free day pass (which he refused???).

   Yes, I’m ALL for backcountry access and earning your turns. but this is
   something drastically different here. This man felt that he had paid
   his dues to the area and deserved some sort of special treatment. That
   is the very attitude (entitlement) that has put this great country in
   the toilet.

   Just b/c he was using his own power to go up the hill you guys think
   this is somehow OK? I can’t think of 1 instance where skinning up
   private property without permission from the owner/leaseholder is
   anything other then trespassing. How anyone thinks what this clown did
   is accpetable is beyond me.

   tiroler February 9, 2011 - 2:03 pm

   @Josh: By reading the article, I didn’t get the impression Mr. Fleck
   was acting like a diva and asking for some special treatment, he was
   really just making a point. Like John said earlier, the “unsafe”
   argument holds no ground. Maybe it’s against the official “rules”, but
   I think it might me necessary to rethink those rules if skinning should
   become popular.

   And how is that “different” from earning your turns in the backcountry?
   I don’t know how many visitors Jackson gets on a day, but I’m pretty
   sure the ski tourers are just a very, very small minority. The economic
   argument isn’t valid either. And seriously, if you’re organising a ski
   race and don’t allow relatives and other people to go watch that race….

   John Dough February 9, 2011 - 2:03 pm

   “That is the very attitude (entitlement) that has put this great
   country in the toilet.”

   I would argue that people willing to give up the right to access their
   public lands in the interest of a private entity would be a large cause
   this country going down the proverbial toilet. AFAIK JHMR is on NFS
   land and buying a lift ticket gains you the right to use the lifts. By
   choosing not to ride the lifts you are just accessing your public lands
   as you see fit.

   Walking onto land that is leased by a resort does not constitute
   trespassing.

   Christian Buss February 9, 2011 - 2:11 pm

   This has become a much bigger issue in Europe recently given the
   increasing popularity of touring.

   Spitzingsee and Brauneck in Germany both recently banned uphill
   skinning within resort boundaries. The German Alpine Organisation (DAV)
   is actively lobbying against these bans. Their justification is that
   there is higher risk of a collision, and the resorts hold legal
   liability for any injuries, and have to pay insurance for the risk. The
   touring skiers don’t buy lift tickets so they haven’t contributed to
   cover that insurance risk.

   Interestingly, three ski areas have actually opened up dedicated uphill
   tracks in Germany: Bad Kohlgrub, Unternberg in Ruhpolding and Kolben in
   Oberammergau.

   An article worth google translating:

   Mr. Fleck should move East. Sugarbush, where I ski, is a
   skinning-friendly resort. They even post on their lift report that a
   lift is closed, but hiking up is allowed. Once I heard them say
   skinning up was not allowed while a lift was on wind hold. Five minutes
   later they corrected, and said it was allowed, but please do it up the
   following trail. 🙂

   The mountain even runs a backcountry team for kids that competes in the
   local randonee race.

   Of course Mad River Glen (where the people are mad and they ski next to
   a river) is right next door, and that’s the “earn your turns” resort
   capital of the East. Many of their early-season snow reports depend on
   the skinners going up and checking things out.

   mtmoran February 9, 2011 - 2:22 pm

   I agree with Josh. Mr. Fleck strikes me as a crazy old coot. He’s
   entitled to his eccentricities, but JHMR is entitled to make their
   rules and enforce them.

   Andy February 9, 2011 - 2:33 pm

   I think the mountain has the right to make regulations to protect other
   skiers, but it sounds a little drastic that they don’t allow ANY uphill
   skinning. I’m sure the resort could find at least one trail (groomed or
   not) where they could allow this. If its a money issue, why not charge
   a nominal fee to cover insurance and grooming for those who choose to
   make use of the mountain’s services but not use a lift. And if the
   operators don’t have the sense or inclination to cater to backcountry
   skiers, it seems the solution would be for the public to insist on
   including provisions to allow backcountry access when the lease is
   renewed.

   D February 9, 2011 - 3:04 pm

   So if I ski uphill I can be offered a free day pass? Sounds like a
   plan.

   Paul S. February 9, 2011 - 3:07 pm

   As a former patroller, I think that the JHSP went out of their way to
   try to implement resort policy in the friendliest way they could. If
   the narrative of the article is true, he asked them to call the
   deputies, so he really did talk himself into the arrest. Knowing the
   way ski areas usually think, I would be shocked if they press charges.
   Hopefully JHMR will modify (or create) an up-hill travel policy which
   allows traffic on wide green-circle terrain, but I do think the resort
   employees were trying to “do the right thing.”

   mtnrunner2 February 9, 2011 - 3:09 pm

   Josh said:
   >Those patrollers were doing their job and enforcing the rules of the
   mountain

   That may be, and resorts have the right to develop and enforce rules,
   but that does not mean that skinning up a mountain to ski is
   necessarily inherently wrong, illegal, “stealing”, etc. He’s not
   stealing a pass on the lift, he’s ascending on his own power.

   For example, in the summer ski resorts in CO allow you to hike and run,
   but charge *only for taking the lift*. This issue needs to be taken on
   a resort-by-resort basis.

   And I might add that Wyoming should not have laws telling people what
   they can do on resort property, beyond the usual criminal, violent
   behavior. Resort policy should be 100% up to the resort.

   >And I might add that Wyoming should not have laws telling people what

   These laws are there so that the resort can implement their policies.
   For a very small minority of trouble makers, they have to be able to
   swing a heavier hammer than pulling someone’s pass.

   Brian H. February 9, 2011 - 4:16 pm

   I think its funny that this happened in Jackson (of course!). They had
   to deal with all the Air Force/Coombs stuff. Now they’re getting the
   business from the senior side…Tough job, being on patrol at J.H., in so
   many ways… Free Fleck!

   Njord February 9, 2011 - 4:25 pm

   Folks, please remember that this occured on USFS lands, in other words:
   Our Lands. Funny how we are not allowed to use “our lands” anymore. I’m
   glad to know that the resorts in my neck of the woods (Aspen, Sunlight,
   etc…) has embraced up-hilling and worked towards making it safe and
   enjoyable for everyone!

   My new bumper sticker: “FREE ROLAND FLECK!”

   (which is right next to my “NO HIDDEN GEMS” sticker)

   brian p. harder February 9, 2011 - 4:31 pm

   I’ve known Roland for years and he still gets after it. Yes, he’s
   entitled, a bit, and opinionated and definitely Austrian, with all that
   implies. It has chapped my ass for years that skinning is banned by
   JHMR but since it’s way over “there” from town, I don’t really care.
   Snow King allows it so I’m covered.

   But John Dough’s point is the one I always gravitate to. The risk is
   fabricated by close-minded managers and their paranoia. Yes, the legal
   liability theoretically exists but I wonder if there is really any
   precedent for this. There is certainly not enough of one to force many
   resorts into enacting equally draconian regulations. Even a huge ski
   corp like Sun Valley is totally cool with it.

   T-shirt anyone? Free Fleck – skinning is not a crime!

   DC February 9, 2011 - 4:33 pm

   I presume Mr. Fleck was instigating a test case, given the Keystone
   Cops type behavior. Good for him.

   I think it’s fine and proper for resorts to regulate uphill traffic. It
   is not ok for them to impose a blanket ban on public lands. Hopefully
   we’ll get some more momentum and precedent built towards enforcing that
   against greedy companies.

   Hamish February 9, 2011 - 4:40 pm

   I find this incredulous. US access laws seem ridiculous when compared
   to European countries. Where I live you have the right to responsible
   access anywhere regardless of ownership (obvious exceptions apply e.g.
   around homes). Over here, the idea of being arrested or fined for
   skinning up a piste is laughable. I hope this situation brings change
   to some reasonable access for skinning.

   Lou February 9, 2011 - 4:46 pm

   Brian, you should make some stickers to promote your website. Just have
   them say “Skinning Is Not a Crime” with your website in small letters
   down below. That would be cool, one might even end up on the WildSnow
   mega-truck.

   David K. February 9, 2011 - 5:03 pm

   This is always a tough argument where each side’s opinion is shaped by
   the beliefs of those making the argument. My belief is that people
   should be allowed to skin uphill on our public lands, resorts and
   otherwise. However, I can see arguments that could be made against
   this. For instance, there are many nordic centers that charge fees even
   though they operate on public lands. There are no lifts but they groom
   and prepare trails which carries a significant cost. Technically, how
   different is this from a groomed ski trail that someone is able to skin
   up? My answer would be that the number of uphill skiers who don’t buy
   lift tickets do not materially reduce revenues that are associated with
   grooming costs so the situations are not comparable. But I think you
   could debate this (and we will) forever.

   I think the solution is common sense on the part of resorts and skiers
   who choose to skin and ski inbounds instead of the backcountry. If
   someone like Fleck is skinning uphill on the side of a trail, is out of
   everyone’s way, and isn’t endangering himself (like skinning underneath
   avi control work) then common sense IMHO would be to leave him alone.

   Greg Moellmer February 9, 2011 - 5:15 pm

   I rarely ski up or down at ski resorts anymore, but when I did, I was
   often a little frustrated with patrollers. Some seem to think they are
   cops on skis. It looks like Mr. Fleck met up with a few of that
   variety. Like my dad always told me, “Give a man a radio, and he thinks
   he owns the mountain”.

   Lou February 9, 2011 - 5:30 pm

   Check out what Sunlight Resort in Colorado did with their hiking pass:

   http://www.wildsnow.com/2836/sunlight-resort-upskiing-solution/

   Also, I don’t see any reason why a resort should not charge a small fee
   for uphilling on their groom. Yet better still, perhaps they should
   just figure they’ll make some money from the restaurant on top when
   those hungry uphillers stop in.

   Main thing, as I’ve written here before, the resorts embraced
   snowboarding when they realized they could increase their user numbers
   by hugging snowboarders. Some resorts have a lot of uphillers (hundreds
   a day at Buttermilk near Aspen, for example). It’s only a matter of
   time before such resorts hug those uphillers — if the resort management
   has their heads anywhere but in a certain contorted position.

   Jonathan Shefftz February 9, 2011 - 5:36 pm

   – Maybe the resort has recently changed, but until recently Sugarbush
   was actually among the worst ANTI-skinning resorts in the East (despite
   hosting a rando race, although note that the ascent routes use none of
   the resort trails, except for a short portion of a nearly horizontal

   Tom Gos February 9, 2011 - 5:50 pm

   I believe it is ridiculous to say that people traveling uphill within a
   resort is such a hazard that the resort operators should be allowed to
   ban it outright. But, resort operators should be allowed to put certain
   rules in place, like you must be to the side of the trail, etc. I have
   no problem with there being restrictions on certain activities within
   resorts – I don’t think many of us would want to see recreational
   snowmobile use in a ski resort. Laws and rules should be created to
   punish the idiots, not the innocent. As for resort operators charging a
   fee for uphilling, I disagree. The resort operators are already
   stealing us blind with the ridiculous lease payments they make to the
   federal government, and the way they are allowed to oeprate monopolies
   in terms of on mountain restaurants, ski school, etc. Their profit
   margins are huge, they don’t need any more user fees.

   Scott February 9, 2011 - 5:56 pm

   What liability? Doesn’t Wyoming pretty much idemnify ski areas for
   risks inherent to skiing, like in Colorado?

   Hitting other skiers would seem to fall under that idemnification, so I
   doubt they are too worried about that. Mostly, I suspect the resorts
   just don’t want to deal with any hassles people who can move uphill
   might create for them.

   Dave Hojo February 9, 2011 - 6:21 pm

   Does this mean, that if you lose a ski and hike uphill to get it that
   you’re violating the uphill ski policy? I’ve seen people freak out when
   I’m facing up hill and not freak out at the guy stopped below me who is
   not facing uphill. It has always been a way to prevent actual or
   perceived use of lifts without a lift ticket.

   ac February 9, 2011 - 6:35 pm

   2 things:

   1. john dough has it right:
   “AFAIK JHMR is on NFS land and buying a lift ticket gains you the right
   to use the lifts. By choosing not to ride the lifts you are just
   accessing your public lands as you see fit.

   Walking onto land that is leased by a resort does not constitute
   trespassing.”

   2. resort liability?
   what’s all that small text on the back of the ticket for? they assume
   zero liability.

   Ben W February 9, 2011 - 6:57 pm

   “Sugarbush, where I ski, is a skinning-friendly resort.”

   Something must have changed.

   Magic Mountain, MRG and Plattekill are skinning friendly. Other East
   coast resorts tolerate it at times. Sugarbush has always been quite
   restrictive in all manners of access. If that has changed, that’s
   great.

   Paul S. February 9, 2011 - 7:15 pm

   Skiers sue ski areas several times per season. Sometimes they take the
   ski area to the cleaner, sometimes they get nothing. Liability is a
   funny issue. Every state with a ski area in it has laws saying the ski
   area has no liability, but it doesn’t work that way in court. A
   paranoid lawyer might say that by charging $1 for a “Skinning” ticket,
   the ski area offloads a significant amount of liability vs the case of
   a skier who has no lift ticket of any sort. (When you purchase the
   ticket you have created a contract.) I maintain my stance that JHMR
   really ought to update their policy to allow uphill traffic. On the
   other hand, I have been on the other side where resort guests act like
   they have a right to do anything they want to and even *suggesting*
   that might not be the case is grounds for them to ream you a new hole.

   BTW, I want to make it clear I am not an expert on JHMR or ski area
   operations. My patrol experience is from New England, and I’m sure the
   calculus of risk for people on trails and open/closed areas is very
   different.

   Scott Nelson February 9, 2011 - 7:25 pm

   Glad to be in the Roaring Fork Valley. Skinned Tiehack (@ Buttermilk)
   this morning after a good dump yesterday and near the top of where I
   was going I saw some orange disks marked “Uphill route” where a
   snowmobile had already broken trail for me. Now thats customer service!
   And it made since for the ski area to route the uphillers this
   particular way because it moved them out of a potentially very busy
   spot (aka lots of downhillers). Packing out this part of the uphill
   track was a nice touch.

   Around here, it seems that the resorts do a great job of accomodating
   skinners. Yeah there’s some time restrictions at a couple of the local
   hills (as far as when you can and can’t head up), but if you work then
   you’re gonna be heading up early AM or late afternoon anyways so no big
   deal. And when I go up I try to be as low key as possible, like
   sticking to the sides of runs and generally heading up slopes that
   don’t have much traffic. Bottom line, I am real appreciative of how the
   local hills around here free skinners to do our thing, and trying to
   respect their guidelines (which are relatively minimal here) is pretty
   easy to do for what we get in return.

   Woods Hippie February 9, 2011 - 7:30 pm

   Sounds like a case of hard-headedness on the behalf of the patrol and
   Mr. Fleck. The patrol seemed to perpetuate the authoritarian stance of
   police figures while Mr. Fleck claimed entitlement to something that
   may or may not have been his to claim. Hopefully calm heads will
   prevail in the future.

   Bruno February 9, 2011 - 7:43 pm

   I am a season pass holder at all the areas that I skin, so I feel
   justified in using a parking space and skinning up before or after
   hours. If I didn’t have a pass, I would really see no reason the resort
   couldn’t charge a fee similar to a nordic center. They are providing
   snowmaking, cut runs, and grooming.

   Even if you skin up before/after hours keep in mind that lift
   maintenance staff are running around the mountain on sleds, and several
   have told me it scares the hell out of them to come over a blind spot
   and nearly take out a skinner that they were completely not expecting
   to encounter. This is the main reason a couple areas I know of have a
   no uphill policy as lift maintenance does have a lot of influence.

   skidmark February 9, 2011 - 7:44 pm

   Mr. Fleck was obviously disgusted by the fact that he could not skin up
   to the slalom course to watch his grand-daughter race. He wanted to get
   exercise and not pay to ride the chairlift once. In fact, you have to
   take the gondola all the way up and then ski down to the Casper area to
   get to the slalom course.

   Skinning up was the most direct, most efficient, most exerting way for
   him to do it and his actions hopefully will set a precedent for more
   relaxed attitude on the resort slopes.
   Jackson Hole raised the bar on allowing out of bounds access from their
   slopes. One could argue that if they did not restrict skinning in
   bounds, then many might start to skin to the out of bounds access at
   the resort’s expense (or lack of profit). In the end it is about
   freedom vs. money and money has the upper hand (or lease). Bottom line:
   backcountry is where it is at if you want your freedom. They won’t
   prosecute.
   I was on the mountain Saturday and missed all the action, but then for
   a good reason. I was having the time of my life.

   Lou February 9, 2011 - 7:54 pm

   Such as simple solution. Areas can mark an uphill route, and require
   skinners to use it. What’s so tough about that?

   As for hiking up to watch races, that’s as trad a part of ski culture
   as skis and ski boots. To deny that for a race is nauseatingly naive
   and really shows how backward American ski culture still is, despite
   contributions such as Blizzard of Ahhhs.

   chris February 9, 2011 - 8:04 pm

   I lived in jackson for 5 years and worked there for the two. And this
   is typical Jackson hole corp bs. This company has no respect for the
   locals.

   Lou February 9, 2011 - 8:28 pm

   All sorts of thoughts this brings up. For example, are they now going
   to train Jackson area law enforcement officials on how to remove all
   the different types of randonnee bindings?

   gtrantow February 9, 2011 - 9:05 pm

   Agreed an uphill route solves the problem, BUT we need parking too.
   Locally I am concerned that Ajax limits uphill skinning, Highlands
   limits skinning past Merry-Go-Round and what happens when Tiehack gets
   a HS lift?
   I believe ASC is more enlightened, but will Tiehack parking (paying
   ticket buyers/customers) push aside skinning up at lunch?
   Remember Highlands in 1997? We could park for free and skin up the
   mountain from the base, but not today. As many downvalley locals know,
   skinning up Snowmass is now either a pay-to-park proposition or take a
   shuttle and waste 45 minutes of your day. Snowmass has become a hassle
   due to parking and I am concerned Tiehack is next.

   mc February 9, 2011 - 9:19 pm

   Methinks you’ve had one too many Pabst Blue Ribbons there Stalin.
   :mrgreen:

   Lou February 9, 2011 - 9:23 pm

   Grant, I would agree, Tiehack is next. It is so bloody important to
   provide parking at the base of the family/lunchtime slope, but of
   course those of us who need that are the only ones who understand it….
   I just don’t know how to go about waking up the USFS and their
   permitees to the need for safe, inbounds uphilling. If anyone has any
   ideas, we’re all ears.

   As for Stalin, he’s most certainly part of the problem, not part of the
   solution. Weird, as I just checked a biography of Stalin out of the
   library. I guess I was subconsciously trying to gain an understanding
   of Jackson Hole Resort management (grin).

   Esq. February 9, 2011 - 9:41 pm

   It appears that some think that people are banging down the door to
   skin up the hill in Teton Village. This is not the case.

   I understand that JHMR doesn’t allow uphill travel within it’s
   boundaries for safety. Although uphill travel may be slow, a reasonable
   person would not anticipate this activity on a crowded and narrow
   traverse. Flecks actions endangered himself and others. Weren’t they
   more than courteous in attempting to ask him to stop? They OFFERED HIM
   A FREE PASS for the day. What kind of inhumane monsters run that place?
   His belligerence was kindly ignored for hours and only after he
   insisted on being arrested was he taken down the hill. The horror.

   Resorts on FS land have the right to prohibit uphill travel and this is
   reflected in their permit. If an individual leases property from a
   person or entity, and they make improvements on the leased area (or do
   not), the “leasor” cannot just make entry and go through the fridge.
   Tickets aren’t executed contracts for releases of liability in WY or
   any other state, and resorts have a duty to take some steps to provide
   safety. Otherwise I guess they could allow the uphill crowd and perhaps
   some slednecks as well. Maybe you could put some tracks on the SUV and
   take that up there too. Just keep it slow, and but a ticket. Or not.
   It’s your land, right? Cut down a tree, build a house.

   JHMR as you know, is not located in the East, and avalanche mitigation
   and slope maintenance are quite common. Best access for high and low
   speed as well as big and small types of slope vehicles occurs on the
   same cat tracks and traverses that appeal to skinners. I will submit
   that’s a bad mix in low light situations or before opening. Certainly
   it is a silly prospect when patrol is throwing bombs.

   Fleck has the opportunity to skin a wide variety of terrain in Jackson
   Hole but seemed to feel entitled to make a statement. If people wanted
   to skin up OB and access the resort, although seemingly
   counter-intuitive, this appears lawful. I invite the line to form
   tomorrow. Perhaps Fleck and his supporters needs to better understand
   the law or at least peruse a more worthy cause.

   I wonder if there was a real demand for this activity by a meaningful
   number of people, and the resort was approached, could accommodations
   be made? Why bother, let’s just stomp up the hill. Flecks actions were
   ridiculous. How would you view the story if some kid from Jersey wiped
   him out on South Pass Traverse after the patrolers said “Sure, go
   ahead”?

   Randonnee February 9, 2011 - 9:57 pm

   Lou, I wonder, do have a slight anarchist tendency? Simple solution-
   ski areas should as Lou suggests put in uphill routes, and I would
   think charge something and then allow skiing down in the area. There
   seems to be a market for that. I personally would enjoy a route up out
   of sight of the crowds- in the trees or around the hill from the ski
   runs.

   This discussion is a bit sensationalized as was the incident.

   Ski area operators have authority over the leased area, as it should
   be. Do some here think also that snowmobiles should be ridden up
   operating ski hills since it public land? That is of equal logic to
   advocating free-for-all skinning up an operating ski area.

   On the other hand, I would support more public access/ use of public
   land around or through ski areas, especially ski areas that dominate
   entire mountain passes.

   Lou I think that you are enjoying this!

   TOPDAWG February 9, 2011 - 9:12 pm

   I am a patroller at snowmass, Colorado. If you skin up my mountain in a
   manner that is a concern to me, you are going down. If you disrespect
   me by not acknowledging my authority on my mountain, you are going
   down. People respect us at snowmass. Sure , we get the occassional
   yahoo skiing a closed area or fast in a slow zone. They just don’t do
   it twice. Sounds like my comrades up at Jackson are getting soft.

   Scott February 9, 2011 - 10:27 pm

   Fleck IS entitled to make a statement. He may get a fine out of it, but
   the bad publicity will bring some pressure to bear on jhmr to review
   their policies.

   I don’t necessarily support in bounds skinning, but I am pleased to see
   someone take a stand on something with a little civil disobedience, if
   that is what really happened (as opposed to a gom being cantankerous).
   I just wish people would get more excited about more important issues.

   Bob February 9, 2011 - 10:29 pm

   I’ve been kicked off Copper Mtn for skinning up in the fall before they
   opened. We were not being reckless in any way or getting in their way.
   I don’t think they should have the right to do that. It really seemed
   like a power trip on the part of the patroller. A call to the Forest
   Service confirmed they have the right to close the terrain to uphill
   travel if the resort thinks there is a safety issue, but it needs to be
   well marked at the bottom. It was not. Nor was there a safety issue.
   Just BS.

   I hope this ends up being a PR nightmare for JH.

   I haven’t skinned up a resort run for years now. Nearly all my skiing’s
   been in the B/C the past 3 decades,,,, often in the company of guys in
   their 70s. But in the past, I ascended a few ski areas on waxed
   tele-boards. Maybe next time Dr. Fleck can try waxing up to his
   granddaughter’s race. This whole Fleck fiasco is just incredible. Hey
   JHMR, get a life! Roland, keep on turning out at you granddaughter’s
   races. She must be pretty proud of her gramps.

   Jack February 9, 2011 - 10:44 pm

   Esq, have you no heart?

   Skin on, Dr. Fleck! I’m on your side.

   Skidmark February 10, 2011 - 12:18 am

   Fleck skinning up the traverse alone is no safety issue, but if the
   resort does not enforce their rules against it, groups of skinners
   would be a safety problem. In this sense I understand their reaction
   and subsequent actions due to his behavior.
   No big deal. Bc is another world, as it should be.

   Matt Kinney February 10, 2011 - 1:33 am

   The advantage Mr. Fleck has is numbers to support his cause. The BC
   skiers of the Tetons need to organize a “SKIN IN” at the JHMR.

   What a bunch of hookie cuffing a 70 year old skinning dude. They should
   be ashamed. 👿

   SKIN IN!

   Christian February 10, 2011 - 2:01 am

   Seems that the discussion is too polarized:
   – Uphill skinning can be more dangerous than standing still, as nobody
   has seen you pass. I am thinking of this when I do uphill-skiing in the
   slopes. I have seen skinner traverse the slopes. That is just as stupid
   as the snowboarders that are resting in the blindspots. Thats said: as
   a downhill skier you should always expect there to be somebody in the
   blindspots. I always do, and I beleive that has saved a few persons
   from potential harm.
   – Parking lots can be a problem. I see that a lot at the local resort
   where there is a lot of xc skiers (which is free). Charging for parking
   is the easy solution…and maybe providing a parking pass with the ski
   pass.
   – If there is a lot of skinners…why not capitalize by having an
   uphillfriendly hut at the top? I would use it. Love the alm’s in
   Austria and the huts for xc skiers here in Norway.
   – See the problem with avalanche control…but then you would want skiers
   inbounds, even skinners…?
   (BTW: I am very happy I live in a country where there is free
   manpowered access to all undeveloped land…but there are people trying
   to restrict that to (especially skikiting and mtbing) )

   Ben February 10, 2011 - 4:46 am

   Even I with minuscule ski experience have booted up from Tiehack, in
   little cross-country boots, to get to the XC ski trail toward Snowmass.
   Right under the nose of patrol, too. It’s a lucky thing TOPDAWG wasn’t
   there to clap me in the Pitkin County Jail.

   FS leases typically grant rights to make arbitrary rules in the name of
   safety. Question is whether enforcing an arbitrary rule (that
   undermines the legitimacy of the rule in the eyes of the public) is
   better than having a rule that is actually based on safety
   considerations. Banning all travel is different from banning travel in
   areas closed for maintenance/grooming/control.

   spudskier February 10, 2011 - 5:27 am

   You’d think an uphill approved skin track is an answer, but it ain’t
   that simple. At JHMR’s upper mountain chairlifts, no one checks to see
   if you have a lift ticket. Back in the telly dirt bag days we’d skin up
   the “Hochi-Min Trail” for 45 minutes and ski the rest of the day for
   free on the Casper,Thunder, and Sublette chairs. I’m sure that JHMR is
   aware of that practice and would prefer to not have to place additional
   personnel to check for tix on those upper chairlifts. Any approved
   uphill track would put skinners at the bottom of chairlifts where tix
   are not checked and the resort would be giving free rides and have that
   issue. I skin up Snow king in town and there is no problem- groups of
   skinners on a narrow cat track during operation hours could be a
   problem, though. Anyone who sees these situations in black and white
   terms and with easy solutions ain’t living in reality, sorry to say.
   Best to skin up in the back-country and hope that a snowboarder or
   alpine skier has not bootpacked and post holed the skin track.

   Sam F February 10, 2011 - 7:27 am

   Have any of you ever even been to Jackson? you couldn’t pay me to skin
   up to were that race was.Are you really going to get any enjoyment,
   skiining up crowded groomers?
   And no I would rather not add uphill travelers to the list of
   “characters” you weave through on your way to the tram.
   You can say what ever you want about it being NFS land but I bet you
   would change your tune if someone starting setting a boot pack on your
   skin track.
   It’s about common sence, what if Mr Fleck was arrested for snowmobiling
   to his pine marten trap line he set in Casper bowl. Both respectable
   activities in this part of Wyoming. And, they are both legal on NFS.
   Skining is a wonderful activity, but people like to do other things
   here to. For the most part we try to give each other a little space

   db February 10, 2011 - 8:11 am

   ‘skiing uphill was a violation of Wyoming law’……Really? I’m not from
   Wyoming so is that true?

   Doug Goodwin February 10, 2011 - 8:24 am

   Unbelievable!

   This looks like a sad case of people who feel they have “power”
   exercising their warped sense of law onto others who are simply trying
   to live.

   Lou February 10, 2011 - 8:39 am

   Spud, I agree these things are sometimes not easy to work out, but why
   should that be a barrier to working it out? Heck, building and
   operating a ski resort is not exactly a walk in the park…

   Steve February 10, 2011 - 9:04 am

   Rando, if nothing else, the thought of that old Austrian guy stirring
   the pot brings a smile to my face.

   Brian H. February 10, 2011 - 10:24 am

   If anyone wants to see the “local” response to the Fleck fracas, check
   out Teton At (wildsnow has the link). Some one suggested a “skin In”
   ha!

   Mike B February 10, 2011 - 10:44 am

   Best of luck to Mr. Fleck. The “safety” argument is BS. A skinner is no
   worse than a skier standing still or a snowboarder sitting down. The
   skinner is actually better than someone sitting down because they are
   easier to see. And the slow moving easily predicted skinner is MUCH
   better than a someone skiing/riding in an unpredictable random
   haphazard fashion, like about half the people “legally” on the
   mountain.

   MM February 10, 2011 - 11:04 am

   This guy is a hero! Question authority. Fight the power. Grumpy old men
   (and women) unite!

   Ed February 10, 2011 - 11:37 am

   Is it that:
   Ski Patrollers = First Aiders?
   OR
   Ski Patrollers = Peace Officer/ Officer of the Court/ Police?
   Big difference in standard of care required.
   There is a difference between resort rules and statute law.
   And “policy” does not equal statute law
   Ski Patrollers should be able to quote or provide on paper exactly what
   law Dr Fleck may have hypothetically been transgressing. Section,
   subsection, etc.
   As for the Patroller from Snowmass (Stalin was it?), professional
   police forces usually try and screen characters with this type of
   attitude out – get a job washing dishes until you get your issues
   sorted out son. Just as gun expert does not make cop, so it is that ski
   expert, maybe even credentialed skier, does not make ski patrol
   professional or peace officer. Not on my force.

   Cookie February 10, 2011 - 12:39 pm

   The amount of support that people are giving this guy is disgusting. He
   was being a belligerent a-hole and those who have encountered him in
   the past know that this isn’t the first time he’s acted this way. (Like
   when he walked into the Jenny Lake Ranger Station and called them a
   “necessary evil” even after they had short-hauled his broken body off
   guides wall years ago and more recently offered him shelter in the
   saddle hut for two nights in an early September snow storm.) He doesn’t
   deserve to be glorified. He deserved to be arrested.

   I don’t care if he’s a long-time member of the community. Does that
   mean he shouldn’t be disciplined for breaking the rules? Does that mean
   if he blows through a few stop signs and speeds in the school zones
   that he shouldn’t be ticketed? If I decided to rip around on a
   4-wheeler through the sagebrush flats in GTNP, just because it’s my
   public land, should I be allowed to do that?

   Don’t get me wrong, I love skinning and backcountry skiing. I patrol at
   Snow King and we have three designated uphill routes… it’s the town
   playground and it’s awesome. People can skin up anywhere they want
   before operating hours and even bring their dogs (please clean up after
   them so I don’t have to). There are a lot of blind rollers at the king
   and many times before we open I have been cruising a groomer and been
   unpleasantly surprised by a skinner right below a blind roller. JHMR
   had over 5500 skiers on the mountain that day.

   Furthermore, why would you really want to skin up at JHMR anyway? Snow
   King I can understand (I love being able to get some good exercise less
   than five minutes from my house). But don’t we have enough places
   around here to skin and ski where you won’t piss people off and don’t
   have to skin on crowded groomer?

   Jason February 10, 2011 - 1:43 pm

   I believe the main point that is overlooked is that Mr. Fleck’s
   destination was to see his granddaughters NASTAR ski race. I would be
   upset too if I had to buy a ticket just to ride a chairlift to see my
   daughter race. If he walked from the bottom to the race would he have
   still been stopped for being dangerous?

   Bravo Mr. Fleck for exercising and making a stand to see the race.

   gs February 10, 2011 - 1:48 pm

   i’m with Sam F on this one. I was there on Saturday and that area of
   the mountain was loaded with beginners/intermediates who definitely
   aren’t going to be expecting anyone one to come cruising up a ski run.
   This would have been like saying its ok to drive into oncoming traffic
   on the highway because you’re on your bike.

   Cookie February 10, 2011 - 2:16 pm

   Hey Jason, since you apparently didn’t read the article, Mr. Fleck was
   offered a free ride up the gondi by patrol to watch his granddaughter
   race.

   And how on earth is safety not an issue? Everyone who has posted here
   has agreed that “it’s no more dangerous than someone stopped in the
   middle of a run.” Can’t we all agree that being stopped in the middle
   of a run IS in fact dangerous? How about the two people that just died
   at Hogadon ski area in a collision because of that very thing? The
   universal skier’s responsibility code states “do not stop in any area
   of a run where you cannot be seen from above”.

   Maki February 10, 2011 - 2:40 pm

   This thing is getting widespread. A 2009 regional law in my region
   (Piemonte, Italy) forbids any skinning inbounds, even when the resort
   is closed. This is the result of at least ten years of fighting between
   uphillers and snowcat drivers.

   It’s a serious issue, because since resorts tend to take any safe slope
   certain mountains aren’t legally accessible anymore unless you are
   willing to risk a fine or an avalanche. To add insult to injury the
   same areas get a lot of publicity from ski-rando races…

   I think montaineering associations should lobby to estabilish the right
   to reach the top of the mountains. I have (almost) nothing against ski
   areas, but they cannot monopolize the mountain. Afterall we don’t need
   a lot of space to go up. Nobody wants to skin in the middle of a run
   but, if there is not a dedicated track on safe terrain, keeping a
   reasonable distance from the borders poses no problems whatsoever.

   gs February 10, 2011 - 2:40 pm

   tetonat.com has a very good, level headed take on the issue.

   spudskier February 10, 2011 - 3:14 pm

   I held season passes at JHMR for several years between 1984 and 2002
   and also have backcountry skied 100’s of times on Teton Pass & Teton
   Park, especially since returning to JH last year from SW Colorado. JHMR
   ain’t just ski cuts thru the trees. There are big bowls and chutes- I’m
   aware of at least 3 maybe 4 patrollers who have died doing avy control
   at JHMR. Should skinners be up there when bombs and howlitzers are
   going off? Even with the lifts running an in-bounds customer was buried
   and died near Paintbrush a couple years ago-lawsuit pending. And in the
   80’s a skier had an accidental death going over a massive cliff, in
   pea-soup conditions, skiers left of the tram. Sadly, a fast skier
   killed a hidden from above kid a few years ago. This resort seems to
   constantly have unusual fatalities and some of it is because the unique
   terrain and severe avy conditions.
   I skin up the JHMR after the seasonal closure and on Snow King –but way
   off to the side or when it is closed – its all great. But I can think
   of several narrow cat track traverses at both resorts where a skinner
   or two would really be an unexpected obstacle to downhillers,
   especially the way people ski fast at Jackson. An uphill skinner takes
   10 minutes of time on a traverse compared to a person who skis down it
   in 30 seconds. Even if a downhiller stops on a traverse, it is usually
   for a few seconds break while going downhill. The most likely places to
   skin up at JHMR are the GV trail and Sundance gully. Both of these
   routes are the collector-funnel runs for 90% of people above,
   especially novices coming off Caper Bowl. I would not want to skin up
   those groomed surfaces with lots of novice-intermediate skier traffic
   coming at me. I’ve tried it and it cured me. Any other route uphill
   beside those runs would be through ungroomed crud or moguls. It would
   be often have crappier conditions than a backcountry type skin track.
   So those blue runs are easier ways down and avoid the steep ungroomed
   Lower faces that have crappy low elevation snowpack coverage with setup
   coral reef snow conditions-often as not. So you’d be skinning up down
   low for free on man-made snow until January and in late March in
   typical years. As I wrote earlier, tickets aren’t always checked on the
   mid and upper chairlifts, so the resort would have to pay someone to
   make sure us dirt bags didn’t want a ride for a little extra vertical.
   In summary, I think some mountains (like Snow King) are well suited to
   uphill travel,(with common sense conditions), while JHMR is a different
   animal during the open season. Can I take my rifle and pine marten trap
   up while I’m snow machining up to Corbets, btw?

   Big Chris February 10, 2011 - 3:46 pm

   It’s just not a smart choice to skin at JHMR, especially on the
   weekends. If the mountain was filled with long time locals I could see
   it being O.K.
   There is no shortage of gapers, tourons and new locals who think
   they’re “rippers”. They aren’t! They are dangerous!

   Lou February 10, 2011 - 4:57 pm

   Good thoughts you guys.

   Regarding safety: While I was skinning up a resort today, I came across
   a posse of snowboarders lying down across the ski run like it was a
   couch at a nightclub. Not sure who was creating more hazard, but my
   guess is it wasn’t me.

   jimmy February 10, 2011 - 5:49 pm

   Reason one billon not to ski @a ski “resort”.

   Lou February 10, 2011 - 5:54 pm

   Jimmy, you do have a point.

   Andy February 10, 2011 - 6:04 pm

   Lou, it depends on where you or they were at the time. If they were
   spread out at a highly-visible spot, and you were under a roller, then
   possibly you (as unbelievably irritating as the behavior you describe
   is). I’ve been in situations where both scenarios (snowboarders sitting
   around and skinners coming uphill), in my opinion, have created
   unnecessary risk to others and themselves. Is one inherently worse than
   the other? Not in my mind. I don’t know enough about running a ski area
   to say whether it’s better to ban both or allow both.

   Andy February 10, 2011 - 6:05 pm

   …and what Jimmy said! 😀

   Lou February 10, 2011 - 6:15 pm

   I’d say we should ban napping in the middle of ski runs, or even
   deliberately lying down for any length of time. Common sense? But
   they’re snowboarders. They saved the industry. Lord forbid we would do
   anything to criticize or single them out. Skinners, on the other hand,
   wasn’t it Grand Targhee resort that in 1977 called telemark dirtbags
   “snow maggots” long before forum members at Powder Magazine came up
   with the term? (Wild Snow book, soft cover, page 151.)

   Scott Nelson February 10, 2011 - 6:18 pm

   So Lou, were you skinning up the X Games superpipe?

   Lou February 10, 2011 - 7:30 pm

   No one naps inside the pipe, that’s for sure. Perhaps I should skin up
   it as a protest for something. What that something is, I’ll have to
   think about for a while (grin), save the whales or something.

   Johnny February 10, 2011 - 10:15 pm

   He was arrested because of greed, if the resort let him do that without
   a ticket, then they have to let anyone ski uphill without paying for
   the lifts. JH MR has shown they don’t care about people, pay or get
   out. Its public property and he has every right to be there! I am
   ashamed to say I am from JH after this.

   Ed Shred February 10, 2011 - 10:42 pm

   He was arrested because of liability. All you need is some douche bag
   tourist from Texas suing JHMR because they plowed into an old guy
   skinning up a cat track and there go another few million bucks in legal
   fees and settlement charges.

   There were a lot of ways for everyone to handle this better, but I put
   more of the responsibility on the old skinner than the patrol and
   sheriff.

   CG February 10, 2011 - 11:07 pm

   I believe the property at the Base of JHMR is 100% privately held. The
   land owners (JHMR does not own all of it) can close and control access
   to public lands if they so desire. This issues seems to come up
   frequently during hunting season.

   spudskier February 11, 2011 - 1:18 am

   CG, the road into Teton Village is dedicated to the public as well as
   some others. The START bus goes there and there are access points and
   summer trailheads off public roads to Bridger -Teton NF.No one owner
   could close off access here. That situaton is more common with land
   owners who prevent short crossings from ski outs along private sections
   on Fish Creek road.
   JHMR does restrict parking but not everyone who parks skis- they shop,
   eat at restaurants, work, — it would be impractical to separate
   free-skinners from anyone else using the parking or riding the bus.
   There is no reason a regular skin track couldn’t be established going
   up Rock Springs Canyon,which is out of bounds- but even here a lot of
   upper gate skiers would encounter skinners in the narrows of the
   canyon. There are so many places to go around here , why fight the
   crowds on groomers? Its kinda selfish to use man-made snow, groomed
   snow and the patroller’s avy control, and then be an extra obstacle on
   a narrow cat track- going against the grain of travel in busy traverses
   with bind corners. I’ll wait till after 5:00 Pm or the April closing or
   go to Snow King for fitness laps.

   g February 11, 2011 - 10:12 am

   EdShred’s comment:

   “All you need is some douche bag tourist from Texas suing JHMR because
   they plowed into an old guy skinning up a cat track and there go
   another few million bucks in legal fees and settlement charges.”

   Typical comment from someone with no understanding of the legalities.
   Wyoming’s recreational liability act would bar any such cause of
   action. I am not aware of JHMR ever losing or for that matter settling
   any lawsuit pertaining to any skier injury incurred on-mountain . As an
   example, JHMR was sued for a skier running into one of their worker’s
   snowmobiles, which was parked essentially on slope and left. the
   plaintiff lost, and got nothing. Noone from texas that runs into
   another person on skis at the area is going to get anything. Chances
   are they would be hard pressed to even find an attorney to take their
   case, since wyoming attorneys would no it is a loser.

   The law is a good one. Just think about it, if texans could sue JHMR
   for such things, it would not be worth JHMR to run its lifts. Same
   principal applies to most all other ski areas.

   Lou February 11, 2011 - 10:20 am

   From what I understand, in many cases the “liability” excuse for not
   doing something is specious. For example, here in Colorado our ski
   resorts are protected by law from a certain amount of liability. They
   can of course still be sued, and sometimes people win, but only in very
   egregious cases. Ditto for private land, the owners of which are
   protected by lawsuits from people who cross or go on their land for
   recreational reasons. Hunting, for example.

   Basically, when a resort plays the legal liability card for not doing
   something, my BS meter pegs to the red zone. Reality is if they can
   make money from something and it’s not too crazy, they’ll try it. All
   the “extreme” terrain is a good example. Or perhaps terrain (broken
   bone) parks are a better one.

   By the way, in my opinion protecting industry from lawsuits is good to
   a degree, but can also be a consumer rip off. That holds true for ski
   resorts just as it does for the automobile industry. When you send your
   6 year old kid up to the local ski resort for a day of fun, you don’t
   expect them to come home in a box — the resort has to be held
   accountable to making things safe, and there has to be consequences for
   them not doing so. It’s a question of balance, I guess.

   Wade February 11, 2011 - 10:56 am

   Lou is right, in that this is only the beginning of these types of
   conflicts as the popularity of skinning escalates. What worries me is
   the attitude of some posters that we have a “right” to skin up any ski
   area we wish. Nothing could be further form the truth. Ski resorts are
   a profit making concern that have significant expenses and daunting
   liability concerns. If we have a “right” to skin up as we choose, why
   doesn’t a backcountry snowmobiler have the “right” to head up the
   mountain as he chooses??

   Part of the problem IMO, is this outmoded language of the phrase “lift
   ticket”. It sort of insinuates that you’re only paying to use the
   lifts, not ski at the area. In some people’s minds this creates the
   notion that if you’re not using the lifts, you don’t need to pay.
   Something like Daily Admission Pass is probably more in keeping with
   the truth.

   The more hostility and push back we BC skiers level at the area and
   it’s management, the more they are likely to return in kind. Like
   almost anything else we do, access to our favorite outdoor areas is a
   privilege so let’s treat it that way.

   Randonnee February 11, 2011 - 11:01 am

   A ski area is not the same as other public land. It is operated under
   Permit and the operator is required to safely administer the area and
   is liable to do so. The ski area operator with USFS oversight decides
   what management is appropriate. The guy intended to cause a problem and
   according to the article his behavior was atrocious.

   If I were skiing with my young daughter and a fast skier dodges mr
   arrogant uphill skinner perhaps the fast skier will hit my daughter.
   This simple behavior that goes against the intended use, as designed,
   may have ripple effects on safety. Ski areas are dangerous enough, I
   have spent some years picking up busted folks and yes some from
   collisions and yes some kids. It is quite irresponsible and selfish in
   my view to demean safety considerations for the sake of selfish
   behavior.

   No, I will not intend to defend management, I have seen management
   elsewhere do the wrong thing plenty of times in outrageous examples.
   However, I will label much of this discussion as self indulgent,
   selfish, inconsiderate of others, and unrealistic. The guy as described
   is an arrogant jerk trying to cause problems.

   Lou February 11, 2011 - 11:09 am

   Rando, point taken. What I’m asking is that resorts accommodate
   skinning, perhaps by designating an uphill route, and charging a small
   fee if necessary. I’m not advocating that folks can just skin straight
   up any ski run, any time. Heck, try that in Spar Gulch on Aspen
   Mountain at 2:00 pm on a groomer day, and you’d be killed — or as you
   say, a skier dodging you could kill someone else.

   As for our Tyrolean skinner, I think if he was trying to cause problems
   that’s a good thing for the above goal. Perhaps the exact location of
   his skin climb was inappropriate, but in my view most resorts will
   sooner or later need to accommodate uphilling just as they accommodated
   snowboarders.

   Matt Kinney February 11, 2011 - 12:05 pm

   Rondonne

   They tackled, handcuffed, and then strapped into a sled a 78-year old
   man using a bunch of patrollers and some town cops. He was skinning up
   to watch his
   Granddaughter’s ski race. Obviously, an over reaction by the patrollers
   no matter what the “policy” states. They could have just as easily kept
   an eye on the guy from a distance and let him do his little activist
   thing. The patrollers acted like thugs.

   I certainly can sympathize with activists and protesting. Been doing it
   since Vietnam. Some of us out here stand our ground in the face of what
   we perceive as wrong. Mr. Fleck is in a long line of activist who act
   on issues for all those who hide behind there desk so they do not “get
   involved”, yet support those who go out and fight for causes. It is
   about as American as it gets. Fleck took the hit for many who support
   his action. He deserves a break, not your ridicule. Geewhiz… the guy is
   nearly 80!

   Not everyone tucks his or her shirt in like you. I like to wear mine
   inside/out from time to time.

   Josh February 11, 2011 - 12:09 pm

   I commented a couple of days ago on this and at the time i was the only
   person who thought what Mr Fleck did was moronic. Glad to see other BC
   skiers agreeing with me, but the amount of you that still are taking
   this man’s side amazes me.
   It’s not just about fighting establishment here guys and gals. Sure
   that is fun from time to time, but some people here really need to wake
   up. If you want to skin, ski, whatever in the mountains there are
   endless routes, trails, whatever in the US and abroad to do so. Why do
   people feel they have to do this at resorts? People, partnerships and
   such have invested great amounts of money and time in these places. If
   you think for one minute they are going to open themselves up to legal
   issues so people can skin up their mountain, you’ve been living in the
   woods for too long!
   The argument that JHMR is on federal land and they only lease it is
   even worse! Let me ask you this….if you rent/lease a house that is on
   state or federal land (low income housing, etc), is it ok for any
   citizen of the US to come and use your bathroom? How about your
   kitchen? I think the answer is NO.
   I think its time people who are taking Mr Fleck’s side forget their
   silly crusades for a few minutes and just use some common sense. My
   guess is you’ll all realize this guy was offered all sorts of
   concessions from the JHMR ski patrol (which they weren’t obligated to
   do) and still acted like a complete and utter A**hole. He got exactly
   what he deserved. This isnt like the stories from the 90’s of people
   getting tackled by patrollers in the backcountry and sherriff’s setting
   traps. This is 1 miserable, old bastard thinking he was entitled. Guess
   what Mr Fleck….you are no different then any of us.

   Bard February 11, 2011 - 12:59 pm

   I was asked by ski patrol to leave Snowbasin, Utah a few years ago for
   “going the wrong way”; i.e. uphill. I politely acquiesced, but there
   was a sliver of Fleck-like resistance to authority in the back of my
   mind.
   If you’re skinning up a groomer at a resort, you deserve to get run
   into, and if you’re skiing so fast or out of control that you can’t
   avoid objects, you deserve to run into something.
   I like to oversimplify things.

   Top Dawg

   Little reminder, it is not “your mountain”. You are a snowmass
   employee. In other words you are their “bitch” little tough guy. 😉

   Peter K February 11, 2011 - 2:34 pm

   Designated skinning trail with disclaimer/waiver at trail head = done.

   I’m not sure if I would trust the ski resorts to limit potential user
   fees to just a “nominal fee”. They will ding us for insurance, grooming
   maintenence fees, overhead even though we are not using the lifts, and
   ski less than a tenth of the vertical that regular lift skiers would
   use. They could set the price so high that it would deter anyone from
   skinning there!

   skidmark February 11, 2011 - 3:21 pm

   This discussion has two fronts:

   One is that Fleck did or did not have the right to skin up to his
   granddaughter’s ski race. And to that end, was it an arrogant, selfish
   act or a heroic act. I do not know alleged law-breaker, but it seems
   that refused to cooperate and asked for it, despite the subsequent bad
   publicity it may cause the resort.

   The other discussion is whether resorts (JHMR) should consider
   accomodating skinning in the future. I would agree that systems could
   be put in place, but personally do not like the idea, mainly because we
   would have to rename BACKCOUNTRY skiing! Let’s get back there and leave
   the resorts to the masses.

   Lou February 11, 2011 - 3:30 pm

   Good point Peter. Problem is, I see no other alternative under existing
   laws. Once the resort has special use permit or is on private land,
   they pretty much call the shots. I most certainly am one who advocates
   for our “rights to use our own public land,” but a long time ago the
   special use permit system was created, and it is law, no matter how
   crumby we think it is.

   FYI, the exact same law is used for things such as keeping snowmobiles
   away from 10th Mountain Huts in Colorado.

   Randy February 11, 2011 - 5:09 pm

   My two cents; if the man was skinning up the middle of a busy run, he’s
   a dolt (I’m not familiar with Jackson Hole) and the ski patrol behaved
   correctly. If he was off to the side, or on the side of a wide cat
   track, what do they care? In my experience, if you give somebody power,
   sooner or later they will abuse it; it sounds like the Jackson Hole Ski
   Patrol way overreacted in this case, and especially with a man of his
   age.
   I’m sure we’ve all spent years dodging goofus, “tree-pig” ski
   patrollers in the old days when we were ducking ropes to get at the
   pow; ski patrollers are no better or no worse than anybody else, it’s
   all in how well they’re trained and managed. Yes, they have to rescue
   the occasional idiot who gets lost on the backside, but isn’t that what
   they get paid for? Ski areas are way over-managed sometimes because
   they basically cater to idiots who won’t take responsibility for their
   own actions. Seems like Jackson Hole needs to work on its image and
   patrol-training a little; if Fleck was in an unsafe area I would have
   escorted him -peacefully- to an area that was safer and then skinned up
   with him to make sure he stayed out of trouble (do the patrollers there
   even carry skins?); then had a long talk with him after he’d watched
   his daughter’s race. If he was in an area where skinning was safe then
   Jackson Hole needs to rethink its policies and its heavy-handed
   behavior, IMHO.

   Randonnee February 11, 2011 - 8:50 pm

   Yes guys I would be for some designated uphill areas and if I were
   involved in a ski area as long ago I would be a proponent.

   The old guy got what he wanted, he taunted the authorities on several
   levels, he deserves to be subject to the legal system.

   In my time working at a ski area I recall one individual who wanted to
   push it. The guy had something to prove or an attitude some express
   here, rebellion and anarchy against reasonable and codified authority.
   So instead of a simple send away from a Patrol Director of Ski Area
   Security, that guy worked his way into handcuffs with the Sheriff and
   then a Court appearance. The result was that the guy was prohibited for
   four years not just from that ski area, but from all USFS lands within
   100 miles of that ski area.

   Yes, skinning is a good thing, I hope allowances are made in many
   places for it.

   No, that dysfunctional rebellious sentiment and fuzzy feelings do not
   trump civility, law, authority, and especially do not trump the greater
   good over a single person’s selfish act.

   mc February 11, 2011 - 9:20 pm

   Saw a picture of Mr. Fleck on Teton AT (now idea how old it is) but the
   guy certainly looks like he can handle himself. I’m in his corner on
   this one. Would have loved to have seen him stomp across the
   patroller’s skis.

   skier February 11, 2011 - 9:42 pm

   Why is this persons age a concern? Why was his intent ( granddaughters
   race) a concern? Do these things change the facts? Tackled? Definitely
   not. Does avalanche hazard reduction fit into many posters scenarios?

   Adam Olson February 12, 2011 - 8:44 am

   How funny? It isn’t surprising the chains of the patrolmen were so
   easily jerked. I’m sure JHMR makes these guys and gals wear “sharp
   necklaces” everyday. But the fact that any constituent can be barred or
   banned from National Forest is a very disturbing trend around the
   country. The sense of entitlement the operators work with borders on
   being a violation of the very leases they hold! Down here in Aspenland
   The SkiCo. has banned a ski instructor from “all Aspen Skiing Company
   property” for merely speaking his mind. There interpretation of “SkiCo.
   property” includes the leased land in there permit! They think they OWN
   the land. Preposterous!

   The example of a home lease was compared to the operating lease the ski
   areas have. Though this is a poor comparison, if the owner of the lease
   (the constituents) allowed access before you signed the lease agreement
   you do not have the right to stop access while you are the leaseholder.
   You may not like it but access has been granted. I find it difficult to
   understand all the empathy for JHMR. WE ARE THE LEASEHOLDERS!!!

   A Judge really needs to rule on this and put the ski areas in there
   place. You cant keep the people out of public land.

   p.s. I think “Top Dawg” is the face of Ski Patrol. Lets arm them too?

   Sam F February 12, 2011 - 9:20 am

   For the last time Mr Olsen you can’t just do whatever you want at a ski
   resort because it’s national forest. Otherwise there would thousands of
   snowmobilers trying to high mark Casper bowl. Or can I carry a rifle
   for furharvesting while I’m skiing? I’ve skied some peaks in the
   Tetons, explored the backcountry around togwotee pass,and otherwise
   greatly enjoyed skiining but, there is a time and a place for anything.

   I worked as a snowmaker this year we were kinda suppose to stop people
   from skining. Thing is say early Oct. when there wasn’t mush snow, and
   the resort wasn’t open, people would skin up and ski down on the snow
   we were making.
   Guess what, noone really cared.
   What this crazy old loon was doing is just not smart. And yes I’m sure
   the police(it was not the mt patrol who restrained him) went way over
   the line but, it is pretty clear this guy just wanted to make a scene.

   And by the way this isn’t going to change ANYTHING about Jacksons
   uphill policy. There will never be a skin track to the nastar race
   course

   Lou February 12, 2011 - 9:47 am

   Adam and Sam, you both make good points. In my opinion, yes, since the
   lease is on USFS land and it is intended for recreation, I’d imagine
   there are certain limits on just how restrictive or dictatorial the
   lease holder can be. More, we have an expectation that the lease holder
   would condone and support appropriate ski related activities, one of
   which is uphilling on skis.

   On the other hand, it is indeed important to acknowledge that
   controlling what activities occur on the ski slopes is a key part of
   operating a ski resort under a special use permit. We shouldn’t fault
   the resort for exerting reasonable control, however, I call foul on
   them not accommodating uphill skiing (I’m talking general view here,
   not Fleck specifically). In my view, this resistance to uphilling is
   the same thing as when many resorts banned snowboarding. They perhaps
   had the right to ban snowboarding, but did they do so at the risk of
   getting the USFS to review their special use permit, and in terms of
   ethics and culture, should they have banned snowboarding?

   As for the old guy doing what appears to be civil disobedience, if he
   was in Egypt would you naysayers be cheering him? I like what he did,
   even if it wasn’t perfect. Ask Gandhi; creating change through social
   action isn’t an exact science.

   Again, in my view, what some resorts need to do is designate an uphill
   trail, perhaps even off the ski runs up through the woods, and be done
   with it. Such a trail could be skied down and slipped once in the
   morning by a resort employee, and once at the end of the ski day by a
   resort employee. It would be for uphill only other than patrol checks.
   Just as they do at Sunlight, Colorado, all uphillers would be required
   to hold a free “hiking pass” that had the liability waiver and all
   that. Potential for charging too much money is there, and that could be
   the trouble with my idea, but I just don’t see any alternative if we
   want resort uphilling.

   Only “but” is that some resorts don’t check tickets on upper lifts, and
   depend on their policy of no uphilling to keep that viable. If they
   accommodate uphilling yet don’t check tickets at all lifts, they end up
   with the old “Ho Chi Min Trail” situation. Is that a big “but?”
   Absolutely not. All it takes to shut down bandit lift riding is to do
   random ticket checks and arrest anyone found stealing lift rides. After
   a few of those, no more bandits. Yeah, I’ve stolen a few rides myself.
   Because I could. But if I’d known I could end up in court I’d have
   skipped those little stunts. In other words, a resort doesn’t have to
   hire more employees or install more equipment to deter bandit lift
   riding. They just do some random ticket checks, and that’s that. So
   that issue is a red herring when it comes to this discussion.

   Matt Kinney February 12, 2011 - 11:25 am

   Lou…Maybe its time for you to approach Fleck for an interview?

   If I look to the future, I would hope resorts accommodate old folks who
   need a safe place to skin and ski. Lets face it, someday I and most of
   us here will not want to deal with a big pack/avalanche issues because
   of various physical impediments. There are going to be 100’s of us. At
   70, I am not going to be digging anyone out of avalanche debris very
   fast. There are other safety issues that we may not want to deal with
   in a BC setting. Many of will always want to skin up and ski down so we
   can maintain some level of fitness as we age. We will never lose our
   passion to skin/ski. Resorts need to respect that. (They should
   actually honor it.)

   When I get older just getting on and off a lift may be a liability. But
   maybe I can skin up the hill just fine, breath mountain air, hear
   others laughing as they ski, do a lap somewhere, wave at patrollers,
   and go sit in the pub and sip beer, then go do it again. Being able to
   stay connected to the mountain culture would be a great gift to many of
   us as we get older.

   brian p. harder February 12, 2011 - 12:49 pm

   Well said, Matt. You know, I was getting tired of all the inbounds
   skinning bashing. All these a–holes too cool to be seen doing it. As
   Matt said it so well, sometimes you just want to get some aerobic
   exercise in our favorite form – skinning uphill – without the inherent
   distractions of being in the bc. And his point about the aging skier is
   another good one.

   Scott Nelson February 12, 2011 - 2:32 pm

   Exactly. I think a lot of people fall into this category (that
   Brian/Matt described), especially as you get older, have less time,
   have health issues that would make it dangerous to be in the bc,
   etc….They’re are some uber fit people that do this that probably never
   even hit the bc. Being able to use the resorts provides a relatively
   safe place to test/excercise your aerobic mettle. Resort skinning is
   just getting more and more popular, so I doubt that this will be last
   time this whole issue comes up.

   Lou February 12, 2011 - 4:50 pm

   In honor of this discussion, my wife and I just had a beautiful day
   doing skin laps at Tiehack near Aspen. We did three rounds, not huge as
   in Greg Hill huge, but a good day for us. It was beautiful. Super
   cardio, saw lots of friends, hung out on the sundeck at the restaurant,
   skied some groomers, parked 20 feet from where we put our skis on.
   Truly a worthy day that didn’t require a helmet cam and blog to make
   real.

   I’d add that we have in Tiehack the ideal place for inbounds uphilling.
   Even on a weekend the runs are practically deserted, it’s the perfect
   amount of vert at about 1,800 as you can do a quick time-trial type of
   lap, or do multiple laps if you want an endurance workout that mixes it
   up enough not to get boring. Having a restaurant at the top is also
   key. Oh, and having a parking area a few feet from where you start
   skiing is also part of what makes it work (rather than the endless
   parking hassles, paid parking, and transport mode changes required to
   access the base of most of our other resorts)

   What worries me is that the Aspen Skiing Company has permission in
   place to build the proverbial high speed quad on Tiehack. Presently,
   much of the reason Teihack is a skinners (and uphill walkers) paradise
   over there is that the lengthy lift ride scares lift skiers off. Once
   the quad is in, the place will be mobbed as the slightly steeper trails
   are much better for many skiers than the even flatter ones on the rest
   of the mountain, and the parking will be maxed or perhaps even
   eliminated since our local governments and the ski company basically do
   everything they can to make driving your own car (lord forbid) to the
   skiing as inconvenient or downright torturous as possible. In other
   words, once they build the high-speed lift, our little uphilling
   paradise will be no more. That’s when we really need to work with Skico
   to designate a cool uphill route through the beautiful aspen forests on
   that side of the mountain. I’m actually pretty confident we can get
   this done with a small amount of citizen activism. It would be great PR
   for Skico, and yet another neat thing to offer their guests.

   vanessa February 12, 2011 - 6:45 pm

   I have never been harassed by anyone for skinning up at either Keystone
   or A basin…I can’t imagine why it would be a problem as long as you’re
   on the side of the trail, respectful to others, and staying on trails
   that aren’t so steep you’re trying to sidehill/switchbacking or
   anything silly like that.

   UltraApple February 12, 2011 - 9:03 pm

   Not taking sides I think it would be nice if local ski area’s opened an
   uphill track for those who want to use it. They could charge $5 per day
   to use it and probably make money on it. If nothing else I’m pretty
   sure some of the people using the track would buy food and drink after
   a day of skiing. On the flip side, if avalanche conditions are bad and
   I’m feeling inbounds would be better I grab my x-country skis and have
   a fun day far far away from all the crazy people and kids that resorts
   attract at a snow-park. For me its getting out and having a fun day.
   X-C or Backcountry it doesn’t matter as long as I wake up the next day
   ready to do it again!

   TOPDAWG February 12, 2011 - 8:54 pm

   Come to snowmass and act in a way that concerns me on my mountain and
   you will go down. The ski patrol is the reason that anyone can ski our
   steeps(home of the colorado freeride series.) We manage two zones that
   contain the most challenging terrain in the U. S. We also thanklessly
   keep the mountain safe for our guest (yahoos included.)
   Speaking of yahoos, I noticed a familar name crying about leaseheld
   land. When we hold the lease, we hold the lease. Play by our rules,
   period. It is ironic that I had words with this “blogger”/ foul ball
   about skiing in one of my closed areas. He felt his snowpack evaluation
   skills were on par with the “trollers” and decided to go O B. The
   result of his actions led to a class 3 avalanche and greater respect
   for the patrol.
   Lou is correct in commeting about not having someone end up in a box
   after a day of skiing. We are the ones that keep it that way.

   Greg Moellmer February 12, 2011 - 10:24 pm

   When I read TOPDAWG’s comment a couple days ago, I got a good chuckle,
   because obviously he was just joking. The whole thing about “if you
   don’t respect my authority, you’re going down” just had me rolling. But
   then I read the post two above mine and now I’m not so sure. That’s the
   trouble with the internet is you never know when someone is just
   pulling your leg. Topdawg, please respond and let me know if you’re
   being serious or not. Wondering is just killing me. And if you are
   serious, please tell me you work in law enforcement during the off
   season. Then, this will all make sense.

   brian p. harder February 12, 2011 - 10:32 pm

   Wow, Topdawg is awfully fond of himself. I have not seen that kind of
   hubris in awhile. I can’t get these images out of my mind of a guy in
   front of a mirror with all his ‘toller regalia on admiring how he looks
   like a bad-ass enforcer. All he needs is a Beretta 9mm side arm. Grrrr!
   This is MY area!! I almost shot milk out my nose reading that!
   Priceless. To quote Bill Murray….”lighten up, Francis”.

   On a more pertinent note… well said, Lou! My point exactly.

   mc February 12, 2011 - 10:34 pm

   Topdawg? Top Gun? Maverick? This is getting blurry. Somebody cut this
   guy off, this shopping mall cop song and dance is amatuer at best.
   You’re not doing professional patrollers any favours either.
   Is it April 1st or are ya just gettin around to the other half of that
   six-pack? 😈

   Gringo February 13, 2011 - 3:50 am

   Topdawg is taking advantage of an unusual occurance in JH to embarass
   himself. Strange.

   Lou February 13, 2011 - 8:30 am

   I’ll leave Topdawg’s vague innuendos and overblown prose standing for
   the amusement value, but he’s a good example of how NOT to build a
   comment.

   What is more, I don’t think he realizes he’s preaching to the choir to
   a great extent. Which makes his comments double amusing.

   I’m sure I can speak for most of us in saying that we like having ski
   resorts and ski patrol, see the need for rules, and any point that
   sounds contrary to that is simply made because we feel uphilling can be
   part of that mix.

   As for the Fleck incident, we’re simply using that as a point of
   discussion, and from the media account the discussion had to have
   touched on whether the ski patrol was heavy handed or not. As a rule
   enforcer, I’m certain Topdawg must know that how you enforce rules may
   result in judgment calls and choices about how harsh you approach a
   rule breaker, or even exactly what enforcement behavior you choose to
   exhibit. For example, exactly when do you call the sheriff? What do you
   do if the person you contact becomes violent? Or the big one, how heavy
   do you enforce and interpret “safe” skiing rules? The latter is a huge
   gray area for ski patrol.

   As for people making poor judgment calls and getting caught in
   avalanches, ski patrol is not immune to that, so if I were him I’d look
   in the mirror on that one rather than indulging in petty finger
   pointing and innuendo.

   stewspooner February 13, 2011 - 10:05 am

   In my experience, ski patrollers in the US of A tend towards
   authoritarianism, demanding unqualified submission, and making and
   aggressively enforcing rules that need only be guidelines. This is not
   the place to examine the broader cultural context (militarism, eternal
   adolescence etc.), but it’s not necessarily the same way throughout the
   rest of the world, and is not acceptable. I find skiing under such
   circumstances to be oppressive, and that the only sane response is to
   head into the backcountry.

   Bobby February 13, 2011 - 11:15 am

   Some folks look for answers, others look for fights. Some folks up in
   tree tops, just looking for their kites.

   HeavyD February 13, 2011 - 11:20 am

   I need to give “spudskier’s” first comment a bump. Living in JH for
   fifteen years I see two main issues at play. 1. The resort does not
   check tickets at the upper lifts, and does not want to pay someone to
   do so. Skin up, ski the upper lifts for free all day. Unfortunate the
   resort does not have the cojones to admit this. Instead it is thinly
   veiled by an issue of “saftey”. BS! The bottom line is money. Period.
   2. Patrol here has their occasional Mubarak moments. A little power in
   the wrong hands……..’nuff said.
   Also, uphill skiing is legal in Wyoming. Do it often at Snow King
   resort here in town, legal and safe don’t anyone tell you otherwise.

   Johnny February 13, 2011 - 11:17 am

   He would be my hero… if he was trying to stop a gas fracking operation.
   They keep getting closer to the Valley. Otherwise, let’s see; his son
   works for Spence Law, he is an original investor at the Resort. Sounds
   like
   JH Royalty. His granddaughter’s race? No one else was racing?
   And if her racing was important, then why did he make himself MORE
   important?

   Sam February 13, 2011 - 2:04 pm

   Just what I witnessed when I was a worker at JHMR:

   in my experience @ JH, skinning in bounds and uphill was and is usually
   done before sunrise/opening to public. Also, the person skinning uphill
   usually has good beta on what/where to go on the hill and has first
   hand knowledge. Simple things like winch cats – snow makers- night ops
   and various crew make up the night creatures. These are simple things
   to look out for when you do decide to take on a ski area uphill in the
   dark.

   I specifically remember back in the day when Chris Kroger and various
   JH patrol used to climb uphill before work. Usually meant they had
   already clocked in, dressed up and decided to skin to there respected
   stations rather than ride the chair. (this usually worked time wise
   when the patroller was working a south side station. (ie: AV or
   Casper). In fac,t this practice still goes on today….

   Mr. Fleck was probably at the hands of a patroller who was, in fact
   having a rough start to his/her day? No, maybe a manager who received a
   report about uphill traffic and a patroller who otherwise would have
   NOT bothered with the uphill vagrant had to step in and dictate policy?
   It could be many reasons. All i know is a 78 year old man is not going
   to listen to someone who is 40 +/- years younger than they are.
   (regardless of offering a ticket or not. Fleck has more time going
   uphill than most would be skiers have going downhill. He was in his
   right AND he is ALWAYS off the hill before opening to public.

   “half my cents”

   Sincerely Bummed-

   Lou February 13, 2011 - 3:47 pm

   I heard the Jackson ski patrol has their own personal bar complete with
   beer on tap (for after work). Anyone know if that’s true or not? Just
   curious, since we’re on the subject of those guys.

   scottyb February 13, 2011 - 5:35 pm

   Topdawg sounds like a holster sniffer to me, ie frustrated wanna be
   cop. That same attitude weekend patrollers have which gets them 0
   respect.

   It would be nice if there could be trails for designated skinning at
   areas. There are days I want to ride lifts and days I want to get away
   from the crowds, the latter usually involves my skins.

   Duder should have just taken the free pass.

   Lou February 13, 2011 - 6:16 pm

   Scotty, funny thing is, we went backcountry today and it was LESS
   peaceful than when we skinned the resort yesterday! Weird. But true.

   scottyb February 13, 2011 - 6:50 pm

   That is weird, the least peaceful event on a recent outting was being
   topped out on the hill and watching a pair of F-18’s fly below us after
   doing mock bombing runs on a nearby power plant. Lasted less than 30
   seconds but was still pretty kewl. 😉

   Dan February 13, 2011 - 8:18 pm

   Simply truths;
   Resorts have rules,
   Skinning uphill in a resort in the USA is not considered normal. (i.e.
   proper)
   Patrollers are told to stop people from skinning uphill
   If you are asked politely seven times to stop breaking the rules and
   even offered a frees pass, and you treat the people who are simply
   trying to do their job like trash, and ask for a ticket, then refuse to
   receive the ticket, you should be dragged away.
   Patrollers have enough serious things to worry about, geriatric antics
   shouldn’t be one of them.

   Dan February 13, 2011 - 8:25 pm

   Furthermore,
   The amount of support coming from the site loyals makes me question
   intelligence.
   I reckon that’s my opinion though.

   Jonathan Shefftz February 13, 2011 - 8:35 pm

   I like how the behavior of the patrollers in question can be reduced to
   a four-second video:
   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIVHNylH1Mk
   (I also like how I don’t have any colleagues like that at the two areas
   where I patrol.)

   Adam Olson February 13, 2011 - 8:43 pm

   I love it TopDawg is said to be a “holster sniffer”! 😯

   John W February 13, 2011 - 10:22 pm

   JH Ski Patrol headquarters with a keg (aka ‘The Boom Boom Room’) is
   long gone but the espirit de corps lives on. They maintain a big
   mountain. That said, I think JHMR should accommodate uphill use,
   Snowbird does so with no problems. 20 years ago the JH ski patrol were
   the cops busting out of bounds skiers, Now OB is a profit center for
   the resort. My guess is that in 5 years there will be mountain hosts at
   the base to guide hikers up (to the restaurants).

   Rules are important, but not always perfect. Yes, resorts have rules.
   They’re not perfect. Events like this help refine the rules. As for
   being dragged away, does that include tasering, or just the use of a
   club? A better outcome would have been to just let the guy go on
   uphill, then bring him to court later. I mean, what would be so
   problematic about that? As for patrollers doing what they’re told, they
   do, and they don’t. I’ve got that on good authority.

   Jenell Hilderbrand February 14, 2011 - 9:43 am

   I was recently in Telluride to watch my son compete in a mogul
   competition. I didn’t want to pay for a lift ticket to stand and watch
   all day so I put on my skins and started up to the bottome of Hermit, a
   blue run that is apx 20 minute easy skin up from the mountain village.
   About 5 minutes after the start a ski patroller yelled out to me to
   stop and come down. I skiied down to hiim, he said it was illegal in
   the state of colorado to hike and ski and said I was poaching runs. I
   informed him I didn’t want to pay to stand and watch all day, he
   understood and I took a gondola ride up where he met me on smowmobile
   to drive me to the bottom of the course. I didn’t fight or resist and
   was happy the patroller was willing to work with me. I am very
   interested in the laws in coloardo with hiking and skiing at resorts. I
   am an avid hiker/skinner, and have never out of all the resorts I have
   chosen to hike and ski, been threatened that it was against the law. I
   agree with Lou, laws need to be in place, but when your a spectator at
   an event where your spending money anyway, what is the trouble with
   that????

   Lou February 14, 2011 - 9:48 am

   Someone correct me if I’m wrong, but in Colorado there is no specific
   law about hiking uphill at a ski resort. The laws that cover it are the
   ones that create the Special Use Permit system administered by the
   USFS, which allow the resort to make many of its own rules within its
   permit area. The skier’s safety act also applies, as probably do a few
   other laws… but I don’t know of anything specific to hiking uphill.

   Hiking uphill to spectate ski races is a huge tradition all over the
   planet. For this to be an issue is simply ludicrous.

   Jenell Hilderbrand February 14, 2011 - 9:53 am

   Just for an FYI, I wasn’t hiking to ski, am aware of the safety risks
   and stay to the side of the run, am polite, and if I was on foot w/o
   skiis no one would have said “boo”, there were others hiking and
   snowshoeing. So in conclusion, they need to accomodate uphill hikers,
   like the Aspen/Sunlight area with a dayhiker free pass (it’s all about
   the liability). As a parent of a competitor I spend a lot of money at
   the resort, on lift tickets, lodging, food, gas, etc. So it’s not about
   the skiing for a parent of a competitor, it’s not about out of bounds
   (a big no no), it’s about a lil fresh air, exercise, and fun watching
   the kids compete…….your not skiing when your kid is competeing, your
   watching…I respect Patrol and they are a large part of the ski resort
   for safety, I just think with uphill skinning becoming more popular we
   need to mold the rules to accomodate everyone!

   Jonathan Shefftz February 14, 2011 - 9:55 am

   re CO “law” check out the Breck policy on skinning — plenty of
   restrictions (all clearly written out), but all of them are very
   sensible. The resort even has a phone number to call, updated each day,
   with any special safety concerns for skinners (especially winch cat
   grooming),

   Jenell Hilderbrand February 14, 2011 - 9:57 am

   I tried to check out the rules of uphill at Telluride and couldn’t find
   anything about this subject. I did see it was privately owned and
   operated, does this mean they own the land or lease it?

   Jenell Hilderbrand February 14, 2011 - 10:04 am

   I find it interesting that Telluride has snow tubing at night, but,
   doesn’t allow uphill skinning, hmmm interesting.

   Jenell Hilderbrand February 14, 2011 - 10:11 am

   I also find it interesting that Ski Patrolers and Ski Instructors are
   REQUIRED to wear helmets…..safety?

   Jenell Hilderbrand February 14, 2011 - 10:11 am

   I meant ARE NOT required to wear helmets…

   Lou February 14, 2011 - 10:50 am

   Are they not required to wear at some areas, and not at others?

   As always, it’s always weird to me that helmets are such an issue,
   while blown knees are the actual problem…

   Lou February 14, 2011 - 10:52 am

   snow tubing at night, good example of why the ‘liability’ argument is
   specious. If a resort wants an activity, they figure out a way to do
   it. Lots of examples.

   Jenell Hilderbrand February 14, 2011 - 7:12 pm

   I don’t think there is any requirement for patrollers or instructors to
   wear helmets, but, if they preach safety they need to practice what
   they preach. I think people who rent equipment are required to wear a
   helmet or at least rent one. I don’t wear a helmet when hiking or
   backcountry, but, when skiing fast inbounds I do…….

   colin February 15, 2011 - 2:30 pm

   It sounds like Mr. Fleck found what he was looking for. It’s always
   nice to get arrested in front of your Granddaughter.

   jerimy August 2, 2011 - 9:53 am

   Looks like Roland is pushing for change to allow uphill access on USFS
   lands. Take a few minutes and contact your Congressman!

Avalanche Airbag Backpack – Use One or Not?

   by TheEditors OfWildsnow December 12, 2016
   written by TheEditors OfWildsnow December 12, 2016

     Big thanks to Backcountry Access for sponsoring this avalanche
     education content. Check out the additional plethora of avalanche
     safety resources on their website.

   So, you’re thinking about an avalanche airbag backpack for ski touring
   or other backcountry snowsports?
   Backcountry skiing avalanche airbag backpacks.

   Cick for our airbag backpacks index.

   Avalanche airbag statistics have been available for years now. The
   numbers demonstrate impressive effectiveness at keeping an avalanche
   victim from being buried, which depending on factors such as terrain
   (cliffs?) and the size of the avalanche (trauma?) may result in a
   significantly greater chance of surviving being caught in a slide.

   Nonetheless, the effectiveness of avalanche airbags is frequently
   overstated by media and subject to overconfidence by the public. We
   consumers appear to be making assumptions about increases in safety
   that are over optimistic. See an explanation here.) In this linked
   article, author Bruce Tremper makes a math supported statistical
   argument to the following effect:
   BCA LINK

   ADVERTISEMENT

   Tremper: “…avalanche airbag packs will probably save a little more than
   half of those who would have otherwise have died in an avalanche. They
   will never save all of them because 1 out of 4 will likely die from
   trauma of hitting trees and rocks on the way down and an additional 1
   out of 4 will probably end up in a terrain trap (deep burial), buried
   by a secondary avalanche or caught in an avalanche that does not travel
   far enough for the inverse segregation process to work (larger objects
   rise to the surface)…In terrain with few obstacles, terrain traps,
   sharp transitions and [in] smaller paths, avalanche airbags have the
   potential to save significantly more than half of those who would have
   otherwise died.

   We would add that in smaller avalanches, you many not be entrained in a
   lengthy or large enough flow to instigate the “inverse density” effect
   that allows the airbag to keep you on the avalanche surface.
   Compounding that, in a smaller slide a delay in when you activate the
   airbag can result in very little time until the slide comes to a stop —
   possibly not enough time for the “flotation” effect to occur.

   Conclusion: If you backcountry ski you probably will want to rock an
   airbag backpack, but at the same time you’ll need to continue to refine
   your assessment and judgment skills. If you expect the airbag to make
   up for clueless blundering, think again.

   We won’t go too into the science of how avalanche airbags work but
   basically they rely on the principle of inverse segregation. If you
   shake a bag full of sand and pebbles, the pebbles will rise to the
   surface as they have more volume than the sand grains (this also works
   with a bag of popcorn or or tortilla chips; the big particles work
   their way to the top). Thus, in avalanches, making yourself bigger can
   help keep you on the surface, air bags do that by inflating a
   bag-balloon which increases your size. Technically speaking, you’re not
   really “floated” to the surface of the avalanche, but the effect is
   similar.

   [Airbag-ABS-Released.jpg]

   As opposed to an avalanche beacon which relies on disciplined friends
   to find you and is therefore a passive safety system, airbags are an
   active system that you can purchase and use to increase your personal
   odds of survival.

   To drive the point home, know that the chances of being dug up alive by
   your friends are actually not all that good. In a study by the Swiss
   Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research, 53% of people
   completely buried by avalanches did not survive, while only 4% of those
   who weren’t buried died. Your best bet is to stay on the surface, and
   an air bag provides a significantly better chance of that happening.

   Perhaps the biggest deal with avalanche airbag backpacks is they have a
   cost. They cost you comfort and calories as they weigh significantly
   more than a normal rucksack, they cost time as they need to be
   practiced with, repacked and refilled — and they cost way more coin.
   Thus, you’ve got a cost/benefit ratio you may want to consider for your
   own situation.

   For example, say you’re an extreme alpinist who usually uses skis
   simply as an approach and egress tool, will you carry an extra kilo of
   more of weight just to have an airbag for a bit of skiing after your
   climb? Or, are you truly so strapped financially you’re wondering how
   to buy your next meal? Good judgment and technique trumps all safety
   gear, so the big spend on an airbag is not mandatory.

   Likewise, the weight and hassle of airbag packs may be too high a cost
   if you do much air traveling. Perhaps you’re better off renting at your
   destination, or just not using one and instead allocating your energy
   and finances to good decision making and guide fees.

   Also consider the type of terrain you ski (see Tremper quote above).
   Airbags are most effective in moderately sized avalanche in open
   terrain without trauma inducing features such as trees and cliffs. An
   airbag won’t help you in a huge avalanche that damages you from trauma,
   and it won’t help you in a tiny slide that could bury you in a terrain
   trap before there’s time or opportunity for the “separation effect” to
   keep you on the surface.

   If cost is an issue but you do ski the type of terrain where an airbag
   could be effective, think it through. Many skiers don’t flinch at
   dropping more than $1000 on new skis, boots, and bindings each season,
   so is spending that much (or less) on a safety device really that big a
   deal? Or consider snow tires? You might flinch at the tire store, but
   you still get the new meats and enjoy the feeling of being able to stop
   at an iced intersection without gliding effortlessly to the bumper of
   the garbage truck coming in from your right. In our opinion here at
   Wildsnow.com (with caveats, see below) it is time to set priorities and
   make air bag packs just as important as your beacon/shovel/probe combo
   (indeed, if forced to choose, in many situations you’d actually be
   better off with just the airbag).

     What we’re writing about here is in the NOW, when airbags are
     expensive and complicated. In terms of the future, know we do feel
     avalanche airbag backpacks will eventually achieve a level of
     standardization and efficiency, and lower price, that makes them
     similar to the now ubiquitous and socially mandatory beacon — in
     other words, sporting an avalanche airbag ruck will pretty much be
     status quo.

   Use- All airbag packs have a handle (“trigger”) located on one of the
   shoulder straps for activating the airbag. When in safe terrain or in
   situations such as riding a helicopter, the handle can be stowed out of
   reach to avoid an accidental activation (something to be wary of while
   bushwacking, or even getting gear in our out of an automobile). When
   ready to ski, put the handle in the ready position, and if (God forbid)
   you need to use it, pull on the handle which causes a container full of
   compressed gas to inflate the airbag (or a powerful fan in the case of
   Black Diamond Jetforce).

   In an avalanche, your body and air bag are subjected to tremendous
   forces. In order for the rucksack to not come off you in an avalanche,
   the hip belts use specially “safety” shaped metal buckles, which are
   much more cumbersome than standard plastic buckles but are needed for
   strength. In addition, a leg or crotch loop is supplied to prevent the
   pack from being pulled up over your head. These are a pain to use but
   absolutely necessary. After use, the fabric balloon needs to be
   deflated and repacked, and in the case of gas powered packs you’ll need
   to replace or refill your “tank.”

   Testing and Refilling- When you first get your airbag pack, you should
   perform a test release to familiarize yourself with the process and to
   make sure it works. Ideally, you should do this while wearing
   everything you would wear while skiing (or at least goggles, jacket,
   and your least dexterous pair of gloves or mitts). For extra points do
   your test while skiing on a safe slope. Then, depending on the system
   you have, you will either have to refill or replace the gas cylinder
   (or recharge your battery if you’re using a fan type of system). You
   should test your bag at least once a season to re-familiarize yourself
   with the deployment and to make sure it works — along with checking
   that your bag stowage is being done correctly. We recommend several
   tests a season, good reason for an easily refillable or rechargeable
   system.
   Jetforce airbag is a huge 200 liters that might even function as
   partial head protection.

   Jetforce airbag backpack.

   BCA, Mammut and Snowpulse use a cylinder system with a gauge (not a
   “cartridge,” which is a factory sealed tank) that the user can refill
   with compressed air at certain locations. They recommend using licensed
   retailers, but any paintball shop can do it or any dive shop or fire
   station if you have the correct adaptor. Dive shops require a paintball
   to SCUBA adaptor, while fire stations require a paintball to SCBA
   adaptor. Your home compressor or gas station won’t cut it, you need
   2700-3000psi (varies by manufacturer). We have found some fire stations
   to be very helpful and accommodating, they probably won’t charge you
   anything so be sure to make a donation to keep them happy and always
   call in advance.

   Also, when the cylinder is filled from a compressed gas pump, it will
   get very hot; you must let it cool down and then top off again (gas
   expands when it is hot), a water bath will work for this. After refill,
   the O-ring must be replaced and silicone grease reapplied, then
   everything sealed up again to keep water out. It’s a bit of a ‘DIY’
   project, but very doable if you follow the instructions. We love having
   the freedom to refill when I need and not having to deal with any
   shipping (or the cost of buying cylinders such as Alpride). One other
   thing, regardless of how you get the cylinder filled, there is a two
   step process to attaching it to the pack. The cable that goes to the
   activation handle must be attached to the release pin (don’t
   accidentally pull it out!), and the valve must be attached to the
   plumbing that goes to the air bags. Not difficult, but not as idiot
   proof as ABS.

   Air Travel- Flying with your air bag backpack is not a terribly
   difficult thing in most of the world, provided you notify the airline
   in advance, follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer, carry
   the material safety data sheet and perhaps the relevant airline
   regulations (download off your manufacturer’s website).

   If you’re traveling to/from/within North America, for the most reliable
   results when using a refillable system, bring an empty cylinder with
   the cap removed for inspection, and get a fill at your destination. In
   the case of non-refillable cartridges your best bet is to leave the
   filled bottle at home and acquire another at your destination.
   Nonetheless, stories abound of placing a non-refillable pressurized
   cartridge in your checked bags and it being there when you arrive — but
   not always.

   As of 2014 Europe has specific rules regarding avalanche airbags and
   you can fly European with filled cylinders, though we’re still confused
   as to whether we’re supposed to carry our full cylinders/cartridges in
   checked baggage or in carry-on.

   Fan systems such as Black Diamond Jetforce are no different than
   carrying a laptop computer with a battery, and are said to be allowed
   either as carry-on or checked baggage, though you should make sure
   everything is stowed neatly and safely as any battery does have an
   innate fire hazard.

   Alpride is said to be the most airflight compatible of the compressed
   gas packs because it uses the same type of cylinders as the life jacket
   under your airline seat (need a replacement, just wait till the flight
   attendant isn’t looking!). Still, we’ve been confused as to whether
   we’re supposed to carry the Alpride cylinders attached to the rucksack
   plumbing or as originally blister packs, and whether they should be in
   checked baggage or carry-on.

   In all, it’s tragic the airbag industry as a whole has not done a
   better job of clarifying and simplifying the air travel issue, but
   we’ve seen much improvement so we’re optimistic.

   Studies and Data-There have been several tests of the effectiveness of
   air bag packs, and they are further validated by the substantial
   records of real world accidents. Please take the time to google and
   browse the data for yourself.

   Commenters, suggestions welcome for studies we can link to.
   Unfortunately many of the poorly managed airbag websites remove content
   with no effort to provide redirects, so we end up with broken external
   links. More, we caution against placing too much stock in personal
   accounts that that claim “my airbag saved my life!” Even without an
   airbag, many avalanche victims end up on the snow surface. It’s usually
   (if not always) impossible to determine in individual cases whether a
   person would have been otherwise buried if they’d not been using an
   airbag. News media and marketing people tend to confuse cause with
   results in this case, e.g., “I was wearing SuperSkier brand goggles,
   survived the avalanche, and thus my SuperSkier goggles saved my life!”
   Studies that do rigorous statistical analysis are much more valuable
   than “SuperSkier” types of stories.

   Backcountry Access does a terrific job of keeping their research
   content available. Check it out here.

   Perhaps these things make sense for bold high marking sledders, anxious

   invested a lifetime in acquiring the judgement to avoid avalanches, and
   obsesses over every last gram in order to climb and ski unencumbered,
   airbags seem an absurdity, and this article a sales pitch rather than a
   thoughtful consideration.

   Nick- Thanks for putting this together. If Stewspooner is looking for
   unbiased journalism then I don’t know what he’s doing reading Wild
   Snow. It’s always a wealth of information but there;s definitely a lean
   to it.

   I like many skiers am very intrigued by these packs and assume that the
   weight and cost will come down over time as more companies get
   on-board. I know at least one parter of mine is nearly ready to pull
   the trigger (or should I say cord) and buy one.

   My main concern though is regarding the potential for a victim to go
   further in the slide due to increased float. In Europe and certainly
   parts of the US this may be a small problem when above treeline but for
   us in the PNW with so much skiing below treeline I worry that a victim
   is much more likely to hit something big and fatal if they are carried
   further. Cliffs too become an obvious concern for you guys up in the
   thin, treeless air.

   Now they may in fact not be carried significantly further while wearing
   the air bag but most of the testing doesn’t seem to address this and
   most of the data is from Europe, where trees are less of a factor. I’d
   be curious to see info pertaining to distance traveled with and without
   an airbag to see if this is a valid concern for those of us making most
   of our turns below the trees.

   Stewspooner, what about those of us who fall in between a rad

   obsessive about weight? I’d like to claim I won’t ever get caught in
   avalanche, but I’m humble enough to realize I can’t ever make that sort
   of guarantee. I agree that the weight of these is a little off putting,
   but the advantages for someone like me seem hard to ignore.

   I don’t think people wil get these as an alternative to

   odds, if they screw up.

   I think it is pretty obvious that these things work, and are getting
   more affordable, and it will only be a short matter of time before
   these are as universal as beacons/etc.

   People will still want to avoid avy’s. It isn’t only burial that gets
   you, but if you can have a back-up tool to avoid burial, if it happens,
   why not use it? Sometimes people get buried by factors outside their
   control (ie group above), and then there is nobody to look for you,
   even if all were prepared. Insurance.

   @Ryan
   Good question, and something I’ve wondered about as well. On page 310
   of this study
   (http://www.slf.ch/ueber/mitarbeiter/homepages/schweizj/publications/Ts
   chirky_Schweizer_Avalanche_balloon_ISSW1996.pdf) you can see that all
   the airbag equipped dummies ended up lower on the runout than the
   airbagless dummies. This just shows one avalanche, so it would be
   interesting to see more, as there are many factors that could affect it
   such as slope angle and height, runout angle, etc.

   Having an airbag might keep you on the surface, and maybe provide a
   small amount of trauma protection, but trees can still smash you up.
   Whether or not an airbag will send you into them with more velocity is
   something to wonder about, and I’d be interested to see a study that
   addresses it. Based on that single study, it does appear that with an
   airbag you might go further through the trees and therefore hit more of
   them than without a bag.

   Good to hear the snowmobiler at Jone’s pass made it out ok. I found
   this part interesting considering that the air bag kept him from being
   swept as far as he could have, and off a deadly cliff.
   ‘He was able to swim to the edge of the avalanche, and came to a stop
   after about 100 feet, partly buried under 6 to 18 inches of snow.
   “Below me was a cliff that would have destroyed me, period.”’

   Nick – what is the timing of BCA putting out the Float 40, the larger

   Reply

   Steve December 15, 2010 - 12:22 pm

   I thought it was a great article, but then again, I work at BCA.

   What we’re seeing right now in the ski industry is unprecedented:
   massive backcountry growth driven by the alpine companies who are
   mainly producing fat powder and freeride skis. This has resulted in an
   increase in avalanche courses being taken over the last two years which
   is a good thing. It’s also resulted in some progressive new designs and
   concepts by safety manufacturers.

   In my biased opinion, I think there are a few categories that need to
   be more clearly identified where airbags are applicable:

   1. Slackcountry. This is defined by riding lifts, heading into the
   backcountry, and then cycling back to a chair. No skins are used. This
   is a popular mode of backcountry travel in the Northwest, Canada, and
   Europe. Often the terrain is uncontrolled.

   2. Sidecountry: this is defined by riding lifts and then going out and
   skinning. Popular as well in many places. Uncontrolled terrain.

   3. Backcountry: defined by using skins or boot packing and your own
   power! Uncontrolled terrain.

   4. There are also occasional days at some ski areas in Canada and the
   NW where skiing in bounds with beacon, shovel, probe and partner
   becomes mandatory to access some in-bounds terrain. I have seen this
   first hand at Mt. Baker.

   I think that airbags are appropriate for all of the “categories”
   mentioned above but they do not trump education, beacon, shovel and
   probe, which are mandatory. However, we will see airbags becoming much
   more popular and widely accepted in the next few years.

   Ryan brings up a good point about terrain. The ABS stats are all from
   Europe where people tend to ski in a higher alpine environment and in
   areas that can fan out onto shallow slopes. These are very favorable
   conditions for an airbag, and for surviving an avalanche in general
   (keep in mind all avalanches are different and this is a general
   statement). Thick timber could pose an issue with airbags but there’s
   really no data to prove this yet so everything is speculation. Is it
   better to have an airbag deployed when being carried through trees, or
   not? Tough call. In our first instance where a Float 30 was deployed in
   an avalanche last year, the person came out on top of a ten foot debris
   pile and stopped before he was carried into trees below the slope where
   he was caught. We’ve performed some good tests on “trauma” to the
   actual airbags being hucked off cliffs and things like that with good
   results, but the bottom line is this: continue to choose your terrain
   wisely and do not rely on your safety products to help you make a
   decision. My guess is everyone at this site knows this but I thought I
   should bring it up.

   Happy Holidays and get out in La Nina! Steve

   Thanks for the great review Nick.
   I must make full disclosure in that I work with an affiliate of ABS…
   Regardless, its funny to hear the negative comments about weight and
   cost of these packs… the same things people said about beacons 25 years
   ago! Now anyone travelling in avy terrain without a beacon is
   considered a fool.
   Ryan brings up some great points, but at the end of the day I would
   much rather be in avalanche terrain with an ABS (or other airbag pack)
   than without! Of course avoiding a slide is priority #1, but as the
   link to the Article about the snowmobiler who recently survived a slide
   in CO suggests, even when you think you aren’t in avy terrain, you just
   might be! LIkewise, there is a situation that happened here in BC last
   season (or perhaps the season before) where a ACMG guide was caught in
   a slide on similar low angled terrain, he survived thanks to his airbag
   pack…
   Keep up the great work Wildsnow!

   I have my eyes on that abs powder 15 liter.

   Maybe we could keep this thread on the details of the technology and

   Most of us are way past that point and there’s been plenty of that

   Seems like the only and best solution for the solo skiier when the

   Seems like it could hook into your harness somehow.

   @jim
   an airbag can never become a separate attachment to your own pack since
   you need safety-harness-level on webbing, stainless clips, and crotch
   strap

   what is possible and already here is the base units including harness
   in different sizes (abs vario and abs powder) and then lots of packs in
   different sizes to put on the base unit and change between from day to
   day.

   there are third party abs compatible options from other manufacturers
   like arva, millet and dynastar. soon there is gonna be a LOT to choose
   from.

   @nick
   I think you forgot about the dynastar 28 liter vario compatible in your

   Hopefully these 3rd party companies will jump on the Powder platform

   fact that he is alive, in part to the pack, some good luck, his smarts
   of trying to “swim” to the top, and body armor he was wearing. He was
   very lucky, and knows it, and his pack was one part of the puzzle. Who

   The only drawback to me seems like the possibility of being carried
   farther because of the airbag and increasing the chance of hitting
   something. But that Colorado slide provides some great anecdotal
   evidence that that’s not always the case.

   The airbag brought him to the top, where he could see what needed to be
   done, and it let him swim himself to the side before the cliff.

   Great stuff, Nick.

   It seems to me like ALL the ABS dual-bag packs since 1996 use the same
   cartridge connector?
   So they can all take the new carbon cartridge?
   I’m getting an idea here, why not get any old dual-bag off of german or
   austrian ebay and then do a kai larson custom UL mod on that?

   Even if I was doing it on the vario or the powder base unit, I know
   that heavy big ass zipper would have to go immediately…

   And to all of you who say you can’t afford an airbag:
   ABS bags sell for $300-350 on ebay all the time, check the german
   completed listings.
   And german speaking euros actually speak english.
   Some dislike paypal but they ship abroad if you ask nicely.

   This was just the article I was hoping for. When I read the write-up
   about the mystery ranch pack, I was very skeptical. Nevertheless, it
   planted a seed of insatiable gear lust. Now I’m dying to get one. On
   top of my list right now is the ABS vario. I love the multiple pack
   volume option. The dual bags make it appealing because everyone knows
   that 2 is greater than 1. Finally I tend to trust the manufacture that
   has been at it the longest (for example you can get the tried and true
   dynafit boots or you can buy the newly released solomon boots with tech
   fittings. We all know how that ended.) The biggest downside for the ABS
   for me is the issue of refills. All that shipping could really add up
   (Not that I plan on deploying it very often, if ever).

   Now as for the risk compensation issue: Will owning this pack make me
   stick my neck out a little more. Yup, it actually might. But the way I
   look at it, that just means even more epic descents and deep days. I’m
   failing to see the downside to this.

   Have a look again at those stats.

   Apologies for being such a contrarian, but I can’t help sharing an
   alternate perspective, no matter how unwelcome amongst so many gadget
   lovers. For backcountry skiers, managing risk and the attitudes that
   contribute to poor decisions may not be as satisfying to some as
   shopping, and may require uncomfortable reconsideration of one’s own
   behaviors, but it can be interesting
   and effective (as well as cheap, simple and light weight). Risk
   compensation, where individuals will behave less cautiously in
   situations where they feel more protected, is real, and something I
   would like to see considered more on Wildsnow.

   Nice article Nick, good information. The avalanche airbag pack is the
   only real safety device. The only true safety is staying out of
   avalanches.

   Funny how it seems OK many places to discuss endless fascination with
   transceivers and shovels- last time I studied it gave overall a 10%
   increase in survival of completely buried victims! Compare that to
   high-90th percentile success figures with avalanche airbag use in
   avalanches.

   Wildsnow is one of the few sources of information and opinion that has
   a realistic approach to avalanche avoidance and in the futility of
   transceiver-partner rescue.

   In regard to judging avalanche potential, get it right or die, and I
   wear my ABS for the time that I get it wrong!

   per year I got a snowpulse air bag three years ago. LAST SPRING IT
   SAVED MY LIFE!!. Anybody who thinks they know it all and will never be

   years of training and experience have been caught. The first avi death
   this year was a pro patriler. One of my friends has a calous saying…all
   the avi experts are dead. I attended an avi seminar this fall and the
   forecasters stressed predicting avalanches is an art not science. One
   speaker had been with search and rescue for 30 years and dug up 32 dead
   bodies. He had been in an avalanche himself years ago. He endorsed
   airbags and said he would not ski without one. The only time I will
   ever ski without my snowpulse is in the summer on a consolidated snow
   pack. Save money and weight some place else .An airbag is worth its
   weight in gold and much lighter!!

   Hi,
   first to be a bit patriotic and wise: ABS is a German company and thus
   the packs are developed and made in Germany. No offense 😉

   Now the interesting part:
   you stated that the metal hip belt buckles are “much more cumbersome
   than standard plastic buckles”. The new base units that came out this
   year have a newly designed metal buckle which are a lot easier to use.
   The smaller part of the buckle now slides through the bigger part much
   easier since the bigger part has small notches on either side. The
   smaller bit now does not have to be maneuvered through the eye as
   difficult as before.
   Furthermore, the redesign includes another change which allows to open
   the buckle a lot easier. The bigger part of the buckle has a wave
   design on one front so you can easily lift the smaller part up with

   Another benefit of a metal buckle for general us is it does not break.

   after my last post on the technical side I have to now also state a few
   points regarding the whole discussion on opinion and should you wear an
   airbag or not:

   first, I also have to say what zoom says. all the people that have been
   caught and would now invest in an airbag are not here to state this
   change in mind.
   avis are just unpredictable and all the things you learn from classes
   and literature and experience might be worth nothing in that one
   situation. this means:

   if you have to, go get a loan for it and you will have ca. 97% ability
   to pay back the loan. better than being dead with $1G extra in the
   bank…

   Another point on the purchase. these items are very stable in value and
   as aviator stated you can get them on European ebay very easy. I am
   German myself and can tell you that you can get a new one every 2 years
   and be able to recover almost 80% of the purchase price each time.

   now a little experience report:
   we go skiing with a group of people all equipped with the standard
   beacon, probe & shovel set up and additionally an ABS. we are all very
   considerate of the avalanche/ snow pack situation and well educated on
   snow science and risk reduction strategies.
   nevertheless, one of us got caught ca. 2 years back in a slope where a
   few people have skied down before that day (7th skier syndrome).
   he released the airbag and survived. only his tele boot was broken in
   the bellows and his skies were gone.

   bottom line:
   IT DOES WORK and THERE IS NOT GOOD REASON NOT TO HAVE ONE ONCE YOU
   REALIZE THIS AND GO OUT OF BOUNDS REGULARLY!!!

   @stew-People will need to be careful in watching how their acceptable
   risk can change. I have felt it myself with these airbags, and fight
   with myself to understand that I could still die and must not consider
   the airbag a guarantee. All safety equipment can cause this, and it is
   up to the individual to not kid themselves.

   @Rocco- Thanks for the clarifications. I was aware that ABS (and
   Snowpulse) have redesigned their buckles since the packs that I have,
   and look forward to testing them. Good to hear that they are easier to
   use!

   @Nick- I believe the larger Float42 should be out next season. Steve?

   I recently bought a BCA Float 30, but can fully relate to Stewspooners
   point. Between this and all of the other gear that is considered
   “mandatory” nowadays, ie beacon, shovel, probe, helmet, cell phone,
   Avalung, etc., the sport is definitely getting heavier and more
   expensive, but statistically not that much safer. The other day as I
   was unzipping the trigger handle and making sure it was ready to go, it
   occurred to me that if I wasn’t wearing my airbag pack I would be
   skiing a safer, more conservative line. There is a lot to be said for
   using your brain instead of just relying on gear.

   Lou December 16, 2010 - 10:29 am

   Good point Andrew, I did notice over the past couple of decades that I
   do carry a lot more junk than I did way back when. My pack is about the
   same weight because the weight of everything except water has been
   significantly reduced, but wow, what lot of stuff… by choice, of
   course. Multi-use items are still the solution to much of this, wish
   we’d see more of that. Can I use my airbag backpack as a pillow?

   Andrew December 16, 2010 - 10:38 am

   Really? What did you use to carry in your pack that was so heavy? I
   suspect that a) your pack is actually way heavier nowadays and b) that
   your tours are shorter (sled access not included). I know this is true
   in my case and I think the root cause of it is death by 1,000 ounces.

   Don’t understand… if you’re wondering why my backpack 35 years ago was
   similar weight to these days even though it had fewer items it was
   probably all the wool clothing and heavier repair kit, for starters. My
   tours are most certiainly shorter and steeper, as I started more as a
   slogger when it came to backcountry skiing. But then, perhaps I’m
   imagining things and my pack is heavier these days, though I just don’t
   feel that is the case. No way of knowing for sure, really…

   According the link to the study in Switzerland, these devices work well

   While avalanche bags do seem like they could be a good idea, they have
   their limitations.

   @Jim, even if we assume–for the sake of argument–that the airbag makes
   avalanche deaths a low probability–solo backcountry skiing doesn’t
   become that much safer–if they get injured, there may not be anyone to
   help them.

   Lou December 16, 2010 - 11:31 am

   Safety through good judgment and risk management is so all fired
   important, but so dang hard to measure and quantify. I’m certain I go
   out tons of days where I’d be fine without a partner, beacon, or
   shovel, but how to know which days those are? Instead, I always carry
   the minimum I think I’d need for a worst case event, except during
   spring tours when I might eliminate a few items, but not much. I have
   to say that after years of messing around with communication options, I
   feel super fortunate to be able to carry a sat phone, as we’ve got some
   really eager and quick rescue folks available now. But yeah, weather
   comes in or an injury is really bad, communication isn’t much help and
   unfortunately nothing else is either. And nothing works perfectly.
   Beacons even fail, I’ve had it happen. Will that airbag deploy when you
   yank the trigger? Will your Spot Messenger work in those dense trees
   where you’re stuck with a broken leg? Hmmmmm…

   Nick T December 16, 2010 - 11:40 am

   @Louis- Yes a limitation of airbags is that they only work when in
   flowing debris. If the debris you are in stops moving, the buoyancy
   effect ends. This explains some of the deaths that have occurred with
   air bags- the slide stops with the victim on the surface but then a
   second slide comes and buries them. Terrain traps could cause a similar
   situation.

   Louis December 16, 2010 - 11:43 am

   Risk-shift is a real, though sometimes overstated, problem. However, I
   fail to see the point of carrying 1/2 or even 1/3 of your body
   weight–with certain exceptions– merely for a day trip. Obviously, carry
   1/3-1/2 of your body weight is unlikely scenario–the the more important
   point is that tou can carry as much stuff as you like, but you will
   never completely eliminate all of the risks inherent in backcountry
   travel.

   Carrying too much stuff can create more problems than it solves. The
   consequences of not carrying enough stuff are self-explanatory. There
   are always trade offs here. While I’m not suggesting that merely having
   an avalanche airbag will push you over the weight threshold, I do think
   that the growing trend of heavier packs–if continued–could backfire.

   Great article with lots of interesting insight. Just wanted to
   highlight two things

   1) One needs to do everything to AVOID an avalanche in the first place.
   With the increasing popularity of backcountry skiing we see all sorts
   of dangerous behaviour off piste and there are simple steps to minimise
   the danger of causing an avalanche.

   2) The airbag only works if you can reach the handle and rip the cord.
   I’ve talked to a lot of mountain rescue folks and if caught in an
   avalanche, there’s usually very little time to do anything, let alone
   think to pull the handle of your airbag or even physically get your
   hand to your shoulder. So if in doubt, pull it while you can.

   Also the cause of death in many avalanches is from trauma, ie broken
   necks as well as from asphyxiation (double death?) so the product that
   goes around your head might be better suited to prevent that.

   Don’t get me wrong, I ski with an airbag and the other safety gear but
   avoiding an avalanche situation is always the first thing on my mind,
   not relying on potential safety measures to get OUT of one.

   Enjoy the season fellas.

   I can see the point of an airbag for those who are fortunate enough to
   be able to ski 100 days a year. For us mere mortals whose schedules
   rarely allow for more than 20-30 days a year, is it worth getting one,
   or just keeping the standard beacon and shovel?
   Reply

   Frank K December 16, 2010 - 1:24 pm

   Thanks for the informative post. Personally, I think I’ll wait another
   year or two, as I suspect other pack manufacturers will also join in
   with their own offerings, hopefully ones which are lighter and cheaper
   to boot.

   A question for those in the know: Do airbags also tend to orient the
   person wearing it in a head-up/feet-down position? Granted, a big slide
   will push you all over the place, but I’m curious if the bags have some
   tendency do keep your head up (and, by extension, not be the first part
   of your body to hit a tree)

   Lee Lau December 16, 2010 - 1:52 pm

   I thought about emailing Stew but will put it out here in public.

   I totally agree with him. I actually bought an ABS pack for a good
   price ($80) and tried it on one tour. The pack was so heavy, so poorly
   made, so poorly thought out from the perspective of being a backpack
   that I couldn’t see myself using it. My thoughts were (feel free to
   criticize as I am putting them out in the open), if a piece of gear is
   bad that I don’t want to use it and am really reluctant to go out with
   it, that piece of gear will then be useless for me, because I will
   probably not want to take it out on tours. This applies even if that
   piece of gear is a useful safety device

   By the way this was an older ABS pack; probably a few generations
   older. I had the pressure on the canisters checked and sold it for the
   same price I bought to someone else who was willing to put up with the
   pack’s deficiencies.

   Having said all that, this is a useful article. I’d like to see someone
   make a simple backpack that happens to incorporate flotation devices.
   Of course, good being highly subjective in that I want simple and light
   (while acknowledging that the flotation component will add weight) and
   don’t want useless doodads and flapping accoutrements. I know that’ll
   be a tall order as simple backpacks seem to not be that popular.

   @Lee- Which model did you have? I bought an older (discontinued) ABS
   Escape 50 a couple years ago, and wasn’t at all impressed with it as a
   backpack at first. However, I forced myself to use it and have grown to
   be happy with it. I’d of course be a lot happier if it were lighter,
   simpler, carried better, and had a better ski carry system. I’ve held
   off on making any mods in the interest of selling it for an upgrade at
   some point. I manufacturers will get better, especially as more
   interest from skiers is generated. Right now, most of their sales are
   going to snowmobilers, so that drives the market. (We largely have
   snowmobilers to thank for the increased US presence)

   Randonnee December 16, 2010 - 3:04 pm

   Great discussion! One point for this debate is that one must reflect
   that by choosing to go into the mountains to ski mountaineer or
   skitour, we are adding risk to our life. We add the risk of dying in
   several types of accidents that would cause trauma or asphyxiation. It
   is naive to assume successful rescue or even partner rescue! We all
   hope for that, but one must embrace the reality! We will not eliminate
   this risk by using gadgets.We best control it by careful consideration
   and self-discipline.

   A second point about weight- I feel that the weight and hassle of my
   transceiver is a fairly useless burden. And yes, I am acquainted with
   two guys that I have skied with who have rescued and been rescued by
   transceiver without injury. If caught, one will still be entrained and
   will be subject to trauma from the forces of an avalanche. Unless one
   of my former Pro-Patrol colleagues is with me, I do not expect rescue
   from other folks until at least anoxic brain injury has occured or
   death, and this is aside from terrible potential trauma to be incurred!
   Read the accounts and statistics- the wonderful transceiver rescues are
   the exception, not the rule! One survives that by luck or for me by the
   Grace of God!

   Six years lugging my ABS and I have done nothing while wearing it that
   I would have done without it. Why take a risk- it is a mechanical
   device that may fail. However, in the two avalanches that I have ridden
   in 30 years I could have easily pulled the handle and deployed the ABS.
   One of those avalanches was unexpected, and that is the reason that I
   like to lug my ABS around.

   Since I am a big guy the weight is not as significant, although on a
   couple of tours it has been tiring. My weight runs 225 to 235, and this
   year is on the low end so that little weight loss accounts for more
   then the ABS weight in my case!

   Want to echo Scott Davenport’s comment. Wonderful post. As usual
   Wildsnow timely with the info on the new stuff coming to market.

   I like most people think the Avalanche bag will become standard
   equipment for backcountry skiing. The problem is the expense and
   weight. Now that there are 4 to 5 players in the market are we going to
   start seeing these things being made for the backcountry tourers and
   not just the heli ops, european off piste guides that don’t tend to
   have long vertical approaches and snowmobilers that don’t care about
   weight.

   If I buy one now for a grand, are they going to be lighter and cheaper
   next year. Probably, but then where does that leave me now…… hmm tough
   one.

   Here are some more things to throw into the mix- by the way this
   discussion has been great.

   By now everybody knows that there are basically two different canisters
   out there- nitrogen (ABS) and compressed air everybody else. The
   release systems actually work in different ways.

   The compressed air packs either work by a puncturing a disk with a
   needle like aparatus or by opening valve when you pull the activator.

   The ABS System is a bit different. Most are unaware that it uses an
   explosive charge. When you pull the activator you cause a canister to
   explode and that creates a high pressure through the line that
   punctures the nitrogen canister.
   Here is an exert from the ABS manual.

   “Release System
   The release system is made up of the pressure hoses with the golden
   shaft and the white release handle. The release handle is equipped with
   a release cartridge by the manufacturer. The release cartridge explodes
   when then handle is pulled and the resulting air pressure triggers the
   puncture of the nitrogen cartridge.”

   This is also of interest because the process to release compressed air
   canisters is a two part process: (1) pull the activator (2) open valve
   or puncture disk. For the ABS System it is a three part process: (1)
   pull the activator (2) activate release cartridge (3) pressurized air
   punctures canister.

   aviator December 16, 2010 - 5:50 pm

   Thanks Patrick for all the details,

   How does the remote release work on the Mystery Ranch?
   It must use some kind of exploding release right?

   I read somewhere the reasons ABS uses nitrogen instead of air is less
   volume, less weight and less problems with freezing.
   Any thoughts on that?

   There must be patents on a lot of the ABS stuff since they were first?
   Nitrogen system?
   Carbon cartridge?
   Dual-bag system?
   Pack bases with different zip on bags?

   interested and hopefully thoughtful, experienced folk. With that in
   mind maybe here’s an opportunity to talk about what we’d like to see
   from our ideal BC pack of the future since so much of this conversation
   is about how the packs suck and less about whether to bag or not to
   bag.

   Here’s a start: Maybe two size options and my guess is enough of us
   would want BD to make it so we could incorporate an Avalung into it.

   Something that could carry skis in both A-frame and Diagonally as well
   as a snowboard vertically. They’d need to market this to a broad
   audience to justify it.

   Helmet storage capability as this is an uber-safe customer.

   Keep the fabric weight light and durable. We’re willing to pay for it.

   What else would you like to see?
   Reply

   Patrick Odenbeck December 16, 2010 - 6:30 pm

   @ aviator

   No explosion is part of the system. Mystery Ranch uses a puncture
   system. When you pull the activator a needle punctures a disc on the
   compressed air cartridge, air flows into the bag and additional air is
   brought in through the venturi inflating the airbag.

   I have not heard of any differences with freezing problems between the
   systems. There might be but they would be at temps that people probably
   would not want to be skiing in- like well below -30 F ambient.

   Everybody has patents on their system to protect it mostly on the way
   the system activates. The interesting thing is that the ABS system
   never really had any pressure from anyone else till recently. Pretty
   cool because it is all a different way to solve a problem.

   We (Mystery Ranch) are in the game because not only are we avid
   packmakers but skiers as well who actually use the designs. We make
   them and test them and we are very picky, the Blackjack went through
   many prototypes and the end result is a really special piece of gear-
   it is just so versatile. We are psyched to be working with Avi Vest
   because the system is just so simple and elegant.

   If you really want some more info about differences in the systems out

   why do we need a combined airbag/avalung?

   Hey Nick, great article; lots of great information, much of which can
   be tricky to track down. Thanks! Take the rest of the week off…

   I do, however, want to raise some concerns about the statistic that 97%
   of avalanche victims with airbags survive. Everyone cites it, but I
   think it’s misleading at best. The problem is that it doesn’t matter
   how many airbag-wearing avy victims survived slides, what matter is how
   many of these people survived WHO WOULD HAVE DIED IF THEY HAD NOT HAD
   AN AVY PACK (sorry for the shouting). I took a look at the data, and I
   concluded that these packs are much less life-saving than they might
   appear based on the 97% statistic. The biggest reason is that a
   surprisingly large percentage of people caught in avalanches without
   airbags are not completely buried, and in Switzerland, almost everyone
   who isn’t completely buried lives (caveat 1: please, several someones,
   check the following math; I am very much practicing statistics without
   a license).

   Analysis:
   The key question is:, what is the likelihood that an avy victim with no
   airbag who died would have lived had they had an airbag? The 97%
   statistic comes from Jahrbuch 2002 (Analysis of all recorded Swiss Avy
   accidents, 1981-1998). It breaks out burial and survival data for
   airbag users, and finds 40 airbag victims, one of whom died. Hence, 97%
   lived. To find out how many of those would have lived anyway (macabre,
   I’ll admit), requires some more digging.

   From the SFR study (which Nick linked to; all recorded Swiss avy
   accidents from 1980-1999) I get the following information:
   -Out of all victims, about 96% who were unburied or partially buried
   lived and 50% who were completely buried lived.
   -Out of all victims, 62% were not or were partly buried, and 38% were
   completely buried. (these %’s are conservative, in favor of the avy
   packs. They are for reported incidents. The report estimates a 75/25
   split when unreported are factored in).
   From Jahrbuch, I get the following:
   -83% of airbag wearers caught in slides were not buried or were partly
   buried.
   -17 % of airbag wearers caught in slides were completely buried.
   Assuming that 50% of people who are completely buried die, regardless
   of whether or not they have an airbag (see caveat below), I added
   everything up to get:
   -(4% of 83%)+(50% 0f 17%)= 11.8% chance one of these Swiss people would
   have died had they been caught in an avalanche while wearing an airbag
   pack.
   -(4% of 62%)+(50% of 38%)= 15.5% chance one of these Swiss people would
   have died had they been caught in a slide without an airbag pack.

   Conclusions and Caveats
   Based on the data I found in 15 min (always an effective basis for a
   study), airbag packs don’t provide nearly the level of safety the 97%
   stat seems to convey. However, please note that:
   -The airbag stats are from a pretty small sample size of 40 incidents.
   The reasons the survival rate is so high in the study is that because
   the sample size is so small, the number of complete burials is REALLY
   small (6) and only one of those died, far below the average of 50%. I
   think it’s unlikely that an avy bag offers much chance of increased
   survival other than keeping you on the surface, so I believe the 50%
   figure. However, if you want to hang your hat on a 1 out of 6 result,
   be my guest.
   -These data may not be all that applicable to your situation. The Alps
   are weird (just look at all that spandex). According to Tremper, 25% of
   US victims were killed by trauma, compared to 50 % in Canada (what
   gives, I thought you guys cut down all your trees? Are these from
   rocks? moose?), but only 6% in the Alps. That means that staying on the
   surface is far more valuable in Europe than in North America, and
   therefore airbags should be less valuable in NA. Unless your local
   terrain is Alp-like, of course. This basic idea seems to be pretty
   common knowledge, but that’s a pretty big difference.
   -I have a lot of questions regarding how representative the airbag
   population in this study is. After all, we’re using these people to
   understand how safety would improve if the entire BC ski population
   wore packs. Were they more likely to be guided, which might inflate
   (ha!) the airbags’ safety numbers due to competent group-mates? Or were
   they more likely to ski radder, more dangerous terrain, which might
   skew the data towards the packs seeming to provide less safety than
   they really do?
   -Avy accident data is pretty poor in general. Mostly because the slides
   that get reported tend to be the ones that kill or injure people.
   Generalizations can be hard. The SFR study estimates that roughly 50%
   of slides went unreported. That leaves the possibility of serious skews
   in the data.
   -BC skiers often talk about risk separately from consequences, but
   given that the consequences in skiing are often literally life and
   death, it’s important to remember what is at stake. It’s tempting to
   look at 16% vs 12% and say that that’s not worth 700$ and 8 lbs, but
   that’s four people out of 100 who would have made it home to their
   families given an avy pack. Given the length of the study, that’s
   something like 60 people. Alive. Those odds may be worth the cost to
   you.

   Hope that’s useful, and boy is it going to be funny if I made a math
   mistake 40,000 words ago. Just kill me now. Also stay tuned, I’ll be
   taking up a collection to get Lou back he 10 hours of his life he’ll
   never get back after moderating this.

   Finally, my favorite part of the linked study is that they took the
   time to report that 100% of the people who self-rescued (not companion
   rescue) were still alive after the slide. You think? 🙄 Although a part
   of me hopes that TGR will put out a flick on the self-rescued undead.
   Could be killer…

   PS. Okay, actual favorite stat: everyone caught in an avalanche with an
   avy bag that didn’t inflate…lived. So forget that expensive dyneema,
   Lou. Just remove the cylinder! Lightweight AND safe.

   Pretty good there Matt, and laughing out loud! I’m not sure the numbers
   are as misleading as you say they are, and the testing they’ve done
   over the years is pretty convincing as well, showing that nearly
   everyone who inflates an airbag in an avy will end up not buried unless
   it’s a terrain trap situation. Not getting buried is the key, anything
   that keeps you from getting buried is key to survival — chance, or an
   airbag.

   I think your best point is to emphasize the difference between Euro and
   North American trauma rates. Common wisdom holds that’s because people
   simply do less tree skiing in EU, not only because cable access gets
   them vast amounts of alpine terrain, but also because even the lower
   elevation ski touring is frequently done in agricultural areas where
   hundreds of years of forestry and grazing have created vast amounts of
   open area. That’s very unlike the western U.S. and Canada, where we
   still ski in or above what is essentially boreal forest that’s even
   more dense and overgrown than is natural, due to fire suppression and
   much less logging than the same areas would have in more populated
   areas of Europe where the forest is essentially “farmed” for biomass
   and lumber production..

   But yeah, perhaps our resident statistician will get a bug tickling his
   behind when he sees your comment, and try to beat your word count

   A quick bit of data gleaned from issw this year is that there is an
   attribution toward snow density (S.W.E.) affecting survival rate that
   may describe the difference between US and Canadian avalanche trauma
   fatalities. The Euro rate is strongly influenced by terrain as noted
   previously. I realize I’m out on a limb without specific source
   citation here but i will search a bit and find more substantiation if
   someone else doesn’t piggyback this comment with more data.
   My 2 cents on airbags is that they can be a great tool in small soft
   slab avalanches with clean run outs. We still succumb to the whims of
   physics when you throw in rapid stop trauma from trees, rocks etc. and
   our soft gushy bodies are no match for the sausage grinder of a hard
   slab release, especially class 2 and larger events. Probably better to
   first drop the cash on education and supporting your local avalanche
   center. Better to avoid an avalanche than depend on technology to bail
   your ass out.

   I thinking all this through quite a bit the last few days, as we’ve got

   course. (He’d be using the Float, but the waist belt was too big for
   his skinny rear end so we’ve got to re-sew it and haven’t gotten around
   to it). Yeah, it is just so important not to get caught in the first
   place, but even though I’m a huge proponent of that POV, I still get
   sucked into thinking all this junk is pretty likely to save me, when in
   reality, thinking about the kind of terrain we ski here in Colorado,
   that’s probably not the case.

   That being said, if my son is out there with the full compliment of

   @lou
   I think I wore Jonathan out in the mystery ranch announcement thread:

   As I said there, focusing on the most interesting numbers only:

   SURVIVAL RATES COMPLETELY BURIED:
   w airbag 24/31 77%
   w/o airbag 12/29 41%

   http://abs-airbag.com/doc2.php?id=30&tblname=us_down&iname=dwid&lang=us

   Even the ones without airbag were still in groups where others wore
   airbags, those 41% are WAY better than in groups where no one is
   wearing them. “Normal” survival rates completely buried in those groups
   are shockingly low, less than 10%? Jonathan? These numbers are what
   makes me get and wear an airbag NOW, even if it would cost $10000 and
   weigh 10lbs.

   I guess my thought that this thread could stay on topic, product
   comparison and technology, cause we all agree on getting airbags now
   was naive. So many people in here stuck in 1987 on to wear or not to
   wear…. 8)

   Aviator- Regarding trees and rocks, many slides aren’t deep enough to
   fully bury a victim so its not always a question of whether or not you
   get buried but also a question of how far do you travel with the slide
   and what to you encounter along the way (trees, cliffs, rocks).
   Considering the only study cited here shows that a person dummy wearing
   an avy bag is likely to travel farther in a slide than one not wearing
   one I feel like in terrain where physical trauma is as much a factor in
   surviving as burial is that avy bags are not all you guys are blowing
   them up to be.

   To put it very simply, if I’m in heavy trees or cliffs and I think any
   slide is likely to be fairly shallow due to safer snow below or I’m
   just concerned about sluffing then one could argue that deploying an
   avy bag in a slide is more dangerous than not. If I’m going to travel a
   good deal further with it I’m that much more likely to hit something or
   go over a cliff.

   Don’t get me wrong, I’m a fan of these things and they seem like a
   pretty good idea, I just think the evidence we have here is not taking
   a world of factors into account. Matt’s comments hit the nail on the
   head (Thanks Matt) that we’re infering way too much from way too
   little. No study is going to be able to accurately reflect this but the
   bottom line is how many people would have died or been injured had they
   not been wearing an avy bag and the number is going to be much smaller
   than 97%.

   Also no Avy bag manufacturer is going to do a study and publish it on
   the effects of avy bags in relation to trauma incurred when skiing
   below treeline. Until we have a large sample set of data under these
   circumstances to pull from you’re comparing apples to oranges or at
   least you are if you ski in treed areas.

   Maybe an article compiling all the avy bag specs in one place is not
   the best place to debate their merits but I think for some of us the
   jury is still out and to say unequivocally that avy bags are the
   greatest and everyone who doesn’t use one is living in 1987 is a bit of
   a stretch.

   @ aviator
   you have posed a false choice. i don’t feel it is safer to be buried OR
   smash into rocks.
   i’m just sayin’ there is no panacea. the best avalanche tool we have is
   our brain, don’t substitute that with technology and ski things you
   wouldn’t feel good about otherwise (screw the propagating q1 shears and
   recent activity i’ve got an airbag, or helmet, or a new digi beacon
   with altimeter, heart rate monitor and mp3 player). An airbag is a tool
   that provides an advantage in a window of instances. in the handful of
   avalanche fatalities i’ve worked, all were dead or the better part of
   the way there before the slide stopped moving. high neck fractures,
   blunt force, multi system traumas that an airbag would not have done
   shit for ( neither would a beacon, helmet, partner, or body armor). buy
   all the tools you want, the best thing you got going is shaping
   yourself into the best decision maker you can be before you even click
   in.

   do i think a level 2 course is a better buy than an airbag? Yes. Do I
   think researchers and forecasters have provided us with far more
   lifesaving potential through knowledge than the industry’s gadgets?
   Yes.

   Sure, you have a point, there are situations where you might not choose
   to deploy an airbag. (Even though I think it’s VERY hard to determine
   in a split second if it is gonna be shallow enough to take that
   chance.)
   But how does that translate into not buy/wear one at all?
   Are you saying you ONLY ski terrain where you wouldn’t wanna deploy
   one?

   @goatwhisperer
   Why is an airbag and other safety measures always mutually exclusive?
   No one here said it can substitute anything else?
   Why wouldn’t we continue taking courses, focus hard on weather and make
   safe decisions? Why do we have to turn into idiots and forget
   everything we know when we put one on? Why wouldn’t we still know that
   getting caught has to be avoided no matter what? We don’t leave our
   shovel or first aid kit at home so we can stay more alert and make
   safer choices?

   I agree, that 97% doesn’t say much. But like I said , there are some
   very interesting numbers in those ABS reports, mainly the full burial
   survival rates.

   2. Are you still wearing your avalung?

   @aviator
   Thanks for tracking down some more data, it can only help. At first
   glance I wonder if that 24 out of 31 stat is statistically significant
   from the 16 out of 31 deaths you would expect with no airbag. That’s
   not a tiny sample size, but it’s not great, given that the difference
   is only eight deaths.

   However, I think you raise a great point (possibly THE key point): that
   airbags will have a much bigger safety impact if they not only keep
   more people from being buried, but also increase the survival rate for
   people even if they are buried. The reports I read didn’t really offer
   enough data to be conclusive, but there are certainly conceptual
   reasons to think that that might occur. My calcs assume that being
   buried is the only thing that matters, not whether or not you are
   buried with an airbag.

   What shocked me was that these studies suggest that a much higher
   percentage of slide victims (up to 75%) than I thought are not
   completely buried. As a result, the data suggest that avalanche bags DO
   keep you on the surface more often (80-90% of the time), but that
   that’s not that many more than would be expected without a bag.
   Although again, it’s still an improvement.

   @Lou
   I think poor Jonathan is having trouble seeing his screen through the
   tears after reviewing my math. Would love to have his (or anyone’s)
   input on the calcs. Oh, and you ARE paying us by the word, right? 😉 My

   I’m deeply troubled that you all let my Canada stereotyping/bashing
   slide (ha!). You should be ashamed of yourselves. What would your
   mothers think?…(I mean, other than “who is this Matt S, and is he as
   ruggedly handsome as his writing suggests?”)

   Also, I would be curious for someone to do this sort of analysis (but
   better) regarding beacons (if it isn’t out there already). Tricky
   because I’m sure the average beacon user is much more knowledgeable
   about avalanches than the average non-user. I would look at it, but if
   I don’t finish this paper by Monday night, Ryan will make me his avy
   poodle (rendering moot the question of him getting an airbag). I
   eagerly await the research that says that to maximize safety, we should
   all ski naked, in flippers, carrying nothing but bbq tongs and an avy
   probe. (wait, is this mic on?…)

   Oh, and I did just catch one mistake: I forgot to pull the airbag data
   out of the general data (reason number 437 why history majors should be
   kept separate from the numbers). I don’t think it affects my conclusion
   much, because I assumed a lower % of avy victims remaining unburied
   than the study concluded (62% as opposed to 75%), but it might.

   I really never intended to imply mutual exclusivity of any rescue set

   certainly heard directly (not from you) that the avalanche bag is like
   the “hand of god” coming to pluck us from harm. (the tool is only as
   useful as the craftsman) There is an attitude present whenever new tech
   moves happen that they will remove all obstacles and implicit fear and
   we can really start to give ‘er. As long as we are skiing in slide
   paths, avalanches will be there and I don’t see away to reach the
   “nine- nines” of certainty concerning stability or safety. such is
   life, and thank Ullr we will never have dinseyland in the mountains.

   @Aviator
   Sorry, I did just sort of throw that out there (how all my best
   arguments are made). The 16 out of 31 number comes from applying the
   figures I found (50% of burials survive) to the numbers you found (24
   out of 31 survive, if they have an airbag) to make 16/31 (50%). My
   point is that 77% looks much more impressive than 50% on paper, but it
   may actually be a meaningless, or at least less meaningful, distinction
   given the sample sizes involved. My larger point is that I don’t think
   the available data on whether airbags improve safety are as meaningful
   and definitive as many people seem to believe.

   I liked your point because you highlighted a key area of uncertainty:
   even if my original calculations are both correct and applicable, they
   assume that airbags only improve safety if they keep you on the
   surface. I just couldn’t find a large enough sample size (not that many
   people have been buried wearing airbags) to convince me to assume
   anything else. However, if in fact airbags do improve survival rates
   even if the victim is buried, that could dramatically improve the
   packs’ safety benefits. There are reasons to theorize that that might
   be the case, but again, I didn’t see any good actual…you know…proof.

   Another avalanche airbag save story. Here is a news story about a
   British couple caught in an avalanche in France. The wife deployed her
   avalanche airbag and lived, the husband found by transceiver was dead-

   With all of the complaining about weight and the avalanche airbag pack,
   perhaps one would be better off getting rid of the transceiver weight
   and wearing the ABS? Not really, but a dramatization of the point
   anyway. When I tour alone (gasp!) and ski cut then ski avalanche paths,
   I wear my ABS but I leave the transceiver at the car unless I know that
   others will be in the area. That is mainly because if needed I should
   be able to try to rescue someone else.

   All of this effort, interest, and expense directed at gadgets and
   shovel/ probe-size fascination is just marketing-induced toy/
   hero-dream hysteria.

   In regard to avalanches, get it right or die and for the day I get it
   wrong I wear my ABS. :”The avalanche does not care that you are an

   The Powder line could certainly be expanded, but as is mentioned in the
   Powder 15 review ( http://www.wildsnow.com/4408/abs-powder15-firstlook/
   ), it has a small back length and therefore may be uncomfortable with a
   bigger zip on for taller people. That’s just conjecture, however.
   I’ve heard the possibility of ABS partnering with other manufacturers
   to make a pack tailored to the North American market (Bombardier,
   Cilogear??), but we’ll have to just wait and see.
   Anyone who just came in, I just did an update of the chart with some
   verified weights. At some point I need to update this to include
   Mammut, who will be licensing Snowpulse’s new R.A.S system, which is
   basically a removable air bag system.

   I bought my ABS three years ago and urged everyone I ski with to get

   2 of my friends here in Norway bought their ABS packs last year and I
   am glad they did.
   They got caught up in an big avlanche last year and the ABS saved their
   lives. The 21 year old girl that was with them, was not so lucky.
   She did not have an ABS and got buried 6 foot deep. They located her
   quickly (beacon) but she was buried too long and died.

   I wish I could have convinced her to get one too.

   Thank you for the informative article. I live in Western Canada and ski
   in Alberta and BC. I was talking to a very experience bc ski touring
   lodge owner and guide at the Banff film festival a few weeks ago and
   his lodge provides ABS packs for all his quests. His comment was that
   many of the other avi pack systems have had documented cases of the
   packs failing to inflate when the cord was pulled, but this was not the
   case with the ABS packs. Does anyone have any experience or even better
   stats on failure to inflate occurring. ABS is the only one that has
   canisters you must buy and can’t refill yourself so maybe not properly
   refilling the canisters etc account for some of the failure to inflate
   situations he was referring to. I am definitely going to purchase an
   airbag system just trying to decide which one. I was leaning towards
   ABS or the snowpulse system. BCA is attractive with the lower price
   point, but the guide I talked to mentioned BCA specifically having
   documented cases of the airbag failing to inflate. He was not a fan of
   the quality of BCA’s gear in general, so there may be a bias there as
   well.

   Also when I BC ski I always were a helmet as I do at resorts as well to
   help reduce the risk of head trauma. Is there any evidence the
   snowpulse system that wraps around the users head helps decrease the
   risk of head and neck trauma?

   Thanks in advance for any input.

   Cheers,

   Murray

   Thanks for the comment Judy. We feel these devices are important to the
   whole avalanche safety equation, and may be much more effective at
   saving lives than radio beacons. But everything has its limitations, so
   it’ll be important to keep all that information flowing…

   I’m not a winter sports enthusiast and don’t ever plan to be in an area
   where I might be caught in an avalanche, but I do appreciate your
   article. In the past two weeks I’ve heard of two different skiiers
   surviving avalanches because they were wearing some kind of airbag. I
   wanted to know more about the airbags and found your article easy to
   read and comprehend. Your example of pebbles and sand really helped me
   to understand how the airbags work and why those two skiiers survived.

   PS — I had to google to find the answer to your anti-spam quiz. That’s
   how little I know…..

   Well, in all the hysteria that usually accompanies danger combined with
   sometimes life savings devices, let’s remember that a man did not
   survive a recent avalanche even though he deployed his airbag. Very sad
   and condolences to all involved. CAIC provides details at
   http://avalanche.state.co.us/acc/acc_report.php?acc_id=442&accfm=inv

   I didn’t want to publish above link right away out of respect for
   deceased and family, now it seems a bit more appropriate in the name of
   safety education, since were seeing a disturbing trend of people piling
   on to reports of avalanche airbag saves. Actually, while we are
   confident that airbag backpacks do save lives, there is really no way
   to know if they actually did in each individual case, only through
   overall statistical studies. Why? Because with or _without_ airbag, not
   every person caught gets buried. Many end up on surface even without an
   airbag pack. And again, some _with_ the airbag still do not survive, as
   the link above very sadly shows.

   So I’m a bit confused by this blurb from the Denver Post article linked
   in your Twitter feed:

   “Using European — mostly Swiss — data of avalanche accidents involving
   air bags, which have been used across the pond for more than 25 years,
   Atkins paints a much less rosy picture of the inflatable tools.

   Based on those statistics, about three in 100 people equipped with air
   bags survive an avalanche.

   While most air-bag stats show survival rates of people who deployed
   their air bags, those numbers do not reflect the people who could not
   or forgot to pull the ripcord; forgot to fill the cartridge in the
   pack; did not install the cartridge correctly; or suffered a technical
   malfunction with the system.”

   If I recall correctly, the Swiss data they’re referring to credits
   airbags with a 97% save rate, rather than the other way around. Typical
   poor reporting, I assume? I can’t imagine user incompetence accounting
   for so many failures.

   Lou February 21, 2012 - 3:55 pm

   Jhaus,I think you’re somewhat correct, since even without airbags quite
   a few people caught in avalanches survive. In other words no way do 97%
   of people caught in avalanches die. On the other hand, a “97% save
   rate” sounds way overstated. And yeah, they don’t always work or people
   forget to pull. I witnessed an avy a while ago where the guy never
   pulled his trigger, and in the recent Telluride tragedy, the guy’s
   airbag was ripped and punctured and didn’t function. I think people
   have finally realized that beacons don’t really provide a whole lot of
   protection, so now that blind faith is being transferred over to
   airbags. Don’t get me wrong, I’m an airbag fan. Just trying for
   realism. Lou

   I wish there was more data on airbag failure rates, but I guess they’re
   either not common enough or failures just don’t get reported.
   Anecdotally there is at least one other story I’ve read of an airbag
   user having difficulty deploying the airbag, so that is definitely a
   reasonable scenario. And I for sure take that 97% number with the
   requisite brick of salt.

   “I wish there was more data on airbag failure rates, but I guess
   they’re either not common enough or failures just don’t get reported.”
   ABS seems to have deleted from its website the previously very detailed
   (and periodically updated) file on all avalanche incidents involving an
   ABS-equipped skier/rider.
   But the last time I updated my summary (probably around 2010-11, and
   then I added one or two incidents that had occurred since the last
   update), 297 people with ABS had been involved in avalanches.
   (Note that website currently cites 262 activations, but that would
   appear to leave out attempted yet unsuccessful activations.)
   Of those 297 people, 19 died.
   That represents a 93.6% survival rate, but of those 297 ABS-equipped
   people, they would not necessarily have been entrained in the avalanche
   — rather, they were just concerned enough to activate (or attempt to
   activate) the ABS system.
   So what is the comparable rate for people who were close enough to an
   avalanche that they would have activated an ABS pack had they been
   wearing one?
   Impossible to say, but the data set did include 68 other people who
   were with those ABS people.
   Now, that right there indicates a problem to me with the data set,
   since it’s excluding most partners of the ABS people (unless ABS people
   tend to travel alone).
   So I suspect we have an apples & oranges problem, as the criteria for
   inclusion of ABS people is probably being just concerned enough to
   activate,
   whereas for anyone else in the party, being caught to some extent was
   necessary to merit inclusion.
   That said, out of those 68 people, 18 died, for a 73.5% survival rate.
   Across all people who get caught to some extent in an avalanche, I
   think that 73.5% survival rate for this small subset of people (i.e.,
   no ABS, but with an ABS partner) is far lower than the survival rate
   across all caught people.
   I used to joke to my avy students that the conclusion was not to tour
   with ABS-equipped partners, but after the rather notable
   decision-making of the three most recent ABS incidents (and also the
   group handling of the most recent), I’m not so sure that’s a joke any
   longer.
   “Aha, I think the thing might be that a statistic somewhere says that
   97% of BURIED victims die.”
   For full burials, the death rate is about 60%.
   ” I think people have finally realized that beacons don’t really
   provide a whole lot of protection […]”
   The only attempt to quantify this found a 135% increase in survival
   rate for fully buried victims with beacons (over fully buried victims
   w/o beacons).
   To illustrate this in my course, I have 10 people come to the front of
   the room.
   Everybody down on the floor — you’re fully buried.
   And none of you have beacons.
   I tap two people — you can get up, you live.
   Now let’s pretend instead that all of you have beacons.
   I tap three more people — you too get to live.
   Still, 5 out of 10 buried people are still lying there dead, so not all
   that great a result, but far better than without beacons.
   (Note that the beacon searches in the study by necessity include a wide
   range of search skills — improved searching skills would increase the
   survival probability even more.)

   Fairly stunning there Jonathan- apparently all of the folks living
   their lives in the Alps, studying avalanche survival and rescue, and
   the Euro companies who invested R& D were what- just wrong? Apparently
   they need to fly to Boston in order to study under the master of
   avalanche survival and rescue knowledge? So all of the avalanches that
   you have been entrained within were just cushy, just as easy to accept
   burial and await beacon rescue? IMO, that is enough. You are destroying

   Somewhere out there I guess there’s a study that shows that cyclists
   wearing helmets are more likely to get hit by a car in city traffic
   than cyclists not wearing helmets (cars give them wider berth), and the
   conclusion is that cyclists (in city traffic anyway) statistically are
   safer not wearing helmets. To me this begs the question. What I want to
   know is if I’m hit by a car or some other set of circumstances has
   conspired to cause my head to smack hard metal or pavement, am I going
   to want to have a helmet on or not? The answer is obvious. The same
   line of reasoning applies to the use of airbags, I think. I’m not
   interested in statistics and generalizations. To me the question is if
   I happen to be caught in an avalanche, am I going to want an airbag on
   my back or not? Again, the answer is obvious. You bet!

   The use of whatever safety gear is always an interesting discussion.
   Lots of perceived benefits as opposed to actual, those both go into
   decision making process. Ski helmets continue to be a good example. Now
   lots of people are wearing helmets, so we’re getting deaths of people
   wearing helmets (we know thanks to the media’s obsessive inclusion in
   nearly every report of whether the person was wearing a helmet or not).
   And yeah, I’ve seen the stats the “prove” wearing helmets is a good
   thing… and I’m glad they get used, especially by the folks I know who
   ski fast, but I can’t help but wonder how effective they really are, as
   opposed to mythology. For example, I’ve been around skiing for a while
   and on the ski hill the overall population is definitely skiing faster,
   so perhaps helmets are saving lives, but people are skiing faster, so
   overall mortality rate stays the same, or even gets worse? Same with
   airbags — and beacons. All sorts of factors come into play when trying
   to use the stats for decision to use the stuff or not.

   Our community has pretty much made beacon use as mandatory as wearing
   your pants, e.g., you show up without your beacon you go back home and
   get it (I hope). Are helmets next on the list of such stuff? Airbags?

   Rob, although I am accustomed to internet posters appending their
   substantative arguments by resorting to ad hominem attacks (especially
   the inclusion of geographical disparagement, even though I’m within a
   daytrip drive of avalanche terrain, for which I just finished compiling
   a list of aspects for 73 distinct slide paths for my avalanche course
   students), yours is the first ad hominen attack I have ever read that
   didn’t even bother specifying the substanative point(s) of
   disagreement.
   To clarify, the section of my comment on ABS mainly just reiterated
   ABS’s own data.
   I then also explained the difficulties of trying to compare the 93.6%
   ABS survival rate with other survival rates.
   I’m sorry that I simply assumed that from all of the data I presented
   that the central conclusion was so obvious that it didn’t need to be
   stated explicitly.
   So here it is: yes, all else being equal, a person with an ABS (or
   competitor’s) pack entrained in an avalanche has a higher survival rate
   than a person without.
   Regarding the all-else-being-equal caveat, I had only one sentence on
   risk homeostasis, and I’ll leave it at that.
   But I’ll also add here whether across all ski tours and relevant
   backcountry risks the ABS weight would be better devoted to other
   emergency gear like AED, sat phone, extra insulation, shelter, etc.
   (No, I’m not providing the answer, whether in the form of data analysis
   or otherwise, but just bringing up the issue.)
   I suppose though that the above qualifies as the kind of “short 500
   word uber-analytical reply…” that you disparage, as opposed to your own
   ad hominem attacks (with mistaken geographical basis)?

   It is not arguable to carry a beacon and shovel, and probe, in the
   modern vernacular. However these are all failure devices, and one’s
   body is not spared the forces of the avalanche by wearing a beacon. An
   avalanche airbag provides real protection from the forces avalanche
   entrainment, especially resistance to burial, and a significantly high
   survival rate.

   Serious entities in Europe have invested significant R&D into
   developing and then demonstrating efficacy of an avalanche airbag. We
   read here and elsewhere that avalanche airbags are used extensively and
   increasingly. Also, protection/ survival is constantly demonstrated in
   actual incidents, as well as some failures to protect the user in a few
   cases.

   I have skitoured with one man saved by a transceiver rescue, and with
   another who saved his friend with a transceiver. However, I believe it
   to be foolish in the utmost to assume any increased chance of surviving
   an avalanche based on the proven low success rate of transceiver rescue
   in avalanche burial. Positive data is shown time after time for the
   efficacy of avalanche airbags. Spinning numbers will not negate the
   advantages of the only real avalanche safety device.

   Lou, Wildsnow attracted me because of the extensive information about
   Dynafit equipment, and because of a blogger whose lifestyle is in the
   mountains, and who also recognizes the reality of avalanche hazard and
   even other dangers involved in backcountry skiing.

   So, please give us more about Dynafit, not just the intricacies of the
   hardware, but how does it tour and ski.

   There are many bloggers here who live the mountain lifestyle, yet serve
   up information with humility. Credibility in regard to mountain topics
   would best be given to folks who live, work, and ski in the mountains,
   evaluate gear in the mountains, and yes specifically western mountains.

   Many who read Wildsnow are high level and even professional folks who
   live and work in the mountains. No need for constant lecture from folks
   who (edit and redaction, added “in my opinion”) have information from
   visits and a lot of conjecture based on reading. Jeez, that would be as
   silly as perhaps a backcountry skiing magazine that has headquarters on
   the east coast…

   Rob, very impressive that you continue your ad hominem attacks on me,
   and indeed in greater detail this time too (even if you didn’t bother
   to mention my name specifically in this latest round).
   I’m not going to bother looking up the bios now for the authors of the
   beacon study, but all four have very Germanic-sounding names, so maybe
   you’d like that, and they did find that beacon use among backcountry
   travelers increased the survival rate by 135%.
   As for how much ABS packs increase survival rates (over and above
   beacons), that is difficult to determine. The President of the American
   Avalanche Association believes that the increase is only 3% (even
   though he’s an advocate of their use). I suspect the increase is bigger
   than that, but fortunately for you my upcoming detailed analysis of the
   available data (“lecture?” “spinning?”) will be published elsewhere (so
   as to avoid “destroying the credibility” of this blog).

   Just a note on comment style. I think it’s fair for Rob to allude to
   the background and credibility of our writers and while, sure, his
   somewhat sarcastic style (which I personally do not find attractive)
   with above comment can be interpreted as an “attack,” he does bring up
   a good point and that’s that one needs to feel comfortable with the
   author of something they’re taking and using.

   think Rob is wrong to assume Jonathan doesn’t live near serious
   mountains, and to assume Jonathan is not involved enough in the sport
   to do his work with beacons. On the other hand, I totally agree with
   Rob that we need to be very careful about who we give the bully pulpit
   to, since Wildsnow has a vast bank of credibility and I would not want
   to errode that. Thus, I’ll continue to be careful.

   As for Jonathan in particular, I stand behind his work with beacons and
   his attempts to present confusing safety data in various ways.

   I might redact a bit of Rob’s comment… I’ll go back and read it. But
   I’d ask all our guest bloggers to keep their skin thick. After all,
   getting some comments is desirable, as that’s what happens when people
   actually read your stuff, which on the whole is actually quite unusual
   for most blogs out there.

   Above are logical discussion in regard to beacons and airbags in my
   view and experience. Yep to above, I have been on a plane, in the past
   a fairly broad exposure to avalanche science internationally
   didactically and on the ground, and in my recent years more locally and
   personally since I am raising a family.

   The latest example is the unfortunate and heartbreaking Stevens Pass
   incident, which included locals with whom I was acquainted. The
   survivor used an ABS. The victims were swept 2650 vertical feet and
   deeply buried. Tragically the best beacon and shovel with expert
   operators did not save them. We grieve for this situation and all
   affected, and miss those lost.

   ary_Tunnel_Creek_Avalanche_Accident_2-29-2012.pdf

   Sadly, yet another example of the futility or near useless fascination
   with beacon and shovel rescue. As I said above, it is not arguable to
   carry a beacon and shovel, and probe, in the modern vernacular. However
   these are all failure devices, and one’s body is not spared the forces
   of the avalanche by wearing a beacon. An avalanche airbag provides real
   protection from the forces avalanche entrainment, especially resistance
   to burial, and a significantly high survival rate.

   As for other opinion, there are various folks who post online.
   Background is indeed a valid question.

   There are folks who have a lot of experience and valid expertise
   posting and reading here. The transformation of the mainstream
   avalanche world and the presentation of merit badges and titles in the
   past decade is quite interesting in my view- my experience goes back a
   few decades. I learned transceiver rescue with Skadi with earpieces to
   unroll- we accomplished 3 minute recoveries in practice on avalanche
   paths, I recall development of ABS and bought one as soon as it was
   available. I trained the first avy dog in my area and started the
   program. I and many of my friends with similar views have survived
   being caught and buried or had rides- and we regret the failure of
   judgement. Many of us as well have been on avalanche rescues and
   recoveries, not just read about it. It is indeed not possible to
   appreciate avalanche entrainment by reading about it. I know many who
   have done avalanche work and travel in avalanche terrain for decades
   with more expertise and experience than the (redacted) lists and
   Titles, (redacted). I offer my opinion since I believe there exists a
   deficit of sober thinking about avalanche topics, and I offer my
   experience to back up my words without listing titles and etc.

   It really does not matter how much practice and evaluation of
   transceivers one does on the grass in a metro park. Rehashing available
   data ad nauseum really does not alter the physics of avalanche forces.
   Avoid this market-driven fascination with transceivers, shovels,
   probes, avalanche airbag packs. Manufacturers just want to sell more
   gear, and some of those getting Pro Deals in my view are selling out
   and promote the beacon/ shovel / probe fascination to some degree.

   All that matters is to avoid being caught in an avalanche. Avalanche
   potential is not at all mysterious- it is well studied and in practice
   forecasted with higher probability of accuracy than most things in
   life. It is only mysterious or unexpected to the ignorant and those who
   lack self-control even when they possess the knowledge. Most terrain is
   safe at times, a lot is safe most of the time. With proper study,
   consideration and discipline one can avoid being caught. In the end,
   when deciding to enter avalanche terrain, get it right or die- even if
   you have the latest gadgets. To quote Andre Roch “The avalanche does
   not know that you are an expert,”

   Rob; “avalanche potential is not at all mysterious”
   I respectfully disagree. I am experienced, and, I have sometimes
   thought that I could predict when there was avalanche potential,
   however; the more I see the less certain I can be in my predictions (
   my shovel has been used, and, I have been caught in a couple).
   For example: About 10 days ago; I had climbed up a ridge, and, crossed
   steep side slopes on a very similar aspect to the slope that we skied
   (the side slopes were short). There were no signs of any natural
   releases. The snow looked very solid, and. there had been much less
   slide activity than normal.
   We were being cautious as it was getting later in the day, taking a
   route that was on the edge of a bowl through trees of varying sizes.
   About halfway down as I was gliding to a stop on a small ridge, the
   slope started sliding just above me on a 30 cm slab, I was able to gain
   enough grip (things like this have happened before), and, I was able to
   ski out of the slide which ran about 100 meters.
   On other occasions; I have seen slopes that I could not believe could
   slide that have been triggered by glazed snow patches from the previous
   winter.
   I have seen professionals make stability predictions based on digging a
   single pit.
   I don’t know all the answers, or maybe not even a few of them.

   Great, Barr, good discussion. Even your words show analysis and some
   understanding of what caused the avalanches that you mention.It sounds
   like you have an idea of how to approach the same in the future.

   In my case, I recall a high rate of knowing the avalanche potential,
   yet twice I have paid the price of near-death when pushing it too
   close. Even in my accidents, I had full knowledge of the potential and
   the snowpack, but inadvisably pushed it too far. We all may fight that
   tendency or temptation, the higher the level of expertise the higher
   the death rate in avalanches.That is the challenge, to beat that
   statistic!

   I was asked this week to write elsewhere again on these topics and
   thought of what my personal bottom line would be. I decided that I
   believe that if I enter avalanche terrain at all, I would do so only if
   I would without a partner, without a transceiver, without a shovel,
   without an ABS. I own and use all of this. But my point is, my bottom
   line is that the decision is the same. If I would not ski particluar
   avalanche terrain solo in the backcountry, then I should not do so even
   with a strong group, and while wearing an ABS. I believe that if a
   person cannot learn and then analyze the avalanche potential to that
   degree, then that person should not enter avalanche terrain. Otherwise,
   continual and increasing numbers of easily preventable deaths in
   avalanches will occur with recreationists.

   Those who venture onto avalanche terrain need to consider the avalanche
   problem soberly, and make the proper choice. Gadgets and puffed-up
   discussion do not alter the terrible physics of avalanche entrainment.
   For me, that choice is do I know the slope to be safe enough to enter
   solo without a transceiver or ABS, and enter it only if the answer is

   Rob and Barr, the best comments relate your own experience, thanks for
   going that direction with the discussion.

   Rob, our bloggers and commenters go to the effort of being here and
   sharing. None of us can do that perfectly. I’m not sure I understand
   what you mean by “puffed-up discussion” but it sounds like an insult to
   those of us writing here and I’d again ask you to please go easy with
   that sort of thing.

   Rob, discussion is valuable. It’s never going to be perfect. Please get
   used to it and stop the insulting language. Sure, we can be critical of
   each other, but we must do so constructively and politely or this whole
   thing we devolve to near or utter uselessness.

   It does not matter except for the decision to enter avalanche terrain.
   Get it right or die, and if you get it wrong someone may then inherit
   all of the fancy avalanche gadgets that were sucessfully marketed!

   My comments are not at all pointed specifically at Wildsnow. I had an
   issue with one line of Wildsnow comment that I felt overstepped the
   background of the commenter unreasonably. I have attended conferences
   and etc. and heard plenty of puffed up language and nonsense that
   attempts to deny or obfuscate reality. There is plenty of new circular
   hot air, as well as occasional incremental improvement in discussion
   and theory of avalanche topics.An interesting mix in the avalanche
   world- scientists, real fulltime practitioners, and then also attached
   various flotsam from part time ski area jobs, and folks with titles and
   merit badges, and ‘instructors’ of all backgrounds (or none).

   Weak thought and equivocation, agreeing with a popular line not
   strongly supported, surrendering to ‘mystery’, all are tendencies in
   this discussion that deny the hard reality.

   And Lou, ‘puffed up’ likely applies to me as well sometimes. But to
   temper an idea, perhaps it needs to be put out there and subject to
   discussion and criticism. That is how we learn or prove a concept.

   I ski backcountry powder on avalanche terrain more than most, often
   solo, for three decades now. Perhaps one may imagine the tough
   self-dialogue and decision-making involved with staying safe and
   staying alive. If I make the final mistake, then some can have a grand
   discussion about the partners that I should have had with the best
   transceivers and biggest shovels!

   Late entry into this, may I say, intense but valuable discussion. I
   won’t comment on the validity of anyone’s comments since I am a newbie
   – as a matter of fact, need to reread my “Staying Alive in Avalanche
   Territory” book for a class this weekend.

   Reading over many or Rob’s comments I can see how they might seem
   insulting – I am not defending his tone. But, I also see his phrasing
   sometimes seem a bit off – with some apparent non-sequitor and unusual
   choice of words. Sorry Rob, I don’t mean to offend. Perhaps, some of
   this interpretation of a combative/insulting tone may be a bit a result
   of that choice of phrasing?

   Anyways, Rob’s statement, paraphrasing here, that if he would not enter
   a specific area and conditions of avalanche terrain solo without any of
   the normal gear, he would also not do it with a group seems to be an
   interesting and very valuable view. Perhaps it is an already prevalent
   concept, but to a mere newbie like me, I find it quite provocative.
   Just having the right gear and a group of people along is not
   sufficient to ameliorate the inherent danger, even when it is slight. I
   might try to think of it the same way in my new found adventures.
   (Granted, even while skiing inbounds here in WA and last week in Alta,
   it was quite important to have a partner with me when skiing advanced
   and isolated terrain -it’s just smart).

   Nick, thanks for your take. Yes, one has to take comments with some
   grace since most people are not Ernest Hemingway. On the other hand,
   there is an art to just how you set the tone of a blog comment, and for
   most people the art really isn’t all that tough. If you want people to
   read what you have to say, you have to be nice and caring, appearing
   too harsh just results in writing for yourself.

   As far as “puffed up” goes, one thing anyone should realize about blog
   comments or even the blog posts themselves is we are all trying to make
   a point or say something quickly. The result is sometimes the wrong
   impression. I know I’m guilty of that pretty often, stuff like
   appearing too strident, too know-itall… Again, being aware of these
   factors is key. “Slow to anger…” and all that.

   We do try to keep things a bit more civil than some places, but doing
   so is an imperfect art. More, it’s not like I never sleep and sit here
   and watch the comments roll in 24/7. I tried that once, but didn’t make
   it past 22 hours, and that’s about the time Rob’s comments started
   rolling in (grin).

   Great Nick, no offense, open for discussion and debate. This is a
   serious topic, I have observed the avalanche world professionally and
   then in my personal activities since the late 70s- not as long as Lou
   and others. Perhaps I am a bit rough in these topics to some, not the
   intent. Not intending to cause grief, just a gift I suppose. I am
   puffed up as well sometimes but try to backup what I say by relating
   genuine experience.We need to challenge each other and ourselves in our
   thinking in regard to these life and death decisions, in my view.

   Nick I am thrilled that you grasp what I put forth. That is, I believe
   my standard should be to enter avalanche terrain while having partners,
   transceiver, and ABS ONLY if I would enter the same terrain without the
   equipment or partner. This is the best summary of my views. Sadly, many
   tragic events prove what I say, in my view.

   There seems too often the wrong focus. Hours of class time devoted to
   transceiver and probe/ shovel theory. Education must first emphasize
   avoiding being in an avalanche. Before digging pits and learning a new
   language to describe details probably not really understood, one needs
   to know the basic threshold of terrain, snowpack and weather factors to
   allow avalanching. If that threshold is met, then the slope may
   avalanche- and it is incumbent on anyone entering avalanche terrain to
   prove to themselves why it will NOT avalanche and cause harm. It is a
   body of knowledge and science that is definite and certain- the
   certainty however gets lost in so much unimportant bla bla.

   Do not enter a slope with avalanche rescue gear, ABS, and partners
   unless one would do so alone, without the avalanche gear. We see too
   often the consequences of pushing the limit- even with the transceiver,
   shovel, probe, and partners..

   Good discussion, but my motivation to post was prompted by the loss of
   more folks who were experienced BC skiers. Often it seems that when the
   news of an avalanche victim is published; someone will second guess
   their judgement (not at Wildsnow).
   I am humbled enough by my experiences, that I do not wish to judge, but

   is why I keep coming back to wildsnow. Obvious that Rob’s writing
   skills could be better but so could mine. He needs to be careful about
   looking “mean” even though he obviously is just trying to make a strong
   point. As for his take on avalanche classes, I took one recently and
   thought it was pretty good and the teahers told us many times we’d
   better not get caught in the first place. I already knew that, but they
   did make the point.

   Bar, we do “second guess” judgement here on occasion. I see nothing
   wrong with that if it’s done constructively and with sensitivity. But
   it’s optional. I’ve been taken to task for doing it, and for not doing.
   It’s one of those things where you’re danged if you do and danged if
   you don’t… With Steve Romeo, he made it so obvious what he was up to, I
   see little reason to do analysis of what happened. More, if you read
   the reports what happened is so obvious as to make any analysis seem
   like, yes, puffery. Also, I knew Steve well enough where I’m perhaps
   too close to the situation to be an objective commenter. Sometimes, one
   just has to shut up. Even me (grin). Though I do have a eulogy type of
   take coming… it’s not a “second guess” type of thing…

   Also, I’m of the opinion that if possible it is frequently better to
   “second guess” near misses. Just because of sensitivity issues.

   Perhaps we can get back to the topic of this thread – airbags.

   Rob’s comments are irrelevant when it comes to beacons/shovels/probes –
   it is obvious that [critical] recovery tools don’t keep you from
   getting into avalanches.
   However, what I take to be his main point IS relevant when it comes to
   airbags.

   Will people’s decision-making be influenced by using an airbag pack
   that may keep them a bit safer if they are caught in an avalanche?

   It is a good question. I think that is a significant risk.
   That’s why it is very important to learn more about how much safer
   airbags actually keep you and in what situations.

   Many of the early (quite preliminary at this point) studies are
   positive.
   However, posters above have noted questions about the euro-bias to the
   studies not taking tree-involvement into consideration. Trees are one
   of the reasons that trauma/survival stats are very different in North
   America vs. the Alps (e.g., a new study: Haegeli et al, CMAJ, 2012).
   Some preliminary studies also suggest that airbags don’t provide any
   additional protection if you are caught in a terrain trap or low on a
   slab (rather than at the crown) as there is not enough time for sorting
   [they don’t make the situation worse though].

   From my perspective, the bottom line is that airbags are clearly a
   valuable tool – but not one that works perfectly in all situations.
   Therefore, it is still true that tools should not influence your
   decision making (and that experience and training remain the most
   important aspects of safety).

   Obvious I guess, but the airbags are the first tool that really pushes
   that question a little. I’d love to learn about new studies/info on
   airbag situational performance…
   Reply

   Lou March 12, 2012 - 2:45 pm

   Yeah, I’d agree there is some yawner above… but yes, the question of
   how well airbags actually work is in my opinion very open. Recent media
   hype was unfortunate, both here and in Europe. But the fact remains
   that we keep getting survivors with airbags alongside mortality
   without. At some point, the human mind has to start drawing obvious
   conclusions. What I think we need to watch for, to be intellectually
   honest, is for the time a _lot_ of people are using airbags, and how
   many of them live or die. Till then, hmmmm.

   This reminds me of the great helmet debate. When fewer people used to
   use helmets, it was easy to argue that they could save life. Now that
   we get fairly consistent reports of skiers dying while wearing helmets,
   it should be obvious to any thinking person that the issue is not that
   simple.

   If anyone needs any sobering up about airbags, you can look at photos
   of the tattered one from the unfortunate avalanche death near Telluride
   just weeks ago. The blatant fact that the person was skiing with both
   an airbag and an Avalung, but solo when there was danger, is definitely
   food for thought when we discuss the “risk acceptance” effect of this
   gear. No judgment can be made specific to that event, but nothing wrong
   with extrapolation and discussing. No link at my fingertips at the
   moment.

   Addendum: I do believe that airbags work, I only question to what
   degree…

   Rob Mullins March 12, 2012 - 6:01 pm

   It is relevant, Phil, that there is scant improvement in survival
   statistics associated with good use of beacon, shovel, and probe. This
   is of primary importance because of the near beacon/ shovel/ probe
   worship by some. This supports the use of airbag packs, which I have
   owned and used for 8 years. I first saw a demonstration in 1994, now
   online are many videos of airbags saving lives. This is important
   because some folks think it reasonable to challenge large avalanche
   paths on Considerable to High hazard days when there are significant
   amounts of new snow or loose snow to come into play. I think that folks
   with the wrong idea or poor education are getting killed. I think that
   it is obvious from many reports that many of the deaths were in
   avalanches basically forecast the previous day.

   My lengthy discussion here resulted from my disagreement with someone
   (redacted)…

   Again, from above, I expect to see an article in a publication that I
   subscribe per the statistician comments. All very interesting.

   I hope to help people avoid getting caught in avalanches. I am an avid
   skitourer, and had a significant career in the avalanche world a while
   back now. I recall three times or more individuals get caught in
   avalanches when I advised against that particular slope, once in front
   of me. As well, I am aware of others I have helped, won’t belabor it,
   will try to help others. This is a significant and serious topic. I
   simply hope to contribute for the good. So apparently my comments per
   some are mean or boring, whatever. I will try to not offend, but I have
   a background with expertise from previous significant responsibility in
   these topics so I come across rather stridently.

   Interesting discussion. Especially Matt’s points on ABS statistics. I
   think all tools available to improve your chances of survival should be
   embraced. Having this said, I have not yet found any publicly available
   research on the effectiveness of ABS. The reports linked in this thread
   raise a lot of questions and prove little. Hopefully people don’t get
   tempted skiing stuff they otherwise wouldn’t.

   Briefly on residual risk, a principal concept in european avalanche
   eduction. The idea of being able to always predict avalanches by using
   science, digging snow pits etc. has been abonded in the last century.
   Of course these methods are all used but it is acknowledged that there
   will always remain a residual risk. As a result of this there has been
   a paradigm shift to risk reduction/risk management strategies, where
   avalanche incident statistics are used to improve the odds. Typically
   these take into account things like slope aspect, inclination which are
   then combined with local observations, avalanche reports etc. to make
   decisions.

   Several risk reduction frameworks have been developped (e.g. Werner
   Munter 3×3, Nivotest, Stop Go).
   Basically they all give you a rule based framework to decide whether to
   ski a slope or not, this way limiting the possibly dangerous
   consequences of human heuristics. Heuristics involve experience-based
   problem solving helping humans to make decisions when presented with a
   lot of information. In making avalanche decisions heuristics can be
   misleading. For example familiarity with the terrain and local
   knowledge (contradictious as it may sound) are well know heuristic
   traps. In France there’s a trend where avalanche victims are
   increasingly the old foxes (not sure if that’s an english expression 🙂
   ), the very experienced older men who have been skiing their local
   mountains for decades.

   Of course I fully subscribe Rob in that preventing getting into an
   avalanche is your primary concern. However, if you are unfortunate
   (note i’m not using the word foolish or uneducated, because also the
   most experienced and skilled person is subject to residual risk) to get
   in a slide then i for sure would be happy to have a beacon and ABS to
   give me a better chance of making it out alive.

   I gave a speech one time entitled “The A-R-T of Risk Management”,
   wherein “A” stood for AVOID, “R” stood for REDUCE and “T” stood for
   TRANSFER. This discussion keeps jumbling these groupings. AVOID comes
   first as its cheapest, simplest, most effective and most efficient.
   REDUCE comes second as one can exercise complete control and TRANSFER
   last as risk event amelioration lies in the
   hands/minds/skills/gear/resources/timing of others. The twin pillars,
   (pillar from PILR as in one pillar’s P=Pre and the second pillar’s
   P=Post, so P plus I=Injury, L=Loss & R=Reduction) may help define the
   differences. AVOID is pre-injury, REDUCE could be both pre-injury and
   post-injury, while TRANSFER is effected post-injury. AVOID requires
   applied, relevant knowledge (avy courses, time in field, etc.) so you
   do not venture onto the killer slope. REDUCE is an avy ballon bag,
   armour, swimming, etc. so when your mind (or luck) fails you, the loss
   will be minimized. TRANSFER needs a beacon to call to another beacon,
   summoning it, a probe and shovel to be applied by people not the
   victim/caller. That help? P.S. You ALL care, that is why you ALL wrote.
   I would go into the mountains with ANY of you, because I want to go
   with, and only with, those who care. TRANSFER works in the avalanche
   scenario only with those who care. TAKE CARE.

   Am a Californian who grew up snowboarding in Tahoe (resorts and
   backcountry), with trips out to Colorado, and Canada.

   I…as my friends will tell you, am an idiot. Over the past two decades I
   have put myself into too many situations that when I look back on now,
   realize I am quite lucky to be alive, and walking. Sure, there are
   crazier people, but there is a larger % that listen to mom.

   Worst injury came from a cornice slide taking me off a cliff 35-40ft
   cliff, landing flat and getting severe whiplash, and damaged vertebrae
   (No insurance, skipped the hospital). Have been in other slides: small
   slab, sluff (of course…who hasn’t if on steep terrain), and slush.
   Slides occurred in California in desolation wilderness,
   Whistler-Blackcomb, (Canada), and St. Anton am Arlberg, (Austria) a
   couple times, Ishgl, (Austria), among others.

   Was it the weather? Was it me pursuing pow and fresh tracks in areas I
   shouldn’t have been. Did I ignore the inner voice: you shouldn’t be
   here? (Sadly, yes) Was it me ignoring the signs? Yes, all of the above.
   Again… Idiot.

   All could have been avoided (had I like the comment above, listened to
   my mom and stayed in the car).

   But, you only live once. The motto I live by. And I want to look back
   and appreciate every moment, every storm, and every steep, hard, rocky
   line. Now having kids and getting older I want to enjoy those moments
   without breaking bones and dying, and risking the lives of others
   around me. I AM a risk taker. I LOVE adrenaline. I CANNOT change that.
   I think many of the people reading this thread probably have the same
   Type-A personality, or are those just wanting to be safe (good on ya
   for that). Yes, these packs COULD result in you being carried further.
   But they can ALSO enable you to swim on top and get out of the
   avalanche with more control than not having one on…in some cases. (I
   will not be a tool and give some %; will stick to some cases…works for
   me.)

   That is why I am investing into one of these packs, and an Avalung.

   I now live in Switzerland. I can say that while I haven’t used the
   packs, have learned a bit about them. A good friend owns an outdoor
   products store, and he and our friends are all certified Bergführers
   (mountain guides) who lead trips ice climbing, rock climbing, back
   country skiing (skitouren) and back country snowshoeing. These guys are
   scaling the Eiger Northface on a Saturday, and going ice climbing on
   sunday, skitours when the weather is prime. Always on the mountains.
   Using the best gear. Fit, knowledgeable, and each, preaches the benefit
   of these packs when back country. They say that ABS, and Mammut are the
   way to go… and in response to the original post, they are not
   complaining (too much) about a few extra grams. Live or die? Buy, or
   not? Easy decision, for me anyways.

   The backpacks that explode above your head can impair your vision to
   the rear, though they do have a great technology, that being keeping
   your head up; where as, ABS packs, opening as wings, are great for
   carrying a board and skis, and maintaining your ability to look behind
   you, as well as room for your arms to move while swimming or clawing
   through the snow to the sides. Looking to the rear may not be important
   to some while in a slide, but have heard first hand they enjoyed being
   able to look to the rear when one was barreling down onto them and when
   quickly deciding which way to head.

   Options and videos:
   Snowpulse: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veW3XNt0SZY
   Float: http://www.dump.com/snowboarderairbag/
   Mammut’s R.A.S (Removable Airbag System)
   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HmrMR9ODeA

   RAS is popular here in Switzerland because users can remove the Airbag
   system when not needed, (good for summer hikes, day trips, etc).

   ABS: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25t-j7MGI2M

   ABS is ABS. Proven. Pick your poison. Your life, your decision.

   Having spoke with a couple guys here that have been caught, one using
   ABS and the other a Snowpulse, must say that both spoke highly of each
   brand and both liked their packs.

   Though I must conclude my post with this statement: First comment from
   non-ABS. “Woulda been good to see behind me. I think I am going to look
   into an ABS pack” (Translated from German).

   Boy scout motto: Anyone? … … …

   Follow-up to above comment. After much research, reading and visiting
   shops to try on and compare, and speaking with my friends (guides/
   outdoors products store owners) I opted for the Mammut Ride 30L with
   the snowpulse system. While I am still questioning my decision, I think
   I made a good decision. Can always buy an ABS later once more options
   are available like the new northface pack.

   There was a promotion across the border in Austria, selling the ABS at
   a great price, compared to what I have seen in the US (~$1100). If I
   wanted to think about resale value later in the US. would have got the
   ABS, but for me, the mammut construction, weight and system seemed
   great for what I will use it for.

   With ABS, I loved the ABS double airbags, as well as the Vario 0
   usability. Thought it was great I could pack the base unit with my
   shovel, probe, and H2O and use it without a packsack installed. Easy to
   travel with ABS. Trusted. Proven. Great.

   Didn’t like the material used on the packs, compared to that of the
   mammut. Thinking longevity, wanted a pack that can withstand snowshoes
   and snowboards and ice axes and other gear attached. Also didn’t like
   that there was no easy way to attach ropes to the pack (25L option).
   Knowing I will be doing backcountry hikes/climbs/repelling, was
   important to be able to have an easy way to attach ropes to the pack,
   over the top, nearer to my body, as opposed to on the front. Liked how
   stable the ABS pack was when I mounted a snowboard to it, as well as
   snowshoes to it. Didn’t like there were no cinching straps, to flatten
   the pack down. Didn’t like how the upper straps, to cinch the upper
   pack closer to the shoulders, had to go over the zipper of the lower
   compartment. Not a huge deal, but, worth mentioning.

   Snowpulse Guide 30 seemed great. Considered it. Liked the shoulder
   strap, rear neck storage area of the airbag, leaving more of the pack
   to be used, as well as keeping the pack lower profile and the weight
   above your shoulders, instead of the upper back. Materials were great;
   good padding on shoulder straps and back. Functional for backcountry
   tours. Liked that it had a waist belt pocket, and a waist
   carabiner-hook to hang carabiners and quick draws. Pretty cool!

   Was in the store as a customer came in with his pack to test the
   system. He had the Mammut pack and was satisfied with it.

   Thanks for this article. Will share it with friends. Thanks for the
   useful discussion!! Seriously!!

   I noticed in this write up that all of the airbags have a venturi
   valve. I have the Mammut Snowpulse pack and recently refilled my
   cartridge here at the local shop where they exhausted the air supply at
   nearly full. I was just curious how important it is to top off the
   cartridge with the venturi. Has anyone done any tests to verify
   inflation with a less than full cartridge?
   Reply

   Nick February 25, 2013 - 10:50 am

   I’ve fired off several airbags over the years with a less than full
   cylinder. At room temp, it’s not a problem and completely fills. The
   problem is in colder temps, the air in the cylinder contracts and may
   not be enough.
   Reply

   Charlie February 25, 2013 - 11:43 am

   I’d imagine that the manufacturer expects the venturi to supplement an
   already full cartridge. A venturi will let them use a smaller
   cartridge, so they’re going to exploit it almost as much as they can.
   Unless the manufacturer specs a minimum fill, I’d top it off.

   As for temperature, the relevant units are Kelvin. Room temperature is
   ~300 K. -40 degrees C/F is 233 K. At fixed pressure, the volume of a
   gas is proportional to absolute temperature. So, by volume, the
   cartridge will generate 22% less “air” at the coldest temperatures
   almost anyone might be interested in skiing. I’d be more worried about
   the bag material cracking at -40 degrees, or the valve assembly failing
   in some way, than any inflation issue.

   I think the article and WS mission is definitely a good thing. I have
   gone from cynical ranting about these things from stepping back and
   taking it in. One thing that I think needs to be understood is none of
   this is all or nothing. The discussion of to use or not to use has
   degrees. If I am climbing and skiing powder around Colorado, I take avy
   gear. If I am out climbing a high altitude peak in Asia or South
   America, I don’t even carry a avy beacon. Things like weight and
   logistics mandate different levels of what is necessary even possible.
   Conditions also warrant different approach. If it’s a hard freeze May
   corn day, I don’t think some gear is applicable. Point being, the
   evolution of these types of gear is the cultures ability to manufacture
   a better scenario. Mistakes get made, acts of God occur and the take
   away from the article is that there is an awareness and motivation to
   accommodate this stuff which results in opinions and ideas coming
   together to eliminate some of the terrible tragedy that can and does
   occur in the activity. I don’t care what the percentages are, its a
   fact that air bags have saved lives. While I may choose not to buy one
   for whatever reason, they are part of the evolution and a life saved
   even if I don’t know the person is a benefit to me personally in that I
   get really bummed when I hear of people getting killed. Nice article.

   Here is a study in German (03/2014) with a dataset of 1504 cases. The
   outcome in short:

   – More people die while wearing an airbags than expected.
   – Risk of death without airbag is 22%, with airbag inflated is 11%
   (preventing 50% of deaths).
   – In 20% of all cases airbags were not inflated (among people who were
   wearing an airbag).
   – when not inflated airbags are taken into account, risk of death is
   reduced to 13% (Instead of 11%, preventing 41% of deaths)
   – 60% of all cases where airbags where not inflated are due to not
   taking any action to inflate the airbag.
   – Gain of safety is reduced to zero when people use the security of
   airbags to go into areas where big avalanches are possible

   I have not read every comment so I apologize if this has been
   discussed. Air bags, as written above, work off of the theory that
   bigger objects rise to the top. I am curious which airbags have the
   most volume? The BCA look like they are on the skimpy side, but that is
   only based on looking at pictures. Anyone have info on this? Bigger
   seems better if the pack weight is similar.

   Lou Dawson 2 December 12, 2014 - 3:51 pm

   Bigger isn’t better, it just has to be big enough to have the “brazil
   nut effect” and after that you’re just hauling around extra weight.
   They’ve been testing the things for years, and all the bags for sale
   are CE certified to have a minimum volume that works, along with fast
   inflation and such. Lou

   The scientific version of the paper Bas linked to was originally
   published in Resuscitation journal (
   http://www.resuscitationjournal.com/article/S0300-9572%2814%2900566-8/a
   bstract?cc=y )

   A previous report by Haegeli on Canadian statistics published here:
   http://www.avalancheresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/2012_Haegeli
   _CndAvBalloonPart1.pdf

   And some international statistics presented at ISSW 2012
   http://arc.lib.montana.edu/snow-science/item.php?id=1601

   Numbers change with different sample sizes and other variables but
   ultimately I wouldn’t start off your summary with 97% effectiveness as
   marketed by ABS. The 11% vs. 22% (or 50% reduction) is much more
   relevant as mentioned by Tremper in that other link you got above..

   50% of the otherwise dead sounds like a decent bargain, for situations
   where the tool may be useful.
   Reply

   Lou Dawson 2 December 14, 2014 - 9:53 am

   Tremper says/implies that if you use good judgement and stick to slopes
   where the airbag would actually help, it can add a large amount of
   safety.

   Oddly enough, using an airbag correctly seems to ask us to be _more_
   cautious so carrying the weight is worth it — otherwise we’re just
   carrying around a psychological crutch for bad judgement.

   Apparently, every season a number of people actually don’t deploy the
   airbag when they get caught in the slide, or else hit trees and rocks
   or go over cliffs, or are in such a large slide the airbag is of no
   help due to trauma. Adding to the confusion, I’m reading the theory
   that in a larger slide the airbag can make you fall down the mountain
   faster (in a large slide, you’re essentially taking a huge brutal fall
   down a mountain).

   Most certainly, a lot of airbag shoppers are making purchases based on
   the feeling they’re getting a large overall increase in personal
   safety, when that actually might not be the case.

   I think stats to date to include, in a raw sense, risk homeostasis,
   insofar as they include incidents where atrocious judgment was
   displayed? Sheep Creek certainly was a good example where users weren’t
   prepared to deploy, and where the nature of the slide meant that the
   “Brazil Nut” effect may or may not have had either time to work, or
   have made a difference by the time it did (though burial depths
   varied). As for Lou’s last sentence, which I read to say a lot of
   shoppers are ignoring the risk homeostasis issue, it does seem that
   making the purchase would be a good time to sit down and also
   explicitly determine what tools the shopper will use to try to minimize
   risk before the fact, and to partner the purchase with better terrain
   management.

   Lou Dawson 2 December 14, 2014 - 11:26 am

   I forgot to mention that risk homeostasis is said to also be mitigating
   overall increase in avalanche safety that airbags provide. How much
   influence that has, very hard to tell.

   As for Sheep Creek, from what I’ve seen there I doubt deployed airbags
   would have had much if any benefit, but of course I’m only making an
   educated guess. Avalungs could have helped, but with no dig-out for
   what was it, hours? the Avalung would have had limited effectiveness as
   well. And that’s assuming the victims would have had time to grab their
   lung and get it in their mouth, and assuming it wasn’t ripped out from
   the force of that big chunk of snow that fell on them. Overall, a good
   example of how all the safety gear in the world doesn’t help in certain
   situations — sometimes situations that could perhaps be easily
   mitigated by some basic changes in procedure that have nothing to do
   with gear (smaller groups, spread farther apart, etc.).

   Lou,,
   Two of the Sheep Creek victims had airbag packs, the rest had Avalungs.
   But, none of them had them “rigged and ready” for use. Of course all of
   them had on transceivers and that’s how they were found.

   Lou Dawson 2 December 14, 2014 - 12:30 pm

   Thanks Halsted. In your opinion as one who dug up the victims, what do
   you think would have possibly happened if all devices were deployed? It
   appeared to me that airbags would have done nothing, and the time to
   rescue was so long that Avalung survival was unlikely as well. Yet
   amazing things can indeed happen, especially in shallow burials.

   BTW, this is a good example of the type of accident where “victims had
   airbags, not deployed” that is included in good sets of statistics.’

   Lou,
   The guys with the avalanche airbags might have stayed on the surface.
   Hard to say. Yes, there were a couple of guys that were buried fairly
   “shallowly” that the Avalung might have helped. But, with it being a 4+
   hour burial its hard to say how helpful they would have been. There was
   no hope for the one deeply (3+ meters) buried victim.

   So equivocal on a theoretical ability to mitigate for that one. Safe
   travel protocol would have saved several lives, and with an ALP TRUTH
   score of 5.5 that simple tool would have suggested a different
   itinerary. That’s probably a different blog topic overall though, don’t
   mean to distract from packs here.

   Wookie December 16, 2014 - 6:58 am

   Hey Lou –

   An idea: I’ve been flirting with buying one of these for years now. I
   think I’m getting close – but the weight and cost are my limiting
   factors. I know they make me safer, but they also make me heavier and
   will make me poor. No – both those things are NOT worth my life – but
   my life is not 100% certain to be lost – but the added weight and cost
   are 100% certain to be expended….

   What percentage of Wildsnow readers are using an airbag pack today?
   This is interesting to me because if these things have become
   mainstream in my peer group – then it is likely that any changes in
   design are likely to be incremental rather than revolutionary. If we’ve
   reached that stage – then maybe waiting one more year wouldn’t bring
   the kind of improvements we’ve seen thus far.

   Also – any weight weenies out there who have truly been converted?
   What’s your experience?
   Reply

   Lou Dawson 2 December 16, 2014 - 7:12 am

   Wookie, I actually think the pace of change will soon pick up. Why?
   These are expensive items that can be pretty cheap to manufacture, thus
   good margins and the different sellers will compete like dogs for
   market share. How to compete? Make the lightest and most user friendly.
   Quite simple, really. I still think the battery operated packs have
   potential to win the race, but they need to be several pounds lighter
   to do so. It’s actually kinda weird they ended up so heavy — perhaps
   has something to do with the CE certification which is biased to the
   compressed gas systems.

   Also, know that the compressed gas way of inflating a balloon is
   subject to revision. There may be chemical ways of producing the gas
   (as with automotive), or perhaps it could be eliminated entirely by a
   spring or compressed foam system. What is more, The volume of the gas
   tanks could easily be tripled and still maintain a reasonably sized
   backpack. That means perhaps a lower pressure and larger tank could be
   used, perhaps made of fabric and built into the pack as part of the
   frame. And so on.

   Truly, if you wanted the amazingly light airbag you’d just have Dyneema
   one that inflated with an explosive charge like automotive. I’ll bet
   they could get that down to just a few ounces weight. Practical? Able
   to be CE certified? Air travel? Who knows.

   Sky is the limit when the economic incentives are there.

   Avalanche avoidance is what I was taught, over 30 years ago. Not
   prediction (despite all the pits and assessments which do make sense).
   And I am a huge fan of airbags, because as others have said, even the
   most experienced are surprised (and die). Don’t underestimate the value
   of your life to your loved ones.

   Many thanks for all you do here at Wildsnow.

   Lou Dawson 2 January 7, 2015 - 1:22 am

   Andy, yeah, we should all be careful with the English language when it
   comes to this. AVOIDANCE is the operative word. Glad you see the idea
   behind airbags, but unfortunately the popular view is they are much
   more effective than in reality. The media (probably including me) are
   not very helpful with this. The panting coverage of airbags over the
   past few years has been rather ridiculous. Thing is, if someone
   survives an avy, and they use an airbag, how do they really know the
   airbag was cause of their survival? Nice it happened, but it could have
   been pure luck, fate, or whatever. So trotting out the avalanche
   survivors to talk about how their airbag worked, or publishing videos,
   all very misleading. I advocate using the airbags of course, and will
   continue to cover them here at WildSnow, but we should all try to tone
   down the shouting about how they supposedly make a quantum leap in
   avalanche safety. Lou

   Why does an avalanche airbag have to be connected to a pack? Downsides
   of a pack include both forgetting to attach the crotch strap, as well
   as possibly being hit by a second slide, after removing the pack to
   access shovel & probe.

   Would it not be better to attach an airbag system to a body harness,
   perhaps an extension of the light weight harness now in use for glacier
   travel?

   Doesn’t the military have something like this for pilots ditching in
   the ocean?

   Anybody working on this idea?

   Just wondering.
   Reply

   Lou Dawson 2 October 11, 2015 - 7:16 am

   Atfred, many of us have thought of that. I’d imagine someone out there
   is working on it. Pretty simple, really. Only problem is the backpack
   can’t cover up the airbag deployment.

   The viable solution for the crotch strap is all ski touring pants
   should have a crotch strap built-in that you simply clip and unclip
   from the airbag rucksack via a single clip-buckle that’s neatly located
   up in the hip pocket area. This in my view is essential and needs to be
   done ASAP in the industry. Having the crotch strap dangling, catching
   on things, and needing more fiddling around when removing pack during
   breaks and such, bogus, pretty much 1940s technology.

   Sigh, always amazing how long this basic stuff takes to improve. I
   mean, a crotch strap isn’t a digital 3-antenna beacon. It’s a chunk of
   nylon and a buckle.

   Thanks Lou,

   perhaps some day we’ll all have a “PAB” – personal air bag – a thin
   full body suit with sensors to detect imminent danger (trauma, etc.),
   upon which the suit inflates and you become a human Pillsbury dough
   boy!

   Maybe Patagonia is working on that (?!)

   until now. Quite a difference……. Get an airbag on your back! If it’s
   too heavy or u can’t afford it, don’t go into the back country in any
   part of the world at any time. Simple. Done. Thanks guys. This is
   coming from 20 years experience in the mountains every day. C ya.

Black Diamond AvaLung Recall — Limited Portion of 2010 Backpacks

   by Lou Dawson December 14, 2010
   written by Lou Dawson December 14, 2010

     Big thanks to Backcountry Access for sponsoring this avalanche
     education content. Check out the additional plethora of avalanche
     safety resources on their website.

     Editor’s note: Some product recalls are kept on the down low so as
     not to generate bad PR for the company in question. But an AvaLung
     recall probably would have been media shouted no matter what. So
     kudos to BD for working with a variety of media folks to get the
     word out in bold print this morning, accurately. Thus, below I
     re-print their announcement and provide links to their recall
     website and PDF document. Oh, and my take? Read carefully; if your
     ‘Lung backpack falls under the parameters of the recall (based on a
     number you’ll find inside the pack) send it in. But know this is NOT
     all AvaLungs, only certain manufacturing runs clarified in BD’s
     recall document and on their website. BD’s document says the
     replacement will happen in March, so I’m assuming that means those
     of you whose packs do have the PO numbers dictating replacement will
     be without an AvaLung for 8 to 12 weeks. That’s a big downside of
     course, so please let us know via the comments if you do have a
     backpack that falls under the parameters of the recall, and how
     you’ll be dealing with that as a consumer.

   December 14, 2010 (Salt Lake City, Utah) – Black Diamond Equipment, a
   leading global climbing and freeride ski brand, is making a voluntarily
   announced recall of a limited portion of 2010 Black Diamond AvaLung
   Packs because of a possibility that the intake tubing may crack under
   cold temperatures.

   AvaLung recall document page, see links above and below for complete
   document if you need it. Click image to enlarge.

   “While we have not experienced a single safety issue related to this
   recall, we are aggressively pursuing the return of all potentially
   affected units,” explains Peter Metcalf, Black Diamond Equipment CEO.
   “The AvaLung has saved multiple lives over the years and we cannot
   accept a hint of doubt in its ability to perform when needed.”

   The recall pertains to a limited manufacturing run of Black Diamond
   AvaLung Packs produced in 2010, which can be identified by a PO number
   and model combination presented on the Black Diamond website.

   Any AvaLung Pack that falls within the announced criteria is part of
   the recall and contains and AvaLung unit that should be immediately
   returned to Black Diamond Equipment for inspection and/or replacement.
   Not all AvaLung Packs from these PO numbers have a faulty AvaLung unit,
   but this determination must be made in-house.

   Instructions to identify AvaLung Pack PO numbers are available at
   www.BlackDiamondEquipment.com/AvaLungRecall. After determining that a
   2010 AvaLung Pack has one of these PO numbers, Black Diamond requests
   that consumers:
   a) Print out the required return form from
   www.BlackDiamondEquipment.com/AvaLungRecall (or the PDF linked at the
   bottom of this blog post.)
   b) Remove the AvaLung unit from your pack and return it to Black
   Diamond for inspection (see site for detailed video explanation)
   c) Or, if do not wish to remove the AvaLung unit yourself, return the
   entire pack to Black Diamond to have the AvaLung unit inspected.

   “We at Black Diamond apologize both for the inconvenience and the
   resource footprint of this recall,” says Nathan Kuder, Black Diamond’s
   Softgoods Category Director. “The mere possibility that the AvaLung
   could potentially fail makes this an easy decision for us. Because the
   AvaLung plays an important role in avalanche protocol we want this
   recall effort to be 100% successful.”

   For help identifying potentially affected 2010 AvaLung Packs, return
   instructions or questions on the status of a replacement, please
   contact Black Diamond at  (801) 278-5533

   Black Diamond is a class act. To paraphrase what one of their testers
   said, “My job is to keep my friends from dying.”
   Caleb P. December 14, 2010 - 12:34 pm

   Well, I just checked my Covert and yes its one of the ones. I’ll be
   sending mine in right away. It wont change my skiing, I don’t think
   anyone should take greater risk just because they have more tools. Hey
   on the bright side I’ll be a bit lighter on the up now. Thanks to BD
   for catching this and taking care of it. Actually I wonder if this will
   fix my issue with the mouth piece. Its a bit crooked and doesn’t sit
   angled just right with my mouth. Its still usable, however I have to
   flex the tube and sort of crimp it rotationally to line it up. It’s
   like it needs a quarter turn or so. Perhaps this is the issue? Anyone
   know?
   Lou December 14, 2010 - 12:54 pm

   Caleb, good you’re taking it like a man (grin). The issue is the intake
   tube possibly cracking when it’s quite cold. As for your mouthpiece,
   I’d imagine when they fix the ‘Lung you’ll end up with a new one of
   those, but who knows.

   Caleb P. December 14, 2010 - 2:16 pm

   Lou, I just took the tube out and realized if I flipped the entire
   thing over (so the intake box is rotated 180 degrees from how i got it)
   the tube seems to line up properly. Maybe thats how it was supposed to
   be installed, I don’t know, but when I get it back thats how I’m going
   to put it back in. I wouldn’t think it would have any affect either way
   on the performance……

   Caleb Wray December 14, 2010 - 5:19 pm

   Got my new Anarchist in the mail last week. Skied with it in Marble
   yesterday. Found out today that it’s recalled. Leaving for Ecuador on
   Saturday. Grrrrr! I think I will just risk it until I get back and then
   deal with the issue, since I don’t really have an alternative. I will
   let you know how the process goes.

   Scott December 14, 2010 - 11:21 pm

   Just received my covert pack. I have been trying to make the investment
   into an avalung system for a couple years now and of course mine is
   also recalled. LAME! BD seems like an ok company and definitely has the
   market cornered with many of their products but this is not the first
   time i have dealt with quality control issues from BD. BD, get it
   together please.

   Pablo December 15, 2010 - 4:20 am

   Hi Lou. ¿Do you know if this involves to the european stuff or only to
   the american? I ignore if BD manufatures in diferent countries for
   american and european market.

   Thanks a lot for all that important info.

   Bob Coleman December 15, 2010 - 11:44 am

   Sent the avalung part back yesterday. Their instructions on removal of
   the avalung tube are clear and accurate. My guess is they have known
   about this for quite a while. My pack says made in Philippines, but I
   wonder where the avalung pieces are made? Upon receiving the pack a few
   months ago the potential brittleness of the blue tube seemed obvious to
   me…..

   Too, I wish they would have checked their web sales. They would know
   those purchasers off the top, saving the trouble of mailing either the
   pack or parts back. Since they aren’t replacing until March; any
   avalung part is better than none.

   Caleb Wray December 17, 2010 - 1:53 pm

   Got this email from Backcountry.com, the place I purchased my
   Anarchist. I have always had good experiences with Backcountry.com, and
   I have had many. I thought this was a “go the extra mile” effort on
   their part.
