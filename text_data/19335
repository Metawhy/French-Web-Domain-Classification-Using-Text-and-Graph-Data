So Much Has Happened

   As you have noticed, those of you that follow this blog, I have been
   "MIA" for quite a while. I post more regularly on my new blog
   www.teresakogut.com so please join me over there :)
   My last post was August 2014.....so much has happened since then. The
   last half of 2014 was not so good. My sweet endearing Dad fought and
   lost his battle with cancer Dec 18th and life as I knew it will never
   be the same. I have never experience that deep deep grief. I am doing
   better these days but I think of him throughout every day and visit him
   in my dreams. I am blessed to have my faith to lean on and help me
   through such devastating life events. I seriously don't know how people
   without faith cope. A few weeks ago I attended another family member's
   funeral and the pastor said something that really stuck with me,
   "Grieve, but don't grieve like those without hope".  I have hope. Hope
   to see my Dad again one day in paradise. I miss him terribly but I know
   he's right where God wants him; at rest, in peace, with Him.

   In January of 2015, Dawn and Dick Rossell, shopkeepers of Holly Hills
   Primitives (HHP), asked if I would like to open a "shop within a shop".
   I immediately said YES! They also invited Kris Miller of Spruce Ridge
   Studios to do the same so now Kris and I share a large room inside HHP.
   Below are some photos of our new shop!

    -------------------------------------------------------
   We have a new family member. Athena joined us just yesterday. She is a
   7 month old lab-pitbull-boxer mix. She is smart as a whip! Our friend's
   son, Vinnie, was sad to have to give her to us but he is moving and
   couldn't take her with him. Well, he found her a good home. She will be
   spoiled here and will have 5 acres to run and play. It's been a long
   time since I had a puppy....I forgot how much attention they need!
   (btw....Daisy and the chickens aren't too thrilled)

   Those are the three major changes in my life since last August. I will
   try to post more often. Blessings to you all!

Annual Friends Weekend

   [Sunset%2BAug2014.jpg]
   Every summer for the past 9 or 10 years (we haven't, so far, been able
   to figure out what year we started doing this) several of us escape to
   northern Michigan for a few days of fun and relaxation. Kevin and I are
   very blessed to have many great friends to share this thing called
   life. Wikipedia states it perfectly:
   "Friendship is a relationship of mutual affection between two or more
   people. Friendship is a stronger form of interpersonal bond than an
   association. A World Happiness Database study found that people with
   close friendships are happier.
   Although there are many forms of friendship, some of which may vary
   from place to place, certain characteristics are present in many types
   of friendship. Such characteristics include affection, sympathy,
   empathy, honesty, altruism, mutual understanding and compassion,
   enjoyment of each other's company, trust, and the ability to be
   oneself, express one's feelings, and make mistakes without fear of
   judgment from the friend."
   [The%2Bguys%2B2014.jpg]
   Paul, Kevin, Bill, Roger and Bob
   [the%2Bgirls%2B2014.jpg]
    Keri, Me, Amy, Lisa, Theresa & Renee
   I hope you, too, are lucky enough to be surrounded by great friends.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY, KYLE!

   Twenty one years ago, God blessed us with our first-born son. We've
   been through many ups and downs but we came out the other side closer
   than if we hadn't went through all that we did. I thank God every day
   for our children. They make my life complete.

saying goodbye...for now

   [My+Kitty+Feb+24.jpg]
   [efadc931766f137b5abc08d29a34bfb8.jpg]

                 [Screen+Shot+2014-01-07+at+2.55.36+PM.png]
          This photo was taken the day she passed. She was so sick.

   Well friends, it's with a heavy heart that I tell you we lost our
   little sweet kitty yesterday. She was with us for 20 years! She will be
   missed.
   She joined our family as a stray when Kyle was about 2 years old, so we
   really don't know how hold she was. I had never had a cat before so she
   hung out a few days in the tree in our side yard until we made a
   decision whether to keep her or not. We just couldn't resist her
   cuteness so decided to make her part of the family. I didn't know if
   she had fleas, ticks or any other "issues" so we kept her outside one
   more night until I could take her to the vet the next morning. Well,
   overnight she got in a tussle with some other creature because she had
   a puncture wound at the base of her tail....which made her tail curl up
   like a pug's tail, haha! It was one of her cute traits. My uncle came
   to visit from Missouri a few years after we had her and asked me,
   "What's your cat's name, Seymour Butts?"
   Which brings me to the next oddity about our little kitty. Her name was
   Kitty Girl....I know, original, huh? Well, that's what she would come
   to when she was a stray for those few days before joining the family.
   We thought and thought of other names but she would only acknowledge
   "Kitty Girl". (how many other cats do you know that got to choose their
   own name?) However, at the vet's office she was known as "Mittens"
   because I felt silly having them call her Kitty Girl! lol.
   She really was a sweet kitty...kind to everyone...well except Buster.
   She would swat at him if he got to close, but all along, I think that
   was her way of playing with him.
   I know when we get to heaven, we will see all of our beloved pets
   again. What a joyous occasion that will be <3 p="">
   Blessings,
   Teresa
