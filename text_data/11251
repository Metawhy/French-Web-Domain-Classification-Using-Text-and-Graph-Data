A Beginners Guide To Search Engine Optimization Or Seo

   June 30, 2018 Leave a comment Lee Mitchelle

   Search Engine Optimization (or SEO) is an online marketing technique
   focused on growing visibility in search engine results. It’s both a
   science and an art that is employed to drive traffic to, and awareness
   of, a website. It isnt just about making your website more
   search-friendly, its also about making your website better for viewers
   as well.

   These tweaks to a website are usually small. They often come in the
   form of keywords and certain phrases that are relevant to the sites
   identity and purpose.

   Why is it necessary?

   Since most of the web traffic is driven by search engines like Google
   or Bing, it’s important that you get noticed by placing high up in the
   rankings of the search engine results pages (SERPs) of these search
   engines. Lets look at an example:

   You’re a company that sells gadgets and other tech products online. If
   someone searches gadgets store on a search engine, you would want to
   place high up (preferably in first place) in the search results. This
   is because most people visit the pages that the search engines find
   most relevant. That relevance is what SEO tries to improve on in your
   website.

   Even though search engines are smart, they need help from the website.
   Certain keywords are used in connection with the search query to drive
   the search page results. Search engines are improving their technology
   all the time in order to provide better and more accurate search
   results. All of this targeted traffic makes it more necessary for SEO
   to be implemented on any website, if there’s any hope it will be seen
   by, and reach a lot of people.

   How can I do SEO?

   SEO is very complex. The basics discussed above only scratch the
   surface of what SEO means and what it can do. There are many firms out
   there that provide services to businesses, so that these businesses
   websites have been optimized to place high in the SERPS. This isnt to
   say that you cant do it yourself. If one is willing to put in the time
   and effort to learn more, visit this page for more information about
   SEO.

   Learning SEO can be a bit tricky, but a firm grasp of its concepts is
   really all that most people need to drive traffic to their websites.
   However, like any marketing strategy, doing it well is just as
   important as being knowledgeable about it.

   One last thing you have to keep in mind is that SEO alone is not enough
   to get your page to where you want it to be. Things like the interface
   and customer experience on a website are just as important. You wouldnt
   want your page to be visited only to get discarded because a potential
   customer cant understand your website.
