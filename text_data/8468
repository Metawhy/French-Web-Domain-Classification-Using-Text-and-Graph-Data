Apache Edgent (incubating)

   Apache Edgent is a programming model and micro-kernel style runtime
   that can be embedded in gateways and small footprint edge devices
   enabling local, real-time, analytics on the continuous streams of data
   coming from equipment, vehicles, systems, appliances, devices and
   sensors of all kinds (for example, Raspberry Pis or smart phones).
   Working in conjunction with centralized analytic systems, Apache Edgent
   provides efficient and timely analytics across the whole IoT ecosystem:
   from the center to the edge.

Video Analytics at the Edge: Fun with Apache Edgent, OpenCV and a Raspberry
Pi

Tuesday May 16, 2017 • 2:30pm - 3:20pm EST

Venue: Michaelangelo

Presenters: William Marshall & Dale LaBossiere, IBM

   Apache Edgent (incubating) is a streaming programming model and runtime
   designed to accelerate the development of analytics on small edge
   devices or gateways. Enabling streaming analytics on edge devices can
   reduce the load on data center and communication costs. Furthermore,
   edge analytics can reduce decision making latency and enable device
   autonomy. Edgent uses a functional API to compose processing pipelines
   with immediate per-tuple computation, and also provides a suite of
   connectors which greatly ease communication with a backend. This
   presentation introduces Apache Edgent and provides a video analytics
   use case to illustrate its programming model and capabilities.

Having fun with Raspberry(s) and Apache Projects

Wednesday, May 17 • 12:15pm - 1:05pm EST

Venue: Sandringham

Presenter: Jean-Frederic Clere, Red Hat

   You can do a lot with a Raspberry and ASF projects. From a Tiny object
   connected to Internet to a small server application.
     * Raspberry as a IoT Sensor collecting data and sending it to
       ActiveMQ.
     * Raspberry as a Modbus supervisor controlling an Industruino
       (Insdustrial Arduino) and connected to ActiveMQ.
     * Using Apache edgent with same :D

Hangout: Apache Edgent on Raspberry Pi

Thursday, May 12 10am-11am PDT

   In this Google+ Hangout, we showed you how you can use Edgent to work
   with real sensor data on a Raspberry Pi. We also demonstrated an
   application where we implemented a smart sprinkler system using Apache
   Edgent, Raspberry Pi, Watson IoT Platform and the Streaming Analytics
   service.

Hangout: Intro to Apache Edgent

Wednesday, April 13 10am-12pm PDT

   In this Google+ Hangout, the committers presented a high-level overview
   of the Apache Edgent project and demonstrated how you can write,
   monitor and debug your Edgent application. They also showed you how you
   can get involved and contribute to the Edgent community.

An Open IoT Ecosystem

   Apache Edgent is API driven and modular and can be used in conjunction
   with vendor and open source data and analytics solutions such as Apache
   Kafka, Apache Spark and Apache Storm.

Why Apache Edgent?

Reduced Communication Costs

   Edgent performs real-time analytics on the edge device, separating the
   interesting from the mundane, so you don’t have to send every sensor
   reading over a network. If 99% of readings are normal, Edgent detects
   the 1% anomalies and just transmits those for further processing.

Local and Faster Time to Action

   Edgent makes devices more intelligent, enabling them to take immediate
   action. For example, a connected vehicle running Edgent can adjust
   traction control based on the weight of the cargo/passengers.

Learning From Related Devices

   Edgent enables connected devices to learn from related devices. For
   example, a truck maneuvering roads in Oregon can adjust based on the
   data received from trucks operating under similar loads and conditions
   in Colorado; data such as altitude, cargo, weather and traffic
   conditions.

   Apache Edgent is an effort undergoing Incubation at The Apache Software
   Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Incubator. Incubation is required of
   all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the
   infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have
   stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.
   While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the
   completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the
   project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
