Welcome to Singapore

   Since its independence in 1959, Singapore has become one of the world's
   wealthiest and healthiest economic centres. This vibrant, cosmopolitan
   city is one of the Four Asian Tigers and home to over 5 million people.
   The World Bank has called Singapore "the world's easiest place to do
   business". The country's success is based in large part on its openness
   to business and its emphasis on tolerance and respect.

SP Jain Campus

   SP Jain's seven-acre Singapore campus is located close to downtown and
   is easily accessible by car or public transport. The campus' renovated
   heritage building house houses the Faculty offices, Accommodation,
   Marketing & Admission offices, classrooms, lounge, banquet hall &
   cafeteria. The non-heritage building (former dental college) houses the
   student hostel, classrooms, Faculty offices and Leadership hall.

   The cafeteria offers a variety of multinational cuisine to cater to the
   diverse student community.
   Students can stay healthy by exercising in the gym or playing sports,
   such as basketball or table tennis. They can also take long
   walks around the campus or on the Mt. Faber Sky Walk, located just
   outside the campus.

LEARNING CENTRES


   There are seven classrooms and learning centres (or lecture halls) in
   the Singapore campus. The rooms range in siting capacity from 30 to 76
   and are equipped with audio-visual equipment, internet drops, and at
   most times, wireless network coverage. Students also get to enjoy the
   use of the school library with a study area and study breakout rooms
   for group discussions or self-revisions.

   areas like a TV lounge and group work areas. Hostel facilities include:
