Who we are

   The Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity (CRI) experiments and
   spreads new ways of learning, teaching, conducting research and
   mobilizing collective intelligence in life, learning and digital
   sciences.
   It was founded in 2005 by Fran√ßois Taddei and Ariel Lindner. The
   Bettencourt Schueller Foundation has been an essential and key
   supporting partner since the CRI was created.

   Description

   There has been increasing demand for in-person language lessons or a
   language exchange between native and novice speakers of French and
   English. If you would like to improve your spoken French and/or English
   and are willing to help others, then this exchange is for you. The
   level of the course will be up to the people interested ‚Äì we may just
   meet periodically to talk over beers, focus on science language
   specifically, or organize formal lessons. If you are interested please
   register on Google classroom and we will plan the course from there.

   Organization

   Dates: To be determined based on number of students interested
   Credits/Validation: TBD

Postmortem game jam redwire.io

   By ac In Hot News, News On August 11, 2014
     __________________________________________________________________

   Creating games from scratch is hard. What if we could ‚Äúremix‚Äù existing
   games, just like we do for music?

   redwire-cropped

   That was the aim of the RedWire game jam that took place in Paris over
   the weekend of July 25-27. The event was a collaboration between four
   organizations: the Center for Interdisciplinary Research (CRI) has been
   developing RedWire;Jam Shaker organizes game jams on a monthly
   basis; Mozilla encourages and supports people to develop new things for
   the web; and the Gamelier is a game development club who run a variety
   of game events in Paris related to game, science and education.

   logo_01___1020b.png

   RedWire is a new online game engine made specifically for remixing and
   mashing up games. Unlike other engines, the focus is on making
   individual parts like bricks that can be put together without conflicts
   and fitting each other. RedWire is an open source project, and all the
   games made on it are open source as well. When you find a game you
   like, you can examine how it‚Äôs made, fork it, make your own version and
   drag and drop parts of other games to remix them.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/GRcn9qrarOQ?feature=oembed

   We organized a very unusual event! Most game jams have a very similar
   format : a theme is announced at the start, participants brainstorm and
   present their ideas, and then they form groups around the ideas that
   they want to work on. From then on, everyone stays with their team in
   their own corner until the games are presented at the end of the jam.

   Because we wanted to focus on remixing games, we decided to take a
   radically different approach, separated into three phases. On Friday
   night, I presented a short tutorial on how to use RedWire. Then, the
   whole group brainstormed ideas for gameplay ‚Äúbricks‚Äù that we could
   create and reuse in a variety of games. Most of Saturday was taken up
   translating those ideas into runnable code on RedWire. Starting Sunday
   night, we came up with complete game ideas that involved assembling
   those bricks. Sunday was about finally creating those games and demoing
   them in front of the others.

   IMG_0082

   Around 20 people showed up over weekend. For the most part, they were
   programmers, but with varying levels of experience in different
   languages.

   What came out of it? Here are a few of the gameplay bricks that we
   programmed:
     * Tileset system to generate backgrounds from
     * Score counter
     * Falling blocks: Blocks with letters on them fall from the top of
       the screen. Pressing the corresponding letters gains you points
     * Menu that you navigate with your keyboard
     * A psychedelic animation that changes color schemes with every mouse
       click or keypress
     * Teleporting enemies that disappear and reappear
     * Dialog system with image and HTML text

   I was fun to see the games that resulted from these blocks. Click on
   the links below to play the games:

   ‚Äì Two sides, by Alexis Moroz and Hugo Hilaire: The player must destroy
   as many enemies as possible as they travel across the screen. Then the
   player joins the other camp, and replays the same sequence, but this
   time carefully avoiding all the projectiles that they fired off in the
   previous sequence.

   ‚Äì Soundefender, by Maxence Bouhenic, Clement Jacob and Clement
   Bourgoin: A game for two players, in which one uses the mouse to target
   enemies and the other fires. Hovering over an enemy with the mouse
   plays one of 3 sounds (low, high, or medium) and the player controlling
   the keyboard must respond with the same sound in order to destroy the
   enemy.

   ‚Äì Je de doigts, by Ga√´tan Vergeot and Donat Bihr: 2 players work
   together to hold down the keyboard keys for the letters that have
   fallen to the bottom of the screen. New letters keeping falling and
   replace the old ones, forcing the players to do a  fun ‚Äúkeyboard dance‚Äù
   of sorts.

   ‚Äì Home, by R√©mi Leblanc and William Huam: A space shooter in which you
   must carefully pick between the enemies and neutral ships. The only
   difficulty is that they look identical.

   But my favorite is a remix of a remix. Alexandre Vaugoux took
   Soundefender and added his SYKIK layer on top of it to yield SYKIK
   Soundefender.

   In one action-packed weekend, we learned quite a bit about RedWire. We
   were happy to find that ‚Äúcircuits‚Äù, self contained blocks that have
   their own logic and memory, worked well for sharing between games.
   Another feature was the sound support, which lead to some really
   excellent sounds generated by jsfx. On the downside, people had trouble
   understanding how exactly the engine is executing the code. Many
   expected that the chips would be executed in order rather than
   concurrently. Also, they didn‚Äôt get how to pass information from one
   chip to another.

   Coming off from the jam, we are considering a bunch of changes: a means
   to chain multiple chips in sequence, a more JavaScript-like way of
   wiring chips together, and integrated collision detection routines.
   Finally the most requested improvement was extending the standard
   library of chips to include the most common operations, including
   drawing shapes, detecting collisions, and reacting to user input.

   Thanks to everyone who participated in the jam, the project is going to
   evolve much faster in the next few months.  For more information about
   RedWire, check out our tumblr blog and follow us at @RedWireIO. Or just
   get started making your own game.
