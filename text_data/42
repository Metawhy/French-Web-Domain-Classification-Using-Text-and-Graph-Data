   CADP ("Construction and Analysis of Distributed Processes", formerly
   known as "CAESAR/ALDEBARAN Development Package") is a popular toolbox
   for the design of asynchronous concurrent systems, such as
   communication protocols, distributed systems, asynchronous circuits,
   multiprocessor architectures, web services, etc.

   Since January 2012, CADP is developed by the CONVECS team (formerly, by
   the VASY team). CADP is connected to various complementary tools. CADP
   is maintained, regularly improved, and used in many industrial
   projects.
   CADP offers a wide set of functionalities, ranging from step-by-step
   simulation to massively parallel model-checking. It is the only toolbox
   to offer:
     * Compilers for several input formalisms, e.g.:
          + High-level descriptions written in various languages, such as
            LOTOS (ISO International Standard 8807), LNT, FSP,
            pi-calculus, etc. The CADP toolbox provides compilers (CAESAR,
            CAESAR.ADT, LNT2LOTOS, FSP2LOTOS, etc.) that translate
            high-level descriptions into C code to be used for simulation,
            verification, and testing purposes;
          + Low-level descriptions specified as automata (i.e., finite
            state machines) and networks of communicating automata that
            run in parallel, synchronize, and communicate using process
            algebra operators or synchronization vectors.
     * Several equivalence checking tools (minimization and comparisons
       modulo bisimulation relations), such as BCG_MIN and BISIMULATOR.
     * Several model-checkers for various temporal logic and mu-calculus,
       such as EVALUATOR and XTL.
     * Several verification algorithms combined together: enumerative
       verification, on-the-fly verification, symbolic verification using
       binary decision diagrams, compositional minimization, partial
       orders, distributed model checking, etc.
     * Plus a bunch of other tools with advanced functionalities such as
       visual checking, performance evaluation, etc.

   CADP is designed in a modular way and puts the emphasis on intermediate
   formats and programming interfaces (such as the BCG and OPEN/CAESAR
   software environments), which allow the CADP tools to be combined with
   other tools and adapted to various specification languages.
