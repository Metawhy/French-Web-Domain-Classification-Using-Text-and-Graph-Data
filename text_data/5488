     * Innovative pharmaceutical products for human reproductive health.
    We develop new solutions in the field of human fertility (for both men
       and women) and Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART).

Igyxos’ mission is to develop innovative new pharmaceuticals and medical
technologies in the field of human fertility.

Igyxos is involved in all phases of development, from the discovery of
promising targets to the identification of potential lead compounds such as
small molecules and antibodies, and the acquisition of intellectual property
rights to drugs and technologies that can then be brought to the development
phase.

Igyxos also support the transfer of potential drug candidates to pre-clinical
and clinical phases of drug development.
