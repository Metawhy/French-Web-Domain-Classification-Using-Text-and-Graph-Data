   The Public Data Lab seeks to facilitate research, democratic engagement
   and public debate around the future of the data society.

   We want to develop and disseminate innovative research, teaching,
   design and participation formats for the creation and use of public
   data.

   We work in collaboration with an interdisciplinary network of
   researchers, practitioners, journalists, civil society groups,
   designers, developers and public institutions across the world.

   Our approach characterized by an interest in:
     * Intervention around social, political, economic and ecological
       issues;
     * Participation through involving different publics in the co-design
       of our work;
     * Artisanship in advancing the craft of developing data projects and
       experiences;
     * Openness in sharing our research, data and code for all to use.

What we do

     * Undertake exemplary research and data projects;
     * Foster awareness and critical reflection on data infrastructures;
     * Promote public understanding and engagement with data politics;
     * Advance digital methods, tools and code;
     * Develop participatory design methods;
     * Catalyse transnational and transdisciplinary collaborations;
     * Map and facilitate the translation of data practices between
       domains.

About us

   A mirage is shimmering across the world: the hope that the advent of
   massive digitisation and datafication will enable evidence-based
   policy-making and the effective public management of all uncertainties
   and challenges. This hope is not new. It dates back to the invention of
   statistics and has surfaced again and again every time technical
   innovation has supplied new information on collective life.

   Yet, as policymakers know all too well, this hope is misplaced. The
   problem of governance is seldom the lack of information. Living
   together is difficult not because we ignore what others do or want, but
   because we have different aspirations, interests and visions. More
   data, no matter how big or smart, will not make the task of composing
   our diverging interests any easier.

   This does not mean, of course, that there is no political use for
   digital technologies. It means that they can have more uses than we
   imagine. Massive datasets and sophisticated models are not the only
   tools digital technologies can offer. These technologies also
   facilitate the traceability of social phenomena and open up new ways to
   map different different kinds of political agendas and to expose them
   to public investigation.

   The Public Data Lab develops collaborative research, teaching, design
   and participation formats to facilitate societal debates through
   digital technologies. It holds that data should not be used to close
   the discussion, but to open spaces for deliberation, engagement and
   contestation. Data analysis is not a magic bullet, nor an inexhaustible
   source of consensus and rational decision-making. Rather, it is rather
   a heterogeneous ensemble of experimental and tentative techniques to
   explore and chart our divergences. Not necessarily to solve them, but
   at least to make them more legible.

   In our data-sprints, issue experts, researchers, developers and
   designers collaborate with the representatives of different civic
   constituencies to develop debatable data, digital methods and public
   spaces around the infrastructures of data and processes of
   datafication.
