Transportation Research Institute

   The Transportation Research Institute conducts interdisciplinary
   research to address the mobility, safety, and environmental challenges
   of a rapidly evolving transportation ecosystem.

   The UA's Transportation Research Institute, or TRI, is equipped with
   the interdisciplinary expertise necessary to address the challenges of
   an ever-evolving transportation ecosystem.

   The TRI was established in 2016 and succeeds ATLAS, an
   engineering-focused research center UA launched in 1998 to advance
   transportation.

   Today, the “transportation ecosystem," as it is referred to, is much
   more complex. To be successful in creating innovative solutions to
   transportation problems, the TRI needs to consider mobility, safety,
   and the environment all at once. For example, the average urban
   commuter in the United States lost 42 hours stuck in traffic congestion
   last year, causing an estimated cost of $160 billion, which includes
   lost productivity, gas burned while idling, and wear and tear on
   vehicles. Likewise, in 2015, there were roughly 34,000 fatal car
   accidents in the United States, and more than 3,000 of those were
   related to texting.

   As the second state to authorize legislation for autonomous vehicle
   testing, after Nevada, the state of Arizona now has the opportunity to
   create economic growth while addressing a national challenge. With the
   Transportation Research Institute, the UA has positioned itself to lead
   these efforts statewide.

New Study Presents 1st Genome Sequence of Florida Panther

   Oct. 2, 2019

   A University of Arizona researcher and a UA alumnus are part of the
   team that is the first to sequence the genome of the Florida panther,
   and they’ve found evidence of increased genetic variation in the
   population.
   In the semi-arid forests of the western U.S., increases in rainfall
   extremes – wetter wet years and drier dry years – can lead to long-term
   declines in tree growth, even with no change in average precipitation.

Precipitation Extremes Driving Tree Growth Reductions

   Oct. 1, 2019

   Extreme rainfall variability may cause long-term declines in tree
   growth for many trees in the western U.S., including the ponderosa
   pine, Douglas-fir, piñon pine and bur oak.

   Facilitating and showcasing your research

   UA scientists are using hundreds of years of tree ring data to empower
   Guatemalan farmers, and we wanted the world to know. So we sent RDI's
   award-winning documentarian to Guatemala to capture this important work
   on film.

     RDI is here to help you turn your idea into a world-changing
     outcome, from sharing your stories to helping you find funding
     opportunities and fellow researchers to collaborate with.
