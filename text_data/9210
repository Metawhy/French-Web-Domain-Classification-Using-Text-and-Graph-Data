FDIC Approves Interagency Final Rule to Simplify and Tailor the "Volcker
Rule"

   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
   August 20, 2019
   Media contact:
   David Barr
   (202) 898-6895
   dbarr@fdic.gov

   The Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
   (FDIC) today approved an interagency final rule to simplify and tailor
   requirements relating to Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
   Reform and Consumer Protection Act, commonly known as the "Volcker
   Rule." The Volcker Rule generally prohibits banking entities from
   engaging in proprietary trading and from owning or controlling hedge
   funds or private equity funds.

   "One of the post-crisis reforms that has been most challenging to
   implement for regulators and industry is the Volcker Rule, which
   restricts banks from engaging in proprietary trading and from owning
   hedge funds and private equity funds. Distinguishing between what
   qualifies as proprietary trading and what does not has proven to be
   extremely difficult. Meanwhile, banks that do relatively little trading
   are required to go through substantial compliance exercises to ensure
   that activities that have long been considered traditional banking
   activities do not run afoul of the Volcker Rule," said FDIC Chairman
   Jelena McWilliams.

   In July 2018, the FDIC, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
   Federal Reserve Board, Securities and Exchange Commission, and
   Commodity Futures Trading Commission published proposed amendments
   through a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. The proposal would have
   simplified the 2013 rule by providing more certainty for banking
   entities and tailoring requirements to reflect the size and scope of a
   banking entity's trading activities, while still fulfilling the
   requirements of the law.

   Today's action by the FDIC Board of Directors does not reflect any
   future action by the other agencies responsible for the implementation
   of the Volcker Rule.

   The final rule will:
     * Tailor the rule's compliance requirements based on the size of a
       firm's trading assets and liabilities, with the most stringent
       requirements applied to banking entities with the most trading
       activity;
     * Retain the short-term intent prong of the "trading account"
       definition from the 2013 rule only for banking entities that are
       not, and do not elect to become, subject to the market risk capital
       rule prong;
     * Replace the rebuttable presumption that instruments held for fewer
       than 60 days are covered under the short-term intent prong with a
       rebuttable presumption that instruments held for 60 days or longer
       are not covered;
     * Clarify that banking entities that trade within internal risk
       limits set under the conditions in this final rule are engaged in
       permissible market making or underwriting activity;
     * Streamline the criteria that apply when a banking entity seeks to
       rely on the hedging exemption from the proprietary trading
       prohibition;
     * Limit the impact of the rule on the foreign activities of foreign
       banking organizations; and
     * Simplify the trading activity information that banking entities are
       required to provide to the agencies.

   Upon its publication in the Federal Register, the final rule will have
   an effective date of January 1, 2020, and a compliance date of January
   1, 2021. However, a banking entity may voluntarily comply, in whole or
   in part, with the changes to the rule prior to January 1, 2021.

   Congress created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1933 to
   restore public confidence in the nation's banking system. The FDIC
   insures deposits at the nation's banks and savings associations, 5,362
   as of March 31, 2019. It promotes the safety and soundness of these
   institutions by identifying, monitoring and addressing risks to which
   they are exposed. The FDIC receives no federal tax dollars—insured
   financial institutions fund its operations.
