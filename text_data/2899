Who We Are

What Makes up M·A·C

   M·A·C is the world’s leading professional makeup authority because of
   our unrivalled expertise in makeup ARTISTRY.

   M·A·C celebrates diversity and INDIVIDUALITY – we are for All Ages, All
   Races, All Sexes.

   M·A·C is a proud COMMUNITY of professional makeup artists working
   together to bring our vision to life.

   M·A·C is at the forefront of fashion TRENDSETTING, collaborating with
   leading talents from fashion, art and popular culture. Our Artists
   create trends backstage at fashion weeks around the world.

   M·A·C believes in SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, with initiatives such as VIVA
   GLAM and the M·A·C AIDS Fund at the heart and soul of our unique
   culture

Birth of a Cult:
From Wow to Now!

   All Ages, All Races, All Sexes… A professional makeup brand setting
   trends backstage at fashion weeks around the world. Today, M·A·C means
   so many things to its millions of fans in every corner of the planet,
   but a global beauty phenomenon has to begin somewhere.

   Make-Up Art Cosmetics started life in Toronto, Canada. Makeup artist
   and photographer Frank Toskan and salon owner Frank Angelo became
   frustrated by the lack of makeup that photographed well, so they
   decided to create their own. At first, they made the cosmetics in their
   kitchen and sold them straight from the salon to fellow makeup artists,
   as well as models and photographers. Soon, stylists and fashion editors
   got in on the action. As the magazine credits racked up and
   word-of-mouth popularity grew, the duo launched M·A·C in March 1984
   from a counter in a Toronto department store.

   Their approach was chic utility, with the makeup coming in black pots
   rather than compacts. While other major makeup brands at the time were
   predominantly skincare companies, M·A·C chose instead to establish
   itself as the ultimate colour authority. Professional makeup artists
   manned the counter, an industry first. One of the most popular
   offerings was an intense matte red lipstick, which got a boost with an
   appearance in a photo-shoot of the fast-rising Madonna, later seen
   wearing a M·A·C T-shirt.

   The company took the industry by storm, offering a wide range of
   products that blended street savvy with glamorous style and panache.
   Behind the counter, the M·A·C approach was notably different. Rather
   than driving sales through traditional promotional techniques, M·A·C
   relied on the integrity of its carefully formulated product line.
   Adding to the image was a touch of outrageousness. A company that
   honours individuality and self-expression above all else, it brought a
   brilliant sense of drag and theatre into the sleek M·A·C stores and
   department store counters.

   In 1994, as HIV and AIDS continued to spread across the globe, M·A·C
   made HIV/AIDS organizations the beneficiaries of the company’s
   charitable focus and the M·A·C AIDS Fund was created. To date, the VIVA
   GLAM campaign has raised over $380 million for the fight against
   HIV/AIDS, with spokespeople such as Lady Gaga, Pamela Anderson and
   Nicki Minaj.

   Part of the Estée Lauder Companies since 1994, M·A·C is sold today in
   over 105 countries around the world. It remains committed to developing
   new categories, products and over 50 collections each year, all of
   which continue to serve the demand of consumers and professional makeup
   artists alike.

   Collaborations with adored names from popular culture, art and fashion
   have included such names as Rihanna, Lorde, Proenza Schouler, The Rocky
   Horror Picture Show and Brooke Shields. These continue to enhance
   M·A·C’s relevance and reach to existing fans as well as new ones, while
   our makeup Artists’ rock-steady presence backstage at over 200 fashion
   week shows around the world, working with names from Prabal Gurung to
   Vivienne Westwood, secures the envied status of M·A·C as the world’s
   leading beauty trendsetter.

VIVA GLAM
and the M·A·C AIDS Fund

   “I am the M·A·C Girl!” This provocative slogan announced the first face
   of VIVA GLAM – drag icon RuPaul, resplendent in shiny red leather boots
   and corset. A legendary campaign was born, one that would see many
   different stars and styles over the years, but which would always
   retain at its core that same spirit of irreverence, outrageous style
   and irrepressible love of life.

   Created in 1994, the passionate red VIVA GLAM Lipstick raised money and
   awareness for HIV/AIDS at a time when the pandemic was dramatically
   affecting fashion communities in particular as well as the wider world.
   Then and today, an unprecedented 100% of the purchase price of any VIVA
   GLAM product goes toward the M·A·C AIDS Fund (minus VAT where
   applicable).

   In the two decades that have followed since RuPaul made her billboard
   splash, the galaxy of stars who have fronted the campaign is
   unparalleled, including Lady Gaga, Elton John, Debbie Harry, Boy
   George, Cyndi Lauper, Nicki Minaj, Ricky Martin, Christina Aguilera,
   Dita Von Teese, Shirley Manson, Mary J Blige, Rihanna, Miley Cyrus,
   Ariana Grande, and most recently Taraji P. Henson.

   The M·A·C AIDS Fund itself is a pioneer in HIV/AIDS funding, providing
   financial support to organizations working with underserved regions and
   populations. As the largest corporate non-pharmaceutical giver in the
   arena, the M·A·C AIDS Fund is committed to addressing the link between
   poverty and HIV/AIDS by supporting diverse organizations around the
   world that provide a wide range of services to people living with
   HIV/AIDS. To date, the M·A·C AIDS Fund has raised over $400 million
   exclusively through the sale of M·A·C VIVA GLAM Lipstick and Lipglass
   donating 100 percent of the sale price to fight HIV/AIDS.

   Long live VIVA GLAM! We are all the M·A·C Girl!

       16. General
       You acknowledge and agree that these Terms and Conditions
       constitute the complete and exclusive agreement between us
       concerning your use of the Site, and supersede and govern all prior
       proposals, agreements, or other communications.
       We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms
       and Conditions at any time by posting the changes on the Site and
       providing notice of such change. Any changes are effective
       immediately upon posting to the Site. The Effective Date of the
       current version of the Terms and Conditions is at the top of this
       page. Your continued use of the Site thereafter constitutes your
       agreement to all such changed Terms and Conditions. We may, with or
       without prior notice, terminate any of the rights granted by these
       Terms and Conditions. You shall comply immediately with any
       termination or other notice, including, as applicable, by ceasing
       all use of the Site. We also reserve the right at any time and from
       time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently,
       the Site (or any part thereof) with or without notice.
       Nothing contained in these Terms and Conditions shall be construed
       as creating any agency, partnership, or other form of joint
       enterprise between us. Our failure to require your performance of
       any provision hereof shall not affect our full right to require
       such performance at any time thereafter, nor shall our waiver of a
       breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of
       the provision itself. In the event that any provision of these
       Terms and Conditions shall be unenforceable or invalid under any
       applicable law or be so held by any applicable arbitral award or
       court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not
       render these Terms and Conditions unenforceable or invalid as a
       whole but these Terms and Conditions shall be modified, to the
       extent possible, by the adjudicating entity to most fully reflect
       the original intent of the parties as reflected in the original
       provision. The headings in the Terms and Conditions are for
       convenience only and shall not be used in its interpretation.
       You and M·A·C expressly agree to waive and set aside our respective
       rights and obligations under any applicable law in the event of any
       termination of these Terms and Conditions to the extent that such
       law requires any judicial pronouncement for the termination of
       these Terms and Conditions.
       17. Language
       These Terms and Conditions are made in the English language and the
       Indonesian language. Both texts are equally original. In the event
       of any inconsistency or different interpretation between the
       English text and the Indonesian text, the relevant Indonesian text
       shall be deemed to be automatically amended to conform with and to
       make it consistent with the relevant English text..
       If you have any questions regarding these Terms and Conditions,

   Information We Collect by Automated Means

   When you visit this site, view or click on our online advertisements
   (including our advertisements on third party websites), visit our
   social media pages or download and use one of our mobile applications,
   we also collect certain information about your usage or device by
   automated means or by using technologies such as cookies, web server
   logs and web beacons. For example, if you use one of our mobile
   applications, we may collect your IP address, your unique device
   identifier (or other device identifier) and/or geo-location data in
   order to offer you certain features or functionalities within that
   mobile application. As set forth in more detail below, we may also
   collect information about your usage and browsing habits using various
   web-based technologies.

   For your convenience, our mobile applications may also include
   functionality that allows you to remain logged in to the application so
   that you do not have to reenter a password each time you want to access
   the application. IF YOU CHOOSE TO REMAIN LOGGED IN, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE
   THAT ANYONE WITH ACCESS TO YOUR MOBILE DEVICE WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS
   AND MAKE CHANGES TO YOUR MOBILE ACCOUNT AND MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE
   PURCHASES THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT. For that reason, if you choose to
   remain logged in to the application on your mobile device, we strongly
   recommend you enable the Passcode Lock security feature on your mobile
   device to protect against unauthorized access to and use of your mobile
   device and your account in the application.
   Technologies We Use

   Cookies, Web Server Logs and Web Beacons

   Cookies are small text files that websites send to your computer or
   other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to
   store information or settings in your browser. Your browser may tell
   you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies and
   how to restrict or disable certain cookies. Please note, however, that
   without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our
   website.

   In conjunction with obtaining information through cookies, our web
   servers may log details such as your operating system type, browser
   type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your
   system uses and the country and time zone in which your device is
   located. The web server logs also may record information such as the
   address of the web page that linked you to our site and the IP address
   of the device you use to connect to the Internet.

   To control which web servers collect this information, we may place
   tags on our web pages called “web beacons.” These are computer
   instructions that link web pages to particular web servers and their
   cookies.

   Third Party Web Analytics Services
   We may use third party web analytics services on this site, our social
   network pages, or our mobile applications, such as those of Adobe Site
   Catalyst and/or Google Analytics. The service providers that administer
   these services use technologies such as cookies, web server logs and
   web beacons to collect information (such as IP address) and use that
   information to help us analyze how visitors use the site. These vendors
   may use cookies placed on this site (such as the Google Analytics
   cookie) and cookies placed on third-party web sites (such as Google
   advertising cookies), or other third-party identifiers, together, to
   analyze our site visitors.

   You may deactivate the ability of these analytics services to analyze
   your browsing activities on this site. To learn more about web
   analytics service, and to exercise your choice with respect to their
   collection of information on this site:
     * For Adobe Site Catalyst, please click here;
     * To disable Google Analytics, please download the browser add-on for
       the deactivation of Google Analytics provided by Google at
       http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en. To learn more about
       privacy and Google Analytics please consult the Google Analytics
       overview provided by Google at:
       http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html.
     * We may implement certain Google Analytics Advertising Features
       (including Remarketing with Google Analytics; Google Display
       Network Impression Reporting or Google Analytics Demographics and
       Interest Reporting). You can opt-out of the Google Analytics
       Advertising Features through Google Ad settings or by visiting
       https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ We will use the data
       provided by these features as described under “How We Use the
       Information We Collect”

   Targeted Advertising

   We may contract with third-party advertising networks that collect IP
   addresses and other information through the use of cookies, web server
   logs and web beacons on our websites and emails; on third-party
   websites and emails; and on our advertising placed on third-party
   websites. They use this information to provide advertisements about
   products and services tailored to your interests (including for
   companies not affiliated with us). You may see these advertisements on
   third party websites. This process also helps us manage and track the
   effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

   To learn more about interest-based advertising, visit the Digital
   Advertising Alliance at www.aboutads.info/choices. or the Network
   Advertising Initiative at www.networkadvertising.org/choices.

   We may also use third-party platforms, including platforms operated by
   social networks, such as Google, Facebook and Pinterest, to show you
   interest-based ads. We may convert your email address, telephone number
   or other information into a unique value which can be matched by those
   third parties with a user on their platform or with other data they may
   have collected from you. This matching allows interest-based ads to be
   delivered on those platforms. To opt-out of these ads, you must change
   your advertising preferences on those third-party platforms. These
   platforms may have their own privacy notices or policies, which we
   strongly suggest you review.

   How We Use the Information Collected by Automated Means
   We may use the information collected through automated means on this
   site to deliver personalized content, improve our site, and product and
   service offerings, for market research, data analytics and system
   administration purposes, such as to determine whether you’ve visited us
   before or are new to the site, to tailor ads displayed to you on our
   site and elsewhere and for compliance with our legal obligations,
   policies and procedures, including compliance with relevant industry
   standards and the enforcement of our Terms and Conditions . We also may
   use the information in other ways for which specific notice is provided
   at the time of collection.

   Information We Share

   We do not rent lists, or sell or otherwise disclose personal
   information we collect about you, except as described here. We may
   share your personal information with:

       Policy.
     * Third party service providers who perform services on our behalf
       based on our instructions. We do not authorize these service
       providers to use or disclose the information except as necessary to

   financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or
   actual fraudulent or illegal activity.

   We also reserve the right to transfer personal information we have
   about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our
   business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use
   reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information
   you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy
   Policy. Following such a sale or transfer, you may contact the entity
   to which we transferred your personal information with any inquiries
