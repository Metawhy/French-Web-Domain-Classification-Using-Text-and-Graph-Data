#149: What’s Next For Our Master Bathroom Reno

   We’re sharing how our bathroom reno went from zero to fifty percent
   (that’ll make more sense when you hear what we did) and how we gained a
   ton of insight about the right layout and the right size for the
   vanity, shower, tub, etc. Also… the houseplant struggle is real, so we
   asked plant expert Carmeon Hamilton everything we’ve ever wanted to
   know about how to keep inside greenery alive (and happy!). She shared
   her favorite easy plants for beginners and even laid out when to water,
   re-pot, and fertilize your indoor greenery (we were like: wait, we
   should be fertilizing?!?). Plus, we’re shouting out a super handy
   multipurpose tool that we loved so much

4 Low-Tech Ways We’re Planning Our Latest Room Makeover

   We’re in the midst of two room redos right now and I couldn’t be more
   excited about them! One is the master bathroom reno that we shared last
   week, and the other is a much lighter and less dusty one, which
   involves zero demo or wall moving, but a whole lot of function that
   we’ll be gaining (plus a wall treatment + wallpaper, which thrills me
   to no end). We’re “reconfiguring” the middle bedroom at our beach
   house, which used to look like this. Yes, it’s a very small room that
   was basically all bed: Having a lighter room redo running in the
   background while we wait for orders like the master bathroom tub &

#148: How We Keep Our Lives & Projects Organized

   People are always asking how we keep our projects and our household
   organized (“do you make lists? use an app?! help me!”) so today we’re
   outlining the three tools that we use every day. Some are digital, some
   are old school, but the most important part is that they help to keep
   us on the same page (sometimes literally) about our projects,
   purchases, and more. We’re also sharing the near completion of a long
   overdue outdoor update that almost sent one of us over the edge… of the
   roof. Also, could it be true that some people don’t have a de facto
   “side of the bed” every night? WHAT?! We have questions. What’s New
   That’s

Our Long Awaited Master Bathroom Reno Begins

   If you listened to this week’s podcast you heard John and I proclaim
   that we’ve moved from the verrrrry long daydreaming and changing our
   minds phase of our master bathroom planning process (which lasted over
   6 years while we renovated most of the other rooms in our house as well
   as the entire beach house & duplex) into the
   finally-being-sure-of-what-we-want-to-get-out-of-it and beginning to
   actively space-plan it phase. For example, after years of going back
   and forth about whether we wanted a separate tub and shower or a
   tub/shower combo, we’re now 100% sold on separate ones (we have that
   setup at the beach house and it’s our favorite bathroom ever). I even
   said on this

#147: Our Summer Of Living In A Smaller House In A Smaller Town

   What happens when you move into a smaller house in a smaller town for
   over two months? That’s what we found out this summer when we stayed at
   our beach house to manage the duplex rentals – AND IT WAS THE BEST
   SUMMER OF OUR LIVES. The smaller home and smaller town lessons that we
   learned really stuck with us when we returned home – and they have
   already inspired us to make 4 changes to our life and habits back in
   Richmond. So even if you aren’t planning to move or downsize, there are
   some things you could experiment with too. We’re also sharing why we’re
   fiiiiiinally starting a long-awaited renovation in our house,

5 Lessons From Our First Summer As Airbnb Hosts

   We talked on this week’s podcast about how our first rental season at
   the duplex wasn’t perfect, but it went pretty darn smoothly, all things
   considered (you can hear a bunch of specific stories, nerve-wracking
   moments, and things we learned in that episode). Over the course of
   this past summer, we hosted 23 families thanks to it being a duplex.
   Two bookings were always happening simultaneously, and the house was
   fully occupied with guests every night from mid-June to Labor Day. We
   joke that going from managing zero Airbnbs to two was kind of like
   going from having zero kids to having twins – it literally felt like we
   were plunging ourselves into the deep

#146: What It Was Really Like Renting Out The Duplex

   We survived our first summer as Airbnb hosts to 23 different families
   over the course of the last three months – and, more importantly, so
   did the duplex itself! But our first rental season wasn’t without
   hiccups, high anxiety moments, and surprisingly frequent learning
   opportunities. So this week we’re taking you behind the scenes of a
   jam-packed few months of learning the hospitality ropes while juggling
   guests and (more literally) a very full jug of laundry detergent.
   Sherry also celebrates the end of a long “personal renovation” and we
   share how something simple led us to rethink our approach to cooking
   dinner. What’s New I know Sherry’s enduring Invisalign saga has been

A Big Kitchen Makeover Created From Little Changes

   Halcyon Green Blue Kitchen Wall Cabinets With Gold Brass Knobs Above
   Stove

   I’ve been so excited to show you Teresa and Andrew’s kitchen makeover.
   They’re some of our closest friends who live right around the corner
   from us, and ever since we filmed this bookcase styling time-lapse
   video in their living room, I’ve been not-so-patiently waiting for
   their new appliances to arrive so we could share a big ol’ virtual
   kitchen tour with you guys. Not only do they have amazing style, they
   also made SO MANY budget-friendly choices in this kitchen and I really
   hope they help to demonstrate that you can often work with a lot more
   than you might think (you don’t always have to scrap everything and
   start over!). And you can save

Hunting Down The Real History Of The Pink House (There’s A Twist!)

   This all started because we wanted one of those cool “Historic
   District” plaques on our beach house. Spoiler, we got it…and one for
   the duplex too! But the process turned us into amateur sleuths,
   history-buffs-in-training, and (more predictably) people who paint
   their front door a new color while they’re at it. So here’s the story,
   along with a mini porch update, and some concrete tips & advice for
   uncovering the history of your home too. Ever since we bought our beach
   house three years ago (yes, three!) we’ve been jealous of admired the
   official “Cape Charles Historic District” plaque on our neighbor’s
   house (the blue one between the duplex and the pink house in the

Installing A $31 Paneled Wall Treatment (Beginners Can Do This!)

   Many moons ago we promised to share the DIY play by play for this wall
   treatment, because it’s ridiculously easy and GLORIOUSLY BUDGET
   CONSCIOUS. As in, it cost less than two boxes of my favorite light
   bulbs. Or dinner at Chipotle. Yes, those are my units of measure. I
   mentioned in our backsplash post a while back that we opted for a
   different treatment on the stove wall in each of the duplex kitchens
   because it felt too chaotic to continue our patterned tile on two
   walls, so we chose something subtle yet wipeable AND easy to maintain
   (you can see the both duplex kitchen reveals here). Also cheap & easy
   to do. Because at this point

How We Organized Our Beach House Shed (& Two Tips That Helped A Ton)

   Earlier this summer we shared how we made over our beach house backyard
   in one giant post that covered the entire year-long process of taking
   it from a gnarly jungle to compact-yet-relaxing little oasis. It’s a
   very small space, so we worked really hard to squeeze lots of function
   out of it – more on that here – and back when we shared that post, many
   of you asked for photos of the inside of our pink shed along with
   details about what we store there. So today all of your
   shed-poking-around dreams are about to come true. When we shared that
   backyard before & after fest, I confessed that the inside of the shed

Our DIY “Stained Glass” Window (That Hangs On The Wall)

   Color DIY Stained Glass Window Hanging Beyond Beach House Kitchen
   Island

   We had a totally different post planned for today, but then a super
   fun/random project fell into our laps on Monday night. We weren’t sure
   how things would turn out (we were kinda making up a DIY technique as
   we went along), but to say that we’re pleasantly surprised is a giant
   understatement. This might be my favorite under $10 project in the
   history of my life. And it could easily be repeated with any window you
   find at a thrift store, architectural salvage shop, or even at your
   local Habitat for Humanity ReStore. SAVE ALL THE GORGEOUS OLD WINDOWS,
   GUYS! Or you could just wander the streets hoping to be in the right
   place
