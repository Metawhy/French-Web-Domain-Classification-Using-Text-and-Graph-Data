TQC 2017

   The Conference on the Theory of Quantum Computation, Communication and
   Cryptography, will be held in Paris on 14-16 June 2017.
   This is the twelfth in a series of conferences that aims to bring
   together the leading researchers in the areas of quantum computation,
   quantum communication and quantum cryptography. TQC covers all
   theoretical aspects of quantum information and submissions on these
   topics are solicited.

   Areas of interest include, but are not restricted to:
     * quantum algorithms
     * models of quantum computation
     * quantum complexity theory
     * simulation of quantum systems
     * quantum cryptography
     * quantum communication
     * quantum information theory
     * quantum estimation and measurement
     * intersection of quantum information and condensed-matter theory
     * quantum coding theory
     * fault-tolerant quantum computing
     * entanglement theory
    Important dates

     * Paper/Talk/Early-Poster submission deadline: March 10, 2017
     * Decision notification: April 14, 2017
     * Final manuscript deadline: April 28, 2017
     * Late-Poster submission deadline: May 8, 2017
     * Conference: June 14-16, 2017
     * Early bird registration deadline: June 5, 2017

Conference dinner

   There will be an optional conference banquet on a boat along the Seine
   with the additional fees.
     * Regular conference dinner fee: 50 Euros
     * Discounted student conference dinner fee: 25 Euro

Conference fees

   Registrations are now closed.
     * Regular fee: 210 Euros (260 Euros after June 5)
     * Discounted student fee: 125 Euros (175 Euros after June 5)

   Space is limited, so please book early to avoid disappointment.
   Early bird registration finishes 5th June, after which the fees are
   higher as indicated above. For cancellations before June 5th, 2017 we
   will refund the registration fee up to a 50 Euros cancellation charge.
   On or after June 5th, 2017 refunds will no longer be possible.
   There is a limited amount of support for students, young researchers
   and those in need of child care. Please contact Sorry, you need
   Javascript on to email me. if you would like to request support stating
   your situation and reasons.

Satellite workshop

   There will be a satellite workshop on Trustworthy Quantum Information
   (TYQI 2017) 19th - 21st June. Click here for information.

Conference tracks

   Two tracks: Conference(talk + proceedings) and Workshop(talk only). As
   the goal of TQC is to bring together researchers on all aspects of
   quantum information, submissions are solicited for two tracks:
     * Conference(talk + proceedings): Submissions to this track must be
       original papers that have not previously appeared in published
       form. Accepted papers will be presented orally at the conference
       and will appear in the conference proceedings. The proceedings will
       be published by the OpenAccess LIPIcs (Leibniz International
       Proceedings in Informatics).
     * Workshop(talk only): We solicit submissions for talk-only papers;
       accepted submissions will be presented orally at the conference but
       will not appear in the proceedings. This track allows authors to
       publish their work elsewhere and accepts already published
       material.
