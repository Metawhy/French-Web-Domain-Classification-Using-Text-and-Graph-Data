Emily Mitchell

   Customer Experience Manager The Perfume Shop company logo

   "DigitalGenius powered a drop in our first-response time (FRT) to an
   all-time low. 40% of responses from our contact center are now answered
   in part or in whole by DigitalGenius, and we’ve seen notable
   improvements in customer satisfaction and AHT as a result. It’s
   allowing our agents to invest more of their time into solving complex
   customer queries instead. This is a big win for us and for our
   customers."

Maria Muniz

   Head of Customer Support Course Hero company logo

   "We chose DigitalGenius because we were excited about their ability to
   fully automate our most repetitive customer inquiry. Today
   DigitalGenius' AI platform is already handling 33% of all inbound
   customer service tickets, and over half of those are now fully resolved
   with zero agent involvement. It's allowing our agents to shift to a
   more proactive orientation. We love these results."

Philipp Theißler

   Head of Customer Happiness Runtastic company logo

   "DigitalGenius doesn't merely help our support team to respond faster.
   When we receive customer queries that are difficult even for our
   trained support agents to understand, DigitalGenius comes to the rescue
   by rapidly determining the customer intent, then by prompting our
   agents with the right answers. We're very impressed with this
   platform."

Pieter Groeneveld

   Senior Vice President of Digital KLM Royal Dutch Airlines company logo

   "By using artificial intelligence, KLM makes conversations with our
   customers even more timely, correct, and personal. This is what
   characterizes KLM. With the use of AI we support our service agents
   with technology and should be able to answer many more questions in a
   shorter period of time. This is exactly what the customer needs."

Briana Cahn

   Student Help Manager Magoosh company logo

   "In our first full week live with DigitalGenius' AutoPilot, it was
   already auto-resolving close to 10% of my team's ticket volume. We're
   now putting additional tickets on autopilot, and we expect to
   auto-resolve between 15-20% of my team's volume soon."

James Lemire

   Director of Customer Care Soylent company logo

   "We chose DigitalGenius because they were able to begin email
   automation shortly after integrating, in addition to immediately
   equipping agents with time-saving macro suggestions. The time saved has
   enabled us to work more closely with our agents to further refine their
   skills and learn about their needs. The result is efficient, quality
   service and higher agent morale."

Joel Beach

   Director of Customer Care Imagine Learning company logo

   “DigitalGenius not only improved the response time in our contact
   center, with customer responses now 70% faster than they were without
   AI, they also expanded the capacity of my team to focus on more
   difficult tasks, and not repetitive tickets. We actually didn’t have to
   hire new team members for this entire past year. Since we implemented
   DigitalGenius, their team has also been extremely knowledgeable and
   easy to work with”

Maryvonne Hassell

   IT Strategy Manager AVDC

   "The best thing about DigitalGenius is that the AI is continuously
   improving. As it develops every day, AVDC is now looking at ways of
   automating even further, broadening the range of questions that we can
   answer so as to enhance our customers’ everyday experience. We can
   almost directly correlate DigitalGenius technology with our people
   management, allowing us the flexibility to move people around the
   organization and to use their time in a more productive
   customer-focused way."

Want to Learn More About DigitalGenius?

Here are a few answers to help you learn more about how to start
understanding conversations, automating repetitive processes and delighting
your customers.

[faqarrow.png]

   How do I use DigitalGenius inside my customer support operation?

   DigitalGenius is installed as an app into your existing customer
   service software (Salesforce, Zendesk and others). We will take you
   through a seamless onboarding experience that identifies your most
   expensive & repetitive tickets; connects your CRM to our AI platform;
   then trains and deploys your first AI model.
   Once DigitalGenius is configured and the model is trained, you can
   onboard your agents, and begin automating inbound queries end-to-end;
   assist agents to handle tickets faster, therefore reducing AHT; support
   increasing volumes, and open up new communication channels like
   Facebook Messenger, Live Chat and SMS.

[faqarrow.png]

   What processes does DigitalGenius automate?

   1. DigitalGenius puts your most repetitive and expensive tickets on
   autopilot by connecting conversations to processes; from the inbound
   ticket all the way through your backend systems via our open API
   framework.
   2. Together we map out the automation framework, custom-building
   exactly how you want your repetitive tickets to be resolved, and what
   information you’d like included in order to best reply to your
   customers. 3. DigitalGenius’ AI recognizes the objective of a
   customer’s question. When the answer rises above a certain confidence
   level, those processes can be automated. When it’s below, your agents
   will pick up those tickets, which ensures a consistent and accurate
   customer experience. 4. To provide the greatest ROI, we aim to automate
   the tickets that are the most repetitive, expensive and time-consuming
   for your business. These can be anything from refunds, account lookups,
   order cancellations, shipping status and so on. You tell us what they
   are - we'll do the rest.

[faqarrow.png]

   How do I know if my company is a good fit for AI and Customer Service
   Automation?

   Adding a layer of AI into your customer support operations is a
   journey, but it’s not for everyone. While DigitalGenius supports a wide
   variety of use cases, we want to make sure there is a good fit for your
   business, your agents and your customers.
   If your customer service team has a large amount of inbound, text-based
   tickets; if you have 10 agents or more; AND if you’re experiencing
   repetitive queries and processes - chances are that DigitalGenius can
   not only reduce your costs, but will also help make customer service a
   competitive advantage for your business.

[faqarrow.png]

   Let us do the heavy lifting! We want to learn about you, the challenges
   you’re facing in customer service, and then determine if we’re the
   right choice for your business. Give us 30 minutes, and we can
   definitely answer the question.
   If we uncover that there’s a mutual fit, we'll take you through a
   deeper review of our product, validate an AI match and provide you with
   a roadmap of what it will take to go live, plus pricing, an
   implementation plan and a full ROI calculation. Want to come on an
   AI-powered automation journey with us? Let's talk. Get started by
