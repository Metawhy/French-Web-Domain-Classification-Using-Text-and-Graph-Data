About

   BA, Dartmouth College; PhD, University at Albany (SUNY); Postdocs:
   Duke, Univ. Minnesota, Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute. UMBC
   Faculty 2000 - present. Australian National University 2007, 2010. UMBC
   Presidential Research Professor 2016-2019.

Research Interests

   Evolutionary Biology - Molecular phylogeny and population genetics of
   closely related birds to study speciation and character evolution.
   Recent research has focused on the orioles (genus Icterus), as well as
   ravens (genus Corvus). Current project on the conservation biology of
   the critically endangered Bahama Oriole.
   http://www.birdscaribbean.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Omland-Bahama-
   Oriole-NAOCposter2016.pdf

Teaching Interests

   Introductory biology, diversity, evolution, phylogeny, population
   genetics, animal behavior, conservation. Especially interested in
   teaching clear tree thinking as there is no "ladder of progress" in
   evolution.
