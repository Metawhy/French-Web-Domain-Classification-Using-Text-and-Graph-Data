   INTRODUCING VAST HORIZON

   Vast Horizon embraces the spirit of romance with the whimsical-chic
   style of the 1970’s, and two bold colour choices. The collection is
   both playful and classy; with easy laid-back styles, pleated hem
   frills, tassel ties and beautiful boarder trims. The relaxed fits will
   keep you swishing and swaying with every move.


   We are feeling oh so romantic here at Arnhem, as we open our hearts to
   the magic and possibilities of a Vast Horizon. Style yourself for
   blissful sunny days that turn into mystical nights. Flirty and
   hypnotic, it’s for bohemian goddesses ready to dance, dream & soak up
   the adventure.

   Before you get totally lost in the land of love of magic skies, take a
   snap, and share the love on instagram by tagging @arnhem_clothing.

MOVING FORWARD………

   It’s been said that a brand’s clothing line is a true visual
   personification of the brand

   itself, and that could not ring anymore true for Arnhem Clothing.

   Born into a gypsy lifestyle of colour and beauty, Arnhem Bickley had a
   unique

   childhood that set her into her personal and professional world with an

   understanding for the importance of nature.

   Arnhem and her family lived completely off the grid for the first 15
   years of her life.

   FullSizeRender IMG_2785 IMG_2765 IMG_2789 This left Arnhem inspired
   with a heightened sense of creativity, a great deal of

   environmental ethics and a strong connection and bond with nature and
   our land.

   This way of life emerged at a young age. She began sewing clothing for
   her dolls at

   the age of four, which sparked her passion for design. Arnhem has been
   conscious

   from day one of the impacts on the environment and the sustainability
   of having a

   clothing label, holding high standards of ethical production.

   IMG_2030 copy

   Grounded in Byron Bay with her two beautiful girls and partner her
   designs are still

   heavily influenced by the wilderness and the beauty of her home in
   Byron Bay.

   Arnhem does not for a second take her surroundings of nature and beauty
   for

   granted and this can be seen through the business’ current procedures
   and future

   plans for an even more sustainable practice in the fashion world.

   Arnhem’s bohemian spirit flows into every piece of Arnhem Clothing,
   designed in

   Byron Bay Australia.

   Byron-Bay

   The Factories We use are Family owned and run businesses with employees
   on board that have worked for over 15 years. Some of the employees have
   the option to work from home if they have children to care for and all
   employees still enjoy social and tradtional activities.

   All our left over fabrics are made into garments and donated to the
   nursing homes and orphanages.

   Arnhem has sourced these factories her self and worked with these
   factories for 12 years and they have grown

   together.

   The factories are of high standards with air con, well paid and happy

   employees and correct recycling systems in place for waste with
   printing houses.

   print 20160603143950 fact old3

   Our designs are well thought out. We design each piece taking

   environmental

   impacts into consideration during the production and manufacturing
   process. This is

   known as eco-design. Eco-design not only improves the environmental
   outcomes it

   also reduces our costs long-term, win-win!

   We reduce our ecological footprint by making some of our garments
   multifunctional:

   encouraging customers to do more with less through multifunctional
   design promotes

   overall environmental benefits. We try to design the garments so they
   have timeless

   style. Some of Arnhem’s pieces from her Byron Bay market days still are
   loved and

   asked about frequently.

   Don’t be surprised if you find a beautiful Arnhem piece in a Salvation
   Army,

   Life Line or St.Vincent charity store, as we often donate our seconds
   and samples.

   old old 4

   At Arnhem our garments come in Biodegradable packaging

   IMG_9697

   and we are

   currently looking into using compostable plastics for our post it
   satchels.

   All our printing paper, Bags and swing tags are made from 100% recycled
   paper and

   IMG_9691 IMG_9702

    Moving forward on our materials this year, we are excited to announce
   that we will

   be launching our first hemp range and we are researching sustainable
   sourced

   materials fibres for our Rayon and Cottons such as Linen, Kenaf, Banana
   Fibre, and Bamboo.

   fabric-sourcing7 48725_3

    At Arnhem we believe strongly in renewable energy.

   Arnhem and Ryan have already joined the solar energy movement at her
   home with a 5.2 watt Solar set up on their roof,

   and we are installing a 25 Watt solar

   panel system on our warehouse in October this year.

   IMG_2649 (1) IMG_2636 copy ecoSolargy-1

    Arnhem is a supporter and share holder in Enova energy, the first
   community owned

   energy company that provides 100% renewable energy to the local
   community.

   Screen Shot 2016-06-06 at 11.32.43 am

   Arnhem also feels that it is very important to have some part in
   reducing carbon

   emission produced from importing our products via air or sea. So we are
   proud

   supporters and donators of green fleet a non profit organisation
   dedicated to

   encouraging organisations and individuals to avoid and reduce
   greenhouse gas.

   Screen Shot 2016-06-06 at 11.30.24 am

   At Arnhem we are very transparent in our workings and proud of our
   movements and

   future plans for an even more sustainable business. This is exciting
   for us and

   something that all fashion and clothing manufacturing should be taking
   on board. We

   encourage everyone to jump on board this movement with us and help us
   all work

   towards a more sustainable future reducing one ecological footprint at
   a time!

Lazy Days and Sunny Rays


   We spent the day with sweetheart Hannah Busuttil in her beautiful house
   in the Byron Hinterland. With a big huge sunshine soaked deck, there
   was no better place to start the day looking out over her the hills and
   admiring her blossoming vege patch.

LOVIN’ LUCETTE

   Lucette Romy is a jet setting gypsy with huge ambition and travel
   goals! Back briefly from an Indonesian adventure, we grabbed her to
   spend the day frolicking around south of Byron visiting Trevs exotic
   bird and plant paradise. We sipped on smoothies and chatted a lot with
   the Lennox Locals, and also checked out the iconic house of windmills
   and letterboxes.

   We fell in love with this babe, she is beautiful inside and out, with a
   heart of gold, she cares a lot about the environment and her health. We
   were lucky to hang with Lucette, her suitcase is already packed, and it
   won’t be too long before she is off on another adventure.

A PLACE TO CALL HOME

   You would be hard pressed to find a more rewarding feeling than that of
   turning your house into a home.

   But what makes a home? Is it the overpriced cushions placed
   strategically on your lounge, coffee table books perched in their
   respective positions, or perhaps it is the indoor plants inspired by
   endless nights scrolling through Pinterest boards.

   Over time, you may begin to imagine the difference of a new throw added
   to your living space and the life changing impact of a new baby blue
   toaster on your kitchen bench top, would make. So we have decided to
   keep inspired and celebrate newness by sharing a selection of our
   favourite spaces.
