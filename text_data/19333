National Report on Large Whale Entanglements (2017)

   November 06, 2018

   This report provides a summary of large whale entanglements that
   occurred in U.S. waters in 2017 including species, locations, and an
   overview of response efforts.

   Document |
   National

   Seventy-six confirmed cases of large whale entanglements were
   documented along the coasts of the United States in 2017. Seventy of
   these entanglement cases involved live animals and six involved dead
   animals. All were independently confirmed by the Large Whale
   Entanglement Response Network.

   The five most frequently entangled large whale species in 2017 included
   humpback whale, gray whale, minke whale, blue whale, and North Atlantic
   right whale. Large whale entanglements were reported and confirmed in
   the waters of 13 states, along all U.S. coasts except within the Gulf
   of Mexico.

   Approximately 70 percent of confirmed cases in 2017 were entangled in
   fishing gear (line and buoys, traps, monofilament line, and nets).

Introduction

Section 2. Findings and Declaration of Policy

16 U.S.C. 1361

   The Congress finds that—

   (1) certain species and population stocks of marine mammals are, or may
   be, in danger of extinction or depletion as a result of man's
   activities;

   (2) such species and population stocks should not be permitted to
   diminish beyond the point at which they cease to be a significant
   functioning element in the ecosystem of which they are a part, and,
   consistent with this major objective, they should not be permitted to
   diminish below their optimum sustainable population. Further measures
   should be immediately taken to replenish any species or population
   stock which has already diminished below that population. In
   particular, efforts should be made to protect essential habitats,
   including the rookeries, mating grounds, and areas of similar
   significance for each species of marine mammal from the adverse effect
   of man's actions;

   (3) there is inadequate knowledge of the ecology and population
   dynamics of such marine mammals and of the factors which bear upon
   their ability to reproduce themselves successfully;

   (4) negotiations should be undertaken immediately to encourage the
   development of international arrangements for research on, and
   conservation of, all marine mammals;

   (5) marine mammals and marine mammal products either—

     (A) move in interstate commerce, or
     (B) affect the balance of marine ecosystems in a manner which is
     important to other animals and animal products which move in
     interstate commerce, and that the protection and conservation of
     marine mammals and their habitats is therefore necessary to insure
     the continuing availability of those products which move in
     interstate commerce; and

   (6) marine mammals have proven themselves to be resources of great
   international significance, esthetic and recreational as well as
   economic, and it is the sense of the Congress that they should be
   protected and encouraged to develop to the greatest extent feasible
   commensurate with sound policies of resource management and that the
   primary objective of their management should be to maintain the health
   and stability of the marine ecosystem. Whenever consistent with this
   primary objective, it should be the goal to obtain an optimum
   sustainable population keeping in mind the carrying capacity of the
   habitat.

Section 4. Effective Date

   Sec. 4.

   The provisions of this Act shall take effect upon the expiration of the
   sixty day period following the date of its enactment.

Title I - Conservation and Protection of Marine Mammals

Section 101. Moratorium on taking and importing marine mammals and marine
mammal products

16 U.S.C. 1371 Sec. 101.

   (a) Imposition; exceptions There shall be a moratorium on the taking
   and importation of marine mammals and marine mammal products,
   commencing on the effective date of this chapter, during which time no
   permit may be issued for the taking of any marine mammal and no marine
   mammal or marine mammal product may be imported into the United States
   except in the following cases:

     (1) Consistent with the provisions of section 1374 of this title,
     permits may be issued by the Secretary for taking, and importation
     for purposes of scientific research, public display, photography for
     educational or commercial purposes, or enhancing the survival or
     recovery of a species or stock, or for importation of polar bear
     parts (other than internal organs) taken in sport hunts in Canada.
     Such permits, except permits issued under section 1374 (c)(5) of
     this title, may be issued if the taking or importation proposed to
     be made is first reviewed by the Marine Mammal Commission and the
     Committee of Scientific Advisors on Marine Mammals established under
     subchapter III of this chapter. The Commission and Committee shall
     recommend any proposed taking or importation, other than importation
     under section 1374 (c)(5) of this title, which is consistent with
     the purposes and policies of section 1361 of this title. If the
     Secretary issues such a permit for importation, the Secretary shall
     issue to the importer concerned a certificate to that effect in such
     form as the Secretary of the Treasury prescribes, and such
     importation may be made upon presentation of the certificate to the
     customs officer concerned.

     (2) Marine mammals may be taken incidentally in the course of
     commercial fishing operations and permits may be issued therefor
     under section 1374 of this title subject to regulations prescribed
     by the Secretary in accordance with section 1373 of this title, or
     in lieu of such permits, authorizations may be granted therefor
     under section 1387 of this title, subject to regulations prescribed
     under that section by the Secretary without regard to section 1373
     of this title. Such authorizations may be granted under subchapter
     IV of this chapter with respect to purse seine fishing for yellowfin
     tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, subject to regulations
     prescribed under that subchapter by the Secretary without regard to
     section 1373 of this title. In any event it shall be the immediate
     goal that the incidental kill or incidental serious injury of marine
     mammals permitted in the course of commercial fishing operations be
     reduced to insignificant levels approaching a zero mortality and
     serious injury rate. The Secretary of the Treasury shall ban the
     importation of commercial fish or products from fish which have been
     caught with commercial fishing technology which results in the
     incidental kill or incidental serious injury of ocean mammals in
     excess of United States standards. For purposes of applying the
     preceding sentence, the Secretary—

     (A) shall insist on reasonable proof from the government of any
     nation from which fish or fish products will be exported to the
     United States of the effects on ocean mammals of the commercial
     fishing technology in use for such fish or fish products exported
     from such nation to the United States;

     (B) in the case of yellowfin tuna harvested with purse seine nets in
     the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, and products therefrom, to be
     exported to the United States, shall require that the government of
     the exporting nation provide documentary evidence that—

     (i)

     (I) the tuna or products therefrom were not banned from importation
     under this paragraph before the effective date of section 4 of the
     International Dolphin Conservation Program Act; or

     (II) the tuna or products therefrom were harvested after the
     effective date of section 4 of the International Dolphin
     Conservation Program Act by vessels of a nation which participates
     in the International Dolphin Conservation Program, and such
     harvesting nation is either a member of the Inter-American Tropical
     Tuna Commission or has initiated (and within 6 months thereafter
     completed) all steps required of applicant nations, in accordance
     with article V, paragraph 3 of the Convention establishing the
     Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, to become a member of that
     organization;

     (ii) such nation is meeting the obligations of the International
     Dolphin Conservation Program and the obligations of membership in
     the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, including all financial
     obligations; and

     (iii) the total dolphin mortality limits, and per-stock per-year
     dolphin mortality limits permitted for that nation’s vessels under
     the International Dolphin Conservation Program do not exceed the
     limits determined for 1997, or for any year thereafter, consistent
     with the objective of progressively reducing dolphin mortality to a
     level approaching zero through the setting of annual limits and the
     goal of eliminating dolphin mortality, and requirements of the
     International Dolphin Conservation Program;

     (C) shall not accept such documentary evidence if—

     (i) the government of the harvesting nation does not provide
     directly or authorize the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission to
     release complete and accurate information to the Secretary in a
     timely manner—

     (I) to allow determination of compliance with the International
     Dolphin Conservation Program; and

     (II) for the purposes of tracking and verifying compliance with the
     minimum requirements established by the Secretary in regulations
     promulgated under section 1385 (f) of this title; or

     (ii) after taking into consideration such information, findings of
     the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, and any other relevant
     information, including information that a nation is consistently
     failing to take enforcement actions on violations which diminish the
     effectiveness of the International Dolphin Conservation Program, the
     Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State, finds that
     the harvesting nation is not in compliance with the International
     Dolphin Conservation Program.

     (D) shall require the government of any intermediary nation to
     certify and provide reasonable proof to the Secretary that it has
     not imported, within the preceding six months, any yellowfin tuna or
     yellowfin tuna products that are subject to a direct ban on
     importation to the United States under subparagraph (B);

     (E) shall, six months after importation of yellowfin tuna or tuna
     products has been banned under this section, certify such fact to
     the President, which certification shall be deemed to be a
     certification for the purposes of section 1978 (a) of title 22 for
     as long as such ban is in effect; and

     (F)

     (i) except as provided in clause (ii), in the case of fish or
     products containing fish harvested by a nation whose fishing vessels
     engage in high seas driftnet fishing, shall require that the
     government of the exporting nation provide documentary evidence that
     the fish or fish product was not harvested with a large-scale
     driftnet in the South Pacific Ocean after July 1, 1991, or in any
     other water of the high seas after January 1, 1993, and

     (ii) in the case of tuna or a product containing tuna harvested by a
     nation whose fishing vessels engage in high seas driftnet fishing,
     shall require that the government of the exporting nation provide
     documentary evidence that the tuna or tuna product was not harvested
     with a large-scale driftnet anywhere on the high seas after July 1,
     1991. For purposes of subparagraph (F), the term "driftnet" has the
     meaning given such term in section 4003 of the Driftnet Impact
     Monitoring, Assessment, and Control Act of 1987 (16 U.S.C. 1822
     note), except that, until January 1, 1994, the term "driftnet" does
     not include the use in the northeast Atlantic Ocean of gillnets with
     a total length not to exceed five kilometers if the use is in
     accordance with regulations adopted by the European Community
     pursuant to the October 28, 1991, decision by the Council of
     Fisheries Ministers of the Community.

     (3)

     (A) The Secretary, on the basis of the best scientific evidence
     available and in consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission, is
     authorized and directed, from time to time, having due regard to the
     distribution, abundance, breeding habits, and times and lines of
     migratory movements of such marine mammals, to determine when, to
     what extent, if at all, and by what means, it is compatible with
     this chapter to waive the requirements of this section so as to
     allow taking, or importing of any marine mammal, or any marine
     mammal product, and to adopt suitable regulations, issue permits,
     and make determinations in accordance with sections 1372, 1373,
     1374, and 1381 of this title permitting and governing such taking
     and importing, in accordance with such determinations: Provided,
     however, That the Secretary, in making such determinations must be
     assured that the taking of such marine mammal is in accord with
     sound principles of resource protection and conservation as provided
     in the purposes and policies of this chapter: Provided, further,
     however, That no marine mammal or no marine mammal product may be
     imported into the United States unless the Secretary certifies that
     the program for taking marine mammals in the country of origin is
     consistent with the provisions and policies of this chapter.
     Products of nations not so certified may not be imported into the
     United States for any purpose, including processing for exportation.

     (B) Except for scientific research purposes, photography for
     educational or commercial purposes, or enhancing the survival or
     recovery of a species or stock as provided for in paragraph (1) of
     this subsection, or as provided for under paragraph (5) of this
     subsection, during the moratorium no permit may be issued for the
     taking of any marine mammal which has been designated by the
     Secretary as depleted, and no importation may be made of any such
     mammal.

     (4)

     (A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), the provisions
     of this chapter shall not apply to the use of measures—

     (i) by the owner of fishing gear or catch, or an employee or agent
     of such owner, to deter a marine mammal from damaging the gear or
     catch;

     (ii) by the owner of other private property, or an agent, bailee, or
     employee of such owner, to deter a marine mammal from damaging
     private property;

     (iii) by any person, to deter a marine mammal from endangering
     personal safety; or

     (iv) by a government employee, to deter a marine mammal from
     damaging public property,

     so long as such measures do not result in the death or serious
     injury of a marine mammal.

     (B) The Secretary shall, through consultation with appropriate
     experts, and after notice and opportunity for public comment,
     publish in the Federal Register a list of guidelines for use in
     safely deterring marine mammals. In the case of marine mammals
     listed as endangered species or threatened species under the
     Endangered Species Act of 1973 [16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.], the
     Secretary shall recommend specific measures which may be used to
     nonlethally deter marine mammals. Actions to deter marine mammals
     consistent with such guidelines or specific measures shall not be a
     violation of this chapter.

     (C) If the Secretary determines, using the best scientific
     information available, that certain forms of deterrence have a
     significant adverse effect on marine mammals, the Secretary may
     prohibit such deterrent methods, after notice and opportunity for
     public comment, through regulation under this chapter.

     (D) The authority to deter marine mammals pursuant to subparagraph
     (A) applies to all marine mammals, including all stocks designated
     as depleted under this chapter.

     (5)

     (A)

     (i) Except as provided by clause (ii), upon request therefor by
     citizens of the United States who engage in a specified activity
     (other than commercial fishing) within a specified geographical
     region, the Secretary shall allow, during periods of not more than
     five consecutive years each, the incidental, but not intentional,
     taking by citizens while engaging in that activity within that
     region of small numbers of marine mammals of a species or population
     stock if the Secretary, after notice (in the Federal Register and in
     newspapers of general circulation, and through appropriate
     electronic media, in the coastal areas that may be affected by such
     activity) and opportunity for public comment—

     (I) finds that the total of such taking during each five-year (or
     less) period concerned will have a negligible impact on such species
     or stock and will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the
     availability of such species or stock for taking for subsistence
     uses pursuant to subsection (b) of this section or section 1379 (f)
     of this title or, in the case of a cooperative agreement under both
     this chapter and the Whaling Convention Act of 1949 (16 U.S.C. 916
     et seq.), pursuant to section 1382 (c) of this title; and

     (II) prescribes regulations setting forth—

     (aa) permissible methods of taking pursuant to such activity, and
     other means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on
     such species or stock and its habitat, paying particular attention
     to rookeries, mating grounds, and areas of similar significance, and
     on the availability of such species or stock for subsistence uses;
     and

     (bb) requirements pertaining to the monitoring and reporting of such
     taking.

     (ii) In the case of a military readiness activity (as defined in
     section 315(f) of the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act
     for Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-314; 16 U.S.C. 703 note)),
     clause (i) shall be applied –

     (I) in the matter preceding clause (I), by substituting ‘seven
     consecutive years’ for ‘five consecutive years’; and

     (II) in clause (I), by substituting ‘seven-year’ for ‘five-year’.

     (iii) For a military readiness activity (as defined in section
     315(f) of Public Law 107–314; 16 U.S.C. 703 note), a determination
     of "least practicable adverse impact on such species or stock" under
     clause (i)(II)(aa) shall include consideration of personnel safety,
     practicality of implementation, and impact on the effectiveness of
     the military readiness activity. Before making the required
     determination, the Secretary shall consult with the Department of
     Defense regarding personnel safety, practicality of implementation,
     and impact on the effectiveness of the military readiness activity.

     (iv) Notwithstanding clause (i), for any authorization affecting a
     military readiness activity (as defined in section 315(f) of Public
     Law 107–314; 16 U. S.C. 703 note), the Secretary shall publish the
     notice required by such clause only in the Federal Register.

     (B) The Secretary shall withdraw, or suspend for a time certain
     (either on an individual or class basis, as appropriate) the
     permission to take marine mammals under subparagraph (A) pursuant to
     a specified activity within a specified geographical region if the
     Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for public comment (as
     required under subparagraph (A) unless subparagraph (C)(i) applies),
     that—

     (i) the regulations prescribed under subparagraph (A) regarding
     methods of taking, monitoring, or reporting are not being
     substantially complied with by a person engaging in such activity;
     or

     (ii) the taking allowed under subparagraph (A) pursuant to one or
     more activities within one or more regions is having, or may have,
     more than a negligible impact on the species or stock concerned.

     (C)

     (i) The requirement for notice and opportunity for public comment in
     subparagraph (B) shall not apply in the case of a suspension of
     permission to take if the Secretary determines that an emergency
     exists which poses a significant risk to the well-being of the
     species or stock concerned.

     (ii) Sections 1373 and 1374 of this title shall not apply to the
     taking of marine mammals under the authority of this paragraph.

     (D)

     (i) Upon request therefor by citizens of the United States who
     engage in a specified activity (other than commercial fishing)
     within a specific geographic region, the Secretary shall authorize,
     for periods of not more than 1 year, subject to such conditions as
     the Secretary may specify, the incidental, but not intentional,
     taking by harassment of small numbers of marine mammals of a species
     or population stock by such citizens while engaging in that activity
     within that region if the Secretary finds that such harassment
     during each period concerned—

     (I) will have a negligible impact on such species or stock, and

     (II) will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability
     of such species or stock for taking for subsistence uses pursuant to
     subsection (b) of this section, or section 1379 (f) of this title or
     pursuant to a cooperative agreement under section 1388 of this
     title.

     (ii) The authorization for such activity shall prescribe, where
     applicable—

     (I) permissible methods of taking by harassment pursuant to such
     activity, and other means of effecting the least practicable impact
     on such species or stock and its habitat, paying particular
     attention to rookeries, mating grounds, and areas of similar
     significance, and on the availability of such species or stock for
     taking for subsistence uses pursuant to subsection (b) of this
     section or section 1379 (f) of this title or pursuant to a
     cooperative agreement under section 1388 of this title,

     (II) the measures that the Secretary determines are necessary to
     ensure no unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of the
     species or stock for taking for subsistence uses pursuant to
     subsection (b) of this section or section 1379 (f) of this title or
     pursuant to a cooperative agreement under section 1388 of this
     title, and

     (III) requirements pertaining to the monitoring and reporting of
     such taking by harassment, including requirements for the
     independent peer review of proposed monitoring plans or other
     research proposals where the proposed activity may affect the
     availability of a species or stock for taking for subsistence uses
     pursuant to subsection (b) of this section or section 1379 (f) of
     this title or pursuant to a cooperative agreement under section 1388
     of this title.

     (iii) The Secretary shall publish a proposed authorization not later

     been granted under this subparagraph shall not be subject to the
     penalties of this chapter for taking by harassment that occurs in
     compliance with such authorization.

     (vi) For a military readiness activity (as defined in section 315(f)
     of Public Law 107–314; 16 U.S.C. 703 note), a determination of
     "least practicable adverse impact on such species or stock" under
     clause (i)(I) shall include consideration of personnel safety,
     practicality of implementation, and impact on the effectiveness of
     the military readiness activity. Before making the required
     determination, the Secretary shall consult with the Department of
     Defense regarding personnel safety, practicality of implementation,
     and impact on the effectiveness of the military readiness activity.

     (vii) Notwithstanding clause (iii), for any authorization affecting
     a military readiness activity (as defined in section 315(f) of
     Public Law 107–314; 16 U. S.C. 703 note), the Secretary shall

     valid fishing permits issued by the Secretary in accordance with
     section 1824 (b) of this title, while engaging in commercial fishing
     operations, of marine mammals from a species or stock designated as
     depleted because of its listing as an endangered species or
     threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.
     S.C. 1531 et seq.) if the Secretary, after notice and opportunity
     for public comment, determines that—

     (I) the incidental mortality and serious injury from commercial
     fisheries will have a negligible impact on such species or stock;

     (II) a recovery plan has been developed or is being developed for
     such species or stock pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of
     1973; and

     (III) where required under section 1387 of this title, a monitoring
     program is established under subsection (d) of such section, vessels
     engaged in such fisheries are registered in accordance with such
     section, and a take reduction plan has been developed or is being
     developed for such species or stock.

     (ii) Upon a determination by the Secretary that the requirements of
     clause (i) have been met, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal
     Register a list of those fisheries for which such determination was
     made, and, for vessels required to register under section 1387 of
     this title, shall issue an appropriate permit for each authorization
     granted under such section to vessels to which this paragraph
     applies. Vessels engaged in a fishery included in the notice
     published by the Secretary under this clause which are not required
     to register under section 1387 of this title shall not be subject to
     the penalties of this chapter for the incidental taking of marine
     mammals to which this paragraph applies, so long as the owner or
     master of such vessel reports any incidental mortality or injury of
     such marine mammals to the Secretary in accordance with section 1387
     of this title.

     (iii) If, during the course of the commercial fishing season, the
     Secretary determines that the level of incidental mortality or
     serious injury from commercial fisheries for which a determination
     was made under clause (i) has resulted or is likely to result in an
     impact that is more than negligible on the endangered or threatened
     species or stock, the Secretary shall use the emergency authority
     granted under section 1387 of this title to protect such species or
     stock, and may modify any permit granted under this paragraph as
     necessary.

     (iv) The Secretary may suspend for a time certain or revoke a permit
     granted under this subparagraph only if the Secretary determines
     that the conditions or limitations set forth in such permit are not
     being complied with. The Secretary may amend or modify, after notice
     and opportunity for public comment, the list of fisheries published
     under clause (ii) whenever the Secretary determines there has been a
     significant change in the information or conditions used to
     determine such list.

     (v) Sections 1373 and 1374 of this title shall not apply to the
     taking of marine mammals under the authority of this subparagraph.

     (vi) This subparagraph shall not govern the incidental taking of
     California sea otters and shall not be deemed to amend or repeal the
     Act of November 7, 1986 (Public Law 99–625; 100 Stat. 3500).

     (F) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, any
     authorization affecting a military readiness activity (as defined in

     provided that the product is imported into the United States by the
     same person upon the termination of travel;

     (ii) was acquired outside of the United States as part of a cultural
     exchange by an Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo residing in Alaska; or

     (iii) is owned by a Native inhabitant of Russia, Canada, or
     Greenland and is imported for noncommercial purposes in conjunction
     with travel within the United States or as part of a cultural
     exchange with an Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo residing in Alaska.

     (B) For the purposes of this paragraph, the term—

     (i) "Native inhabitant of Russia, Canada, or Greenland" means a
     person residing in Russia, Canada, or Greenland who is related by
     blood, is a member of the same clan or ethnological grouping, or
     shares a common heritage with an Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo residing
     in Alaska; and

     (ii) "cultural exchange" means the sharing or exchange of ideas,
     information, gifts, clothing, or handicrafts between an Indian,
     Aleut, or Eskimo residing in Alaska and a Native inhabitant of

     for establishing such regulations and consistent with the purposes
     of this chapter. Such regulations shall be prescribed after notice
     and hearing required by section 1373 of this title and shall be
     removed as soon as the Secretary determines that the need for their
     imposition has disappeared. In promulgating any regulation or making
     any assessment pursuant to a hearing or proceeding under this
     subsection or section 1386 (b)(2) of this title, or in making any

   The Secretary may seize and dispose of any carcass.

   (d) Good Samaritan exemption It shall not be a violation of this
   chapter to take a marine mammal if—

     (1) such taking is imminently necessary to avoid serious injury,
     additional injury, or death to a marine mammal entangled in fishing
     gear or debris;

     (2) reasonable care is taken to ensure the safe release of the
     marine mammal, taking into consideration the equipment, expertise,
     and conditions at hand;

     (3) reasonable care is exercised to prevent any further injury to
     the marine mammal; and

     (4) such taking is reported to the Secretary within 48 hours.

   (e) Chapter not to apply to incidental takings by United States
   citizens employed on foreign vessels outside United States EEZ The
   provisions of this chapter shall not apply to a citizen of the United
   States who incidentally takes any marine mammal during fishing
   operations outside the United States exclusive economic zone (as

     this subsection for the same action or category of actions, after—

     (i) conferring with the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of the
     Interior, or both as appropriate; and

     (ii) making a new determination that the additional exemption is
     necessary for national defense.

     (B) Each additional exemption under this paragraph shall be
     effective for a period specified by the Secretary of Defense, of not
     more than 2 years.

     (4) Not later than 30 days after issuing an exemption under

     (B) the location and manner (which manner must be determined by the
     Secretary to be humane) in which they may be taken, or from which
     they may be imported,

     (C) the period during which the permit is valid, and

     (D) any other terms or conditions which the Secretary deems
     appropriate. In any case in which an application for a permit cites
     as a reason for the proposed taking the overpopulation of a
     particular species or population stock, the Secretary shall first
     consider whether or not it would be more desirable to transplant a
     number of animals (but not to exceed the number requested for taking
     in the application) of that species or stock to a location not then
     inhabited by such species or stock but previously inhabited by such
     species or stock.

   (c) [IMPORTATION FOR DISPLAY OR RESEARCH.] —

     (1) Any permit issued by the Secretary which authorizes the taking
     or importation of a marine mammal for purposes of scientific
     research, public display, or enhancing the survival or recovery of a
     species or stock shall specify, in addition to the conditions
     required by subsection (b) of this section, the methods of capture,
     supervision, care, and transportation which must be observed
     pursuant to such taking or importation. Any person authorized to
     take or import a marine mammal for purposes of scientific research,
     public display, or enhancing the survival or recovery of a species
     or stock shall furnish to the Secretary a report on all activities
     carried out by him pursuant to that authority.

     (2)

     (A) A permit may be issued to take or import a marine mammal for the
     purpose of public display only to a person which the Secretary
     determines—

     (i) offers a program for education or conservation purposes that is
     based on professionally recognized standards of the public display
     community;

     (ii) is registered or holds a license issued under 7 U.S.C. 2131 et
     seq. ; and

     (iii) maintains facilities for the public display of marine mammals
     that are open to the public on a regularly scheduled basis and that
     access to such facilities is not limited or restricted other than by
     charging of an admission fee.

     (B) A permit under this paragraph shall grant to the person to which
     it is issued the right, without obtaining any additional permit or
     authorization under this Act, to—

     (i) take, import, purchase, offer to purchase, possess, or transport
     the marine mammal that is the subject of the permit; and

     (ii) sell, export, or otherwise transfer possession of the marine
     mammal, or offer to sell, export, or otherwise transfer possession
     of the marine mammal—

     (I) for the purpose of public display, to a person that meets the
     requirements of clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of subparagraph (A);

     (II) for the purpose of scientific research, to a person that meets
     the requirements of paragraph (3); or

     (III) for the purpose of enhancing the survival or recovery of a
     species or stock, to a person that meets the requirements of
     paragraph (4).

     (C) A person to which a marine mammal is sold or exported or to
     which possession of a marine mammal is otherwise transferred under
     the authority of subparagraph (B) shall have the rights and
     responsibilities described in subparagraph (B) with respect to the
     marine mammal without obtaining any additional permit or
     authorization under this Act. Such responsibilities shall be limited
     to—

     (i) for the purpose of public display, the responsibility to meet
     the requirements of clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of subparagraph
     (A),

     (ii) for the purpose of scientific research, the responsibility to
     meet the requirements of paragraph (3), and

     (iii) for the purpose of enhancing the survival or recovery of a
     species or stock, the responsibility to meet the requirements of
     paragraph (4).

     (D) If the Secretary—

     (i) finds in concurrence with the Secretary of Agriculture, that a
     person that holds a permit under this paragraph for a marine mammal,
     or a person exercising rights under subparagraph (C), no longer
     meets the requirements of subparagraph (A)(ii) and is not reasonably
     likely to meet those requirements in the near future, or

     (ii) finds that a person that holds a permit under this paragraph
     for a marine mammal, or a person exercising rights under
     subparagraph (C), no longer meets the requirements of subparagraph
     (A) (i) or (iii) and is not reasonably likely to meet those
     requirements in the near future, the Secretary may revoke the permit
     in accordance with section 104(e), seize the marine mammal, or
     cooperate with other persons authorized to hold marine mammals under
     this Act for disposition of the marine mammal. The Secretary may
     recover from the person expenses incurred by the Secretary for that
     seizure.

     (E) No marine mammal held pursuant to a permit issued under
     subparagraph (A), or by a person exercising rights under
     subparagraph (C), may be sold, purchased, exported, or transported
     unless the Secretary is notified of such action no later than 15
     days before such action, and such action is for purposes of public
     display, scientific research, or enhancing the survival or recovery
     of a species or stock. The Secretary may only require the
     notification to include the information required for the inventory
     established under paragraph (10).

     (3)

     (A) The Secretary may issue a permit under this paragraph for
     scientific research purposes to an applicant which submits with its
     permit application information indicating that the taking is
     required to further a bona fide scientific purpose. The Secretary
     may issue a permit under this paragraph before the end of the public
     review and comment period required under subsection (d)(2) if
     delaying issuance of the permit could result in injury to a species,
     stock, or individual, or in loss of unique research opportunities.

     (B) No permit issued for purposes of scientific research shall
     authorize the lethal taking of a marine mammal unless the applicant
     demonstrates that a nonlethal method of conducting the research is
     not feasible. The Secretary shall not issue a permit for research
     which involves the lethal taking of a marine mammal from a species
     or stock that is depleted, unless the Secretary determines that the
     results of such research will directly benefit that species or
     stock, or that such research fulfills a critically important
     research need.

     (C) Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of the
     Marine Mammal Protection Act Amendments of 1994 [August 28, 1994],
     the Secretary shall issue a general authorization and implementing
     regulations allowing bona fide scientific research that may result
     only in taking by Level B harassment of a marine mammal. Such
     authorization shall apply to persons which submit, by 60 days before
     commencement of such research, a letter of intent via certified mail
     to the Secretary containing the following:

     (i) The species or stocks of marine mammals which may be harassed.

     (ii) The geographic location of the research.

     (iii) The period of time over which the research will be conducted.

     (iv) The purpose of the research, including a description of how the
     definition of bona fide research as established under this Act would
     apply.

     (v) Methods to be used to conduct the research. Not later than 30
     days after receipt of a letter of intent to conduct scientific
     research under the general authorization, the Secretary shall issue
     a letter to the applicant confirming that the general authorization
     applies, or, if the proposed research is likely to result in the
     taking (including Level A harassment) of a marine mammal, shall
     notify the applicant that subparagraph (A) applies.

     (4)

     (A) A permit may be issued for enhancing the survival or recovery of
     a species or stock only with respect to a species or stock for which
     the Secretary, after consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission
     and after notice and opportunity for public comment, has first
     determined that—

     (i) taking or importation is likely to contribute significantly to
     maintaining or increasing distribution or numbers necessary to
     ensure the survival or recovery of the species or stock; and

     (ii) taking or importation is consistent (I) with any conservation
     plan adopted by the Secretary under section 115(b) of this title or
     any recovery plan developed under section 4(f) of the Endangered
     Species Act of 1973 for the species or stock, or (II) if there is no
     conservation or recovery plan in place, with the Secretary's
     evaluation of actions required to enhance the survival or recovery
     of the species or stock in light to the factors that would be
     addressed in a conservation plan or a recovery plan.

     (B) A permit issued in accordance with this paragraph may allow the
     captive maintenance of a marine mammal from a depleted species or
     stock only if the Secretary—

     (i) determines that captive maintenance is likely to contribute to
     the survival or recovery of the species or stock by maintaining a
     viable gene pool, increasing productivity, providing biological
     information, or establishing animal reserves;

     (ii) determines that the expected benefit to the affected species or
     stock outweighs the expected benefit of alternatives which do not
     require removal of animals from the wild; and

     (iii) requires that the marine mammal or its progeny be returned to
     the natural habitat of the species or stock as soon as feasible,
     consistent with the objectives of any applicable conservation plan
     or recovery plan, or of any evaluation by the Secretary under
     subparagraph (A). The Secretary may allow the public display of such
     a marine mammal only if the Secretary determines that such display
     is incidental to the authorized maintenance and will not interfere
     with the attainment of the survival or recovery objectives.

     (5)

     (A) The Secretary may issue a permit for the importation of polar
     bear parts (other than internal organs) taken in sport hunts in
     Canada to an applicant which submits with its permit application
     proof that the polar bear was legally harvested in Canada by the
     applicant. Such a permit shall be issued if the Secretary, in
     consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission and after notice and
     opportunity for public comment, finds that—

     (i) Canada has a monitored and enforced sport hunting program
     consistent with the purposes of the Agreement on the Conservation of
     Polar Bears;

     (ii) Canada has a sport hunting program based on scientifically
     sound quotas ensuring the maintenance of the affected population
     stock at a sustainable level;

     (iii) the export and subsequent import are consistent with the
     provisions of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
     Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and other international agreements
     and conventions; and

     (iv) the export and subsequent import are not likely to contribute
     to illegal trade in bear parts.

     (B) The Secretary shall establish and charge a reasonable fee for
     permits issued under this paragraph. All fees collected under this
     paragraph shall be available to the Secretary until expended for use
     in developing and implementing cooperative research and management
     programs for the conservation of polar bears in Alaska and Russia
     pursuant to section 113(d).

     (C)

     (i) The Secretary shall undertake a scientific review of the impact
     of permits issued under this paragraph on the polar bear population
     stocks in Canada within 2 years after the date of enactment of this
     paragraph [April 30, 1996]. The Secretary shall provide an
     opportunity for public comment during the course of such review, and
     shall include a response to such public comment in the final report
     on such review.

     (ii) The Secretary shall not issue permits under this paragraph
     after September 30, 1996, if the Secretary determines, based on the
     scientific review, that the issuance of permits under this paragraph
     is having a significant adverse impact on the polar bear population
     stocks in Canada. The Secretary may review such determination
     annually thereafter, in light of the best scientific information
     available, and shall complete the review not later than January 31
     in any year a review is undertaken. The Secretary may issue permits
     under this paragraph whenever the Secretary determines, on the basis
     of such annual review, that the issuance of permits under this
     paragraph is not having a significant adverse impact on the polar
     bear population stocks in Canada.

     (D) The Secretary of the Interior shall, expeditiously after the
     expiration of the applicable 30 day period under subsection (d)(2),
     issue a permit for the importation of polar bear parts (other than
     internal organs) from polar bears taken in sport hunts in Canada
     before the date of enactment of the Marine Mammal Protection Act
     Amendments of 1994 [April 30, 1994], to each applicant who submits,
     with the permit application, proof that the polar bear was legally
     harvested in Canada by the applicant. The Secretary shall issue such
     permits without regard to the provisions of subparagraphs (A) and
     (C)(ii) of this paragraph, subsection (d)(3) of this section, and
     sections 101 and 102. This subparagraph shall not apply to polar
     bear parts that were imported before the effective date of this
     subparagraph [June 12, 1997].

     (6) A permit may be issued for photography for educational or
     commercial purposes involving marine mammals in the wild only to an
     applicant which submits with its permit application information
     indicating that the taking will be limited to Level B harassment,
     and the manner in which the products of such activities will be made
     available to the public.

     (7) Upon request by a person for a permit under paragraph (2), (3),
     or (4) for a marine mammal which is in the possession of any person
     authorized to possess it under this Act and which is determined
     under guidance under section 402(a) not to be releasable to the
     wild, the Secretary shall issue the permit to the person requesting
     the permit if that person—

     (A) meets the requirements of clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of
     paragraph (2)(A), in the case of a request for a permit under
     paragraph (2);

     (B) meets the requirements of paragraph (3), in the case of a
     request for a permit under that paragraph; or

     (C) meets the requirements of paragraph (4), in the case of a
     request for a permit under that paragraph.

     (8)

     (A) No additional permit or authorization shall be required to
     possess, sell, purchase, transport, export, or offer to sell or
     purchase the progeny of marine mammals taken or imported under this
     subsection, if such possession, sale, purchase, transport, export,
     or offer to sell or purchase is—

     (i) for the purpose of public display, and by or to, respectively, a
     person which meets the requirements of clauses (i), (ii), and (iii)
     of paragraph (2)(A);

     (ii) for the purpose of scientific research, and by or to,
     respectively, a person which meets the requirements of paragraph
     (3); or

     (iii) for the purpose of enhancing the survival or recovery of a
     species or stock, and by or to, respectively, a person which meets
     the requirements of paragraph (4).

     (B)

     (i) A person which has a permit under paragraph (2), or a person
     exercising rights under paragraph (2)(C), which has possession of a
     marine mammal that gives birth to progeny shall—

     (I) notify the Secretary of the birth of such progeny within 30 days
     after the date of birth; and

     (II) notify the Secretary of the sale, purchase, or transport of
     such progeny no later than 15 days before such action.

     (ii) The Secretary may only require notification under clause (i) to
     include the information required for the inventory established under
     paragraph (10).

     (C) Any progeny of a marine mammal born in captivity before the date
     of the enactment of the Marine Mammal Protection Act Amendments of
     1994 [April 30, 1994] and held in captivity for the purpose of
     public display shall be treated as though born after that date of
     enactment.

     (9) No marine mammal may be exported for the purpose of public
     display, scientific research, or enhancing the survival or recovery
     of a species or stock unless the receiving facility meets standards
     that are comparable to the requirements that a person must meet to
     receive a permit under this subsection for that purpose.

     (10) The Secretary shall establish and maintain an inventory of all
     marine mammals possessed pursuant to permits issued under paragraph
     (2)(A), by persons exercising rights under paragraph (2)(C), and all
     progeny of such marine mammals. The inventory shall contain, for
     each marine mammal, only the following information which shall be
     provided by a person holding a marine mammal under this Act:

     (A) The name of the marine mammal or other identification.

     (B) The sex of the marine mammal.

     (C) The estimated or actual birth date of the marine mammal.

     (D) The date of acquisition or disposition of the marine mammal by
     the permit holder.

     (E) The source from whom the marine mammal was acquired including
     the location of the take from the wild, if applicable.

     (F) If the marine mammal is transferred, the name of the recipient.

     (G) A notation if the animal was acquired as the result of a
     stranding.

     (H) The date of death of the marine mammal and the cause of death
     when determined.

   (d) [APPLICATION PROCEDURES; NOTICE; HEARING; REVIEW.] —

     (1) The Secretary shall prescribe such procedures as are necessary
     to carry out this section, including the form and manner in which
     application for permits may be made.

     (2) The Secretary shall publish notice in the Federal Register of
     each application made for a permit under this section. Such notice
     shall invite the submission from interested parties, within thirty
     days after the date of the notice, of written data or views, with
     respect to the taking or importation proposed in such application.

     (3) The applicant for any permit under this section must demonstrate
     to the Secretary that the taking or importation of any marine mammal
     under such permit will be consistent with the purposes of this Act
     and the applicable regulations established under section 103 of this
     title.

     (4) If within thirty days after the date of publication of notice
     pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection with respect to any
     application for a permit any interested party or parties request a
     hearing in connection therewith, the Secretary may, within sixty
     days following such date of publication, afford to such party or
     parties an opportunity for such a hearing.

     (5) As soon as practicable (but not later than thirty days) after
     the close of the hearing or, if no hearing is held, after the last
     day on which data, or views, may be submitted pursuant to paragraph
     (2) of this subsection, the Secretary shall (A) issue a permit
     containing such terms and conditions as he deems appropriate, or (B)
     shall deny issuance of a permit. Notice of the decision of the
     Secretary to issue or to deny any permit under this paragraph must
     be published in the Federal Register within ten days after the date
     of issuance or denial.

     (6) Any applicant for a permit, or any party opposed to such permit,
     may obtain judicial review of the terms and conditions of any permit
     issued by the Secretary under this section or of his refusal to
     issue such a permit. Such review, which shall be pursuant to chapter
     7 of Title 5, United States Code, may be initiated by filing a
     petition for review in the United States district court for the
     district wherein the applicant for a permit resides, or has his
     principal place of business, or in the United States District Court
     for the District of Columbia, within sixty days after the date on
     which such permit is issued or denied.

   (e) [MODIFICATION, SUSPENSION, AND REVOCATION.] —

     (1) The Secretary may modify, suspend, or revoke in whole or part
     any permit issued by him under this section—

     (A) in order to make any such permit consistent with any change made
     after the date of issuance of such permit with respect to any
     applicable regulation prescribed under section 103 of this title,

     (B) in any case in which a violation of the terms and conditions of
     the permit is found, or

     (C) if, in the case of a permit under subsection (c)(5) authorizing
     importation of polar bear parts, the Secretary, in consultation with
     the appropriate authority in Canada, determines that the
     sustainability of Canada's polar bear population stocks are being
     adversely affected or that sport hunting may be having a detrimental
     effect on maintaining polar bear population stocks throughout their
     range.

     (2) Whenever the Secretary shall propose any modification,
     suspension, or revocation of a permit under this subsection, the
     permittee shall be afforded opportunity, after due notice, for a
     hearing by the Secretary with respect to such proposed modification,
     suspension, or revocation. Such proposed action by the Secretary
     shall not take effect until a decision is issued by him after such
     hearing. Any action taken by the Secretary after such a hearing is
     subject to judicial review on the same basis as is any action taken
     by him with respect to a permit application under paragraph (5) of
     subsection (d) of this section.

     (3) Notice of the modification, suspension, or revocation of any
     permit by the Secretary shall be published in the Federal Register
     within ten days from the date of the Secretary's decision.

   (f) [POSSESSION OF PERMIT BY ISSUEE OR HIS AGENT.] — Any permit issued
   under this section must be in the possession of the person to whom it
   is issued (or an agent of such person) during—

     (1) the time of the authorized or taking importation;

     (2) the period of any transit of such person or agent which is
     incident to such taking or importation; and

     (3) any other time while any marine mammal taken or imported under
     such permit is in the possession of such person or agent. A
     duplicate copy of the issued permit must be physically attached to
     the container, package, enclosure, or other means of containment, in
     which the marine mammal is placed for purposes of storage, transit,
     supervision, or care.

   (g) [FEES.] — The Secretary shall establish and charge a reasonable fee
   for permits issued under this section.

   (h) [GENERAL PERMITS.] —

     (1) Consistent with the regulations prescribed pursuant to section
     103 of this title and to the requirements of section 101 of this
     title, the Secretary may issue an annual permit to a United States
     purse seine fishing vessel for the taking of such marine mammals,
     and shall issue regulations to cover the use of any such annual
     permits.

     (2) Such annual permits for the incidental taking of marine mammals
     in the course of commercial purse seine fishing for yellowfin tuna
     in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean shall be governed by section
     306 of this Act, subject to the regulations issued pursuant to
     section 303 of this Act.

     (3)

     (A) The Secretary shall, commencing on January 1, 1985, undertake a
     scientific research program to monitor for at least five consecutive
     years, and periodically as necessary thereafter, the indices of
     abundance and trends of marine mammal population stocks which are
     incidentally taken in the course of commercial purse seine fishing
     for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean.

     (B) If the Secretary determines, on the basis of the best scientific
     information available (including that obtained under the monitoring
     program), that the incidental taking of marine mammals permitted
     under the general permit referred to in paragraph (2) is having a
     significant adverse effect on a marine mammal population stock, the
     Secretary shall take such action as is necessary, after notice and
     an opportunity for an agency hearing on the record, to modify the
     applicable incidental take quotas or requirements for gear and
     fishing practices (or both such quotas and requirements) for such
     fishing so as to ensure that the marine mammal population stock is
     not significantly adversely affected by the incidental taking.

     (C) For each year after 1984, the Secretary shall include in his
     annual report to the public and the Congress under section 103(f) a
     discussion of the proposed activities to be conducted each year as
     part of the monitoring program required by subparagraph (A).

     (D) There are authorized to be appropriated to the Department of
     Commerce for purposes of carrying out the monitoring program
     required under this paragraph not to exceed $4,000,000 for the
     period beginning October 1, 1984, and ending September 30, 1988.

Section 105. Penalties

16 U.S.C. 1375 Sec. 105.

   (a)

     (1) Any person who violates any provision of this title or of any
     permit or regulation issued thereunder, except as provided in
     section 118, may be assessed a civil penalty by the Secretary of not
     more than $10,000 for each such violation. No penalty shall be
     assessed unless such person is given notice and opportunity for a
     hearing with respect to such violation. Each unlawful taking or
     importation shall be a separate offense. Any such civil penalty may
     be remitted or mitigated by the Secretary for good cause shown. Upon
     any failure to pay a penalty assessed under this subsection, the
     Secretary may request the Attorney General to institute a civil
     action in a district court of the United States for any district in
     which such person is found, resides, or transacts business to
     collect the penalty and such court shall have jurisdiction to hear
     and decide any such action.

     (2) In any case involving an alleged unlawful importation of a
     marine mammal or marine mammal product, if such importation is made
     by an individual for his own personal or family use (which does not
     include importation as an accommodation to others or for sale or
     other commercial use), the Secretary may, in lieu of instituting a
     proceeding under paragraph (1), allow the individual to abandon the
     mammal or product, under procedures to be prescribed by the
     Secretary, to the enforcement officer at the port of entry.

   (b) Any person who knowingly violates any provision of this title or of
   any permit or regulation issued thereunder (except as provided in
   section 118) shall, upon conviction, be fined not more than $20,000 for
   each such violation, or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.

Section []. Disposition of Fines

16 U.S.C. 1375a Sec. []

   Hereafter, all fines collected by the United States Fish and Wildlife
   Service for violations of the Marine Mammal Protection Act
   (16 U.S.C. 1362-1407) and implementing regulations shall be available
   to the Secretary, without further appropriation, to be used for the
   expenses of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in
   administering activities for the protection and recovery of manatees,
   polar bears, sea otters, and walruses, and shall remain available until
   expended.

Section 106. Vessel Fine, Cargo Forfeiture, and Rewards

16 U.S.C. 1376 Sec. 106.

   (a) [APPLICATION OF CONSISTENT PROVISIONS.] — Any vessel or other
   conveyance subject to the jurisdiction of the United States that is
   employed in any manner in the unlawful taking of any marine mammal
   shall have its entire cargo or the monetary value thereof subject to
   seizure and forfeiture. All provisions of law relating to the seizure,
   judicial forfeiture, and condemnation of cargo for violation of the
   customs laws, the disposition of such cargo, and the proceeds from the
   sale thereof, and the remission or mitigation of any such forfeiture,
   shall apply with respect to the cargo of any vessel or other conveyance
   seized in connection with the unlawful taking of a marine mammal
   insofar as such provisions of law are applicable and not inconsistent
   with the provisions of this title.

   (b) [PENALTIES.] — Any vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United
   States that is employed in any manner in the unlawful taking of any
   marine mammal shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than
   $25,000. Such penalty shall be assessed by the district court of the
   United States having jurisdiction over the vessel. Clearance of a
   vessel against which a penalty has been assessed, from a port of the
   United States, may be withheld until such penalty is paid, or until a
   bond or otherwise satisfactory surety is posted. Such penalty shall
   constitute a maritime lien on such vessel which may be recovered by
   action in rem in the district court of the United States having
   jurisdiction over the vessel.

   (c) [REWARD FOR INFORMATION LEADING TO CONVICTION.] — Upon the
   recommendation of the Secretary, the Secretary of the Treasury is
   authorized to pay an amount equal to one-half of the fine incurred but
   not to exceed $2, 500 to any person who furnishes information which
   leads to a conviction for a violation of this title. Any officer or
   employee of the United States or of any State or local government who
   furnishes information or renders service in the performance of his
   official duties shall not be eligible for payment under this section.

     bilateral or multinational agreements with other nations for the
     protection and conservation of all marine mammals covered by this
     Act;

     (2) initiate—

     (A) negotiations as soon as possible with all foreign governments
     which are engaged in, or which have persons or companies engaged in,
     commercial fishing operations which are found by the Secretary to be
     unduly harmful to any species or population stock of marine mammal,
     for the purpose of entering into bilateral and multilateral treaties
     with such countries to protect marine mammals, with the Secretary of
     State to prepare a draft agenda relating to this matter for
     discussion at appropriate international meetings and forums;

     (B) discussions with foreign governments whose vessels harvest
     yellowfin tuna with purse seines in the eastern tropical Pacific
     Ocean, for the purpose of concluding, through the Inter-American
     Tropical Tuna Commission or such other bilateral or multilateral
     institutions as may be appropriate, international arrangements for
     the conservation of marine mammals taken incidentally in the course
     of harvesting such tuna, which should include provisions for (i)
     cooperative research into alternative methods of locating and
     catching yellowfin tuna which do not involve the taking of marine
     mammals,

     (ii) cooperative research on the status of affected marine mammal
     population stocks,

     (iii) reliable monitoring of the number, rate, and species of marine
     mammals taken by vessels of harvesting nations,

     (iv) limitations on incidental take levels based upon the best
     scientific information available, and

     (v) the use of the best marine mammal safety techniques and
     equipment that are economically and technologically practicable to
     reduce the incidental kill and serious injury of marine mammals to
     insignificant levels approaching a zero mortality and serious injury
     rate;

     (C) negotiations to revise the Convention for the Establishment of
     an Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (1 U. S.T. 230; TIAS
     2044) which will incorporate--

     (i) the conservation and management provisions agreed to by the
     nations which have signed the Declaration of Panama and in the
     Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks Agreement,
     as opened for signature on December 4, 1995; and

     (ii) a revised schedule of annual contributions to the expenses of
     the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission that is equitable to
     participating nations; and

     (D) discussions with those countries participating, or likely to
     participate, in the International Dolphin Conservation Program, for
     the purpose of identifying sources of funds needed for research and
     other measures promoting effective protection of dolphins, other
     marine species, and the marine ecosystem;

     (3) encourage such other agreements to promote the purposes of this
     Act with other nations for the protection of specific ocean and land
     regions which are of special significance to the health and
     stability of marine mammals;

     (4) initiate the amendment of any existing international treaty for
     the protection and conservation of any species of marine mammal to
     which the United States is a party in order to make such treaty
     consistent with the purposes and policies of this Act;

     (5) seek the convening of an international ministerial meeting on

     and conservation of all marine mammals, and (B) the implementation
     of paragraph (3) of this section; and

     (6) provide to the Congress by not later than one year after the
     date of the enactment of this Act [October 21, 1973] a full report
     on the results of his efforts under this section.

   (b) [CONSULTATIONS AND STUDIES CONCERNING NORTH PACIFIC FUR SEALS.] —

     (1) In addition to the foregoing, the Secretary shall—

     (A) in consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission established by
     section 201 of this Act, undertake a study of the North Pacific fur
     seals to determine whether herds of such seals subject to the
     jurisdiction of the United States are presently at their optimum
     sustainable population and what population trends are evident; and

     (B) in consultation with the Secretary of State, promptly undertake
     a comprehensive study of the provisions of this Act, as they relate
     to North Pacific fur seals, and the provisions of the North Pacific
     Fur Seal Convention signed on February 9, 1957, as extended
     (hereafter referred to in this subsection as the "Convention"), to
     determine what modifications, if any, should be made to the
     provisions of the Convention, or of this Act, or both, to make the
     Convention and this Act consistent with each other. The Secretary
     shall complete the studies required under this paragraph not later
     than one year after the date of enactment of this Act [October 21,
     1973] and shall immediately provide copies thereof to Congress.

     (2) If the Secretary finds—

     (A) as a result of the study required under paragraph (1)(A) of this
     subsection, that the North Pacific fur seal herds are below their
     optimum sustainable population and are not trending upward toward
     such level, or have reached their optimum sustainable population but
     are commencing a downward trend, and believes the herds to be in
     danger of depletion; or

     (B) as a result of the study required under paragraph (1)(B) of this
     subsection, that modifications of the Convention are desirable to
     make it and this Act consistent; he shall, through the Secretary of
     State, immediately initiate negotiations to modify the Convention so
     as to

     (i) reduce or halt the taking of seals to the extent required to
     assure that such herds attain and remain at their optimum
     sustainable population, or

     (ii) make the Convention and this Act consistent; or both, as the
     case may be. If negotiations to so modify the Convention are
     unsuccessful, the Secretary shall, through the Secretary of State,
     take such steps as may be necessary to continue the existing
     Convention beyond its present termination date so as to continue to
     protect and conserve the North Pacific fur seals and to prevent a
     return to pelagic sealing.

   (c) [DESCRIPTION OF ANNUAL RESULTS OF DISCUSSIONS; PROPOSALS FOR
   FURTHER ACTION.] — The Secretary shall include a description of the
   annual results of discussions initiated and conducted pursuant to
   subsection (a)(2)(B), as well as any proposals for further action to
   achieve the purposes of that subsection, in the report required under
   section 103(f) of this title.

Section 109. Federal Cooperation With States

16 U.S.C. 1379 Sec. 109.

   (a) [STATE ENFORCEMENT OF STATE LAWS OR REGULATIONS PROHIBITED WITHOUT
   TRANSFER TO STATE OF MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY BY SECRETARY.] — No State may
   enforce, or attempt to enforce, any State law or regulation relating to
   the taking of any species (which term for purposes of this section
   includes any population stock) of marine mammal within the State unless
   the Secretary has transferred authority for the conservation and
   management of that species (hereinafter referred to in this section as
   "management authority") to the State under subsection (b)(1).

   (b) [FINDINGS PREREQUISITE TO TRANSFER OF AUTHORITY; STATE PROGRAM;
   IMPLEMENTATION.] —

     (1) Subject to paragraph (2) and subsection (f), the Secretary shall
     transfer management authority for a species of marine mammal to a
     State if the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for
     public comment, that the State has developed and will implement a
     program for the conservation and management of the species that—

     (A) is consistent with the purposes, policies, and goals of this Act
     and with international treaty obligations;

     (B) requires that all taking of the species be humane;

     (C) does not permit the taking of the species unless and until—

     (i) the State has determined, under a process consistent with the
     standards set forth in subsection (c)—

     (I) that the species is at its optimum sustainable population
     (hereinafter in this section referred to as "OSP"), and

     (II) the maximum number of animals of that species that may be taken
     without reducing the species below its OSP, and

     (ii) the determination required under clause (i) is final and
     implemented under State law, and, if a cooperative allocation
     agreement for the species is required under subsection (d)(1), such
     an agreement is implemented;

     (D) does not permit the taking of a number of animals of the species
     that exceeds the maximum number determined pursuant to subparagraph
     (C)(i)(II), and, in the case of taking for subsistence uses (as
     defined in subsection (f)(2)), does not permit the taking of a
     number of animals that would be inconsistent with the maintenance of
     the species at its OSP;

     (E) does not permit the taking of the species for scientific
     research, public display, or enhancing the survival or recovery of a
     species or stock, except for taking for such purposes that is
     undertaken by, or on behalf of, the State;

     (F) provides procedures for acquiring data, and evaluating such data
     and other new evidence, relating to the OSP of the species, and the
     maximum take that would maintain the species at that level, and, if
     required on the basis of such evaluation, for amending
     determinations under subparagraph (C)(i);

     (G) provides procedures for the resolution of differences between
     the State and the Secretary that might arise during the development
     of a cooperative allocation agreement under subsection (d)(1); and

     (H) provides for the submission of an annual report to the Secretary
     regarding the administration of the program during the reporting
     period.

     (2) During the period between the transfer of management authority
     for a species to a State under paragraph (1) and the time at which
     the implementation requirements under paragraph (1)(C)(ii) are
     complied with—

     (A) the State program shall not apply with respect to the taking of
     the species within the State for any purpose, or under any
     condition, provided for under section 101; and

     (B) the Secretary shall continue to regulate, under this title, all
     takings of the species within the State.

     (3) After the determination required under paragraph (1)(C)(i)
     regarding a species is final and implemented under State law and
     after a cooperative allocation agreement described in subsection
     (d)(1), if required, is implemented for such species—

     (A) such determination shall be treated, for purposes of applying
     this title beyond the territory of the State, as a determination
     made in accordance with section 103 and as an applicable waiver
     under section 101(a)(3);

     (B) the Secretary shall regulate, without regard to this section
     other than the allocations specified under such an agreement, the
     taking of the species—

     (i) incidentally in the course of commercial fishing operations
     (whether provided for under section 101(a)(2) or (4)), or in the
     course of other specified activities provided for under section
     101(a)(5), in the zone described in section 3(14)(B), and

     (ii) for scientific research, public display, or enhancing the
     survival or recovery of a species or stock (other than by, or on
     behalf of, the State), except that any taking authorized under a
     permit issued pursuant to section 101(a)(1) after the date of the
     enactment of the 1981 amendment to this sub- section [October 9,
     1981] allowing the removal of live animals from habitat within the
     State shall not be effective if the State agency disapproves, on or
     before the date of issuance of the permit, such taking as being
     inconsistent with the State program; and

     (C) section 101(b) shall not apply.

   (c) [STANDARDS WITH WHICH STATE PROCESS MUST COMPLY.] — The State
   process required under subsection (b)(1)(C) must comply with the
   following standards:

     (1) The State agency with management authority for the species
     (hereinafter in this section referred to as the "State agency") must
     make an initial determination regarding the factors described in
     clause (i) of that subsection. The State agency must identify, and
     make available to the public under reasonable circumstances, the
     documentation supporting such initial determination. Unless request
     for a hearing under paragraph (2) regarding the initial
     determination is timely made, the initial determination shall be
     treated as final under State law.

     (2) The State agency shall provide opportunity, at the request of
     any interested party, for a hearing with respect to the initial
     determination made by it under paragraph (1) at which interested
     parties may—

     (A) present oral and written evidence in support of or against such
     determination; and

     (B) cross-examine persons presenting evidence at the hearing. The
     State agency must give public notice of the hearing and make
     available to the public within a reasonable time before commencing
     the hearing a list of the witnesses for the State and a general
     description of the documentation and other evidence that will be
     relied upon by such witnesses.

     (3) The State agency, solely on the basis of the record developed at
     a hearing held pursuant to paragraph (2), must make a decision
     regarding its initial determination under paragraph (1) and shall
     include with the record a statement of the findings and conclusions,
     and the reason or basis therefor, on all material issues.

     (4) Opportunity for judicial review of the decision made by the
     State agency on the record under paragraph (3), under scope of
     review equivalent to that provided for in section 706(2) (A) through
     (E) of Title 5, United States Code, must be available under State
     law. The Secretary may not initiate judicial review of any such
     decision.

   (d) [COOPERATIVE ALLOCATION AGREEMENTS.] —

     (1) If the range of a species with respect to which a determination
     under paragraph (1)(C)(i) of subsection (b) is made extends beyond
     the territorial waters of the State, the State agency and the
     Secretary (who shall first coordinate with the Marine Mammal
     Commission and the appropriate Regional Fishery Management Council
     established under section 302 of the Act of April 13, 1976
     (16 U.S.C. 1852)) shall enter into a cooperative allocation
     agreement providing procedures for allocating, on a timely basis,
     such of the number of animals, as determined under paragraph
     (1)(C)(i)(II) of subsection (b), as may be appropriate with priority
     of allocation being given firstly to taking for subsistence uses in
     the case of the State of Alaska, and secondly to taking for purposes
     provided for under section 101(a) within the zone described in
     section 3(14)(B).

     (2) If the State agency requests the Secretary to regulate the
     taking of a species to which paragraph (1) applies within the zone
     described in section 3(14)(B) for subsistence uses or for hunting,
     or both, in a manner consistent with the regulation by the State
     agency of such taking within the State, the Secretary shall adopt,
     and enforce within such zone, such of the State agency's regulatory
     provisions as the Secretary considers to be consistent with his
     administration of section 101(a) within such zone. The Secretary
     shall adopt such provisions through the issuance of regulations
     under section 553 of Title 5, United States Code, and with respect
     to such issuance the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Paperwork
     Reduction Act, Executive Order No. 12291, dated February 17, 1981,
     and the thirty-day notice requirement in subsection (d) of such
     section 553 shall not apply. For purposes of sections 105, 106, and
     107, such regulations shall be treated as having been issued under
     this title.

   (e) [REVOCATION OF TRANSFER OF MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY.] —

     (1) Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary shall revoke, after
     opportunity for a hearing, any transfer of management authority made
     to a State under subsection (b)(1) if the Secretary finds that the
     State program for the conservation and management of the species
     concerned is not being implemented, or is being implemented in a
     manner inconsistent with the provisions of this section or the
     provisions of the program. The Secretary shall also establish a
     procedure for the voluntary return by a State to the Secretary of
     species management authority that was previously transferred to the
     State under subsection (b)(1).

     (2)

     (A) The Secretary may not revoke a transfer of management authority
     under paragraph (1) unless—

     (i) The Secretary provides to the State a written notice of intent
     to revoke together with a statement, in detail, of those actions, or
     failures to act, on which such intent is based; and

     (ii) during the ninety-day period after the date of the notice of
     intent to revoke—

     (I) the Secretary provides opportunity for consultation between him
     and the State concerning such State actions or failures to act and
     the remedial measures that should be taken by the State, and

     (II) the State does not take such remedial measures as are
     necessary, in the judgment of the Secretary, to bring its
     conservation and management program, or the administration or
     enforcement of the program, into compliance with the provisions of
     this section.

     (B) When a revocation by the Secretary of a transfer of management
     authority to a State becomes final, or the State voluntarily returns
     management authority to the Secretary, the Secretary shall regulate
     the taking, and provide for the conservation and management, of the
     species within the State in accordance with the provisions of this
     Act (and in the case of Alaskan Natives, section 101(b) and
     subsection (i) of this section shall apply upon such revocation or
     return of management authority).

   (f) [TRANSFER OF MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY TO STATE OF ALASKA.] —

     (1) The Secretary may not transfer management authority to the State
     of Alaska under subsection (b)(1) for any species of marine mammal
     unless—

     (A) the State has adopted and will implement a statute and
     regulations that insure that the taking of the species for
     subsistence uses—

     (i) is accomplished in a nonwasteful manner,

     (ii) will be the priority consumptive use of the species, and

     (iii) if required to be restricted, such restriction will be based
     upon—

     (I) the customary and direct dependence upon the species as the
     mainstay of livelihood,

     (II) local residency, and

     (III) the availability of alternative resources; and

     (B) the State has adopted a statute or regulation that requires that
     any consumptive use of marine mammal species, other than for
     subsistence uses, will be authorized during a regulatory year only
     if the appropriate agency first makes findings, based on an
     administrative record before it, that—

     (i) such use will have no significant adverse impact upon
     subsistence uses of the species, and

     (ii) the regulation of such use, including, but not limited to,
     licensing of marine mammal hunting guides and the assignment of
     guiding areas, will, to the maximum extent practicable, provide
     economic opportunities for the residents of the rural coastal
     villages of Alaska who engage in subsistence uses of that species.

     (2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term "subsistence uses" means
     the customary and traditional uses by rural Alaska residents of
     marine mammals for direct personal or family consumption as food,
     shelter, fuel, clothing, tools, or transportation; for the making
     and selling of handicraft articles out of nonedible byproducts of
     marine mammals taken for personal or family consumption; and for
     barter, or sharing for personal or family consumption. As used in
     this paragraph—

     (A) The term "family" means all persons related by blood, marriage,
     or adoption, or any person living within a household on a permanent
     basis.

     (B) The term "barter" means the exchange of marine mammals or their
     parts, taken for subsistence uses—

     (i) for other wildlife or fish or their parts, or

     (ii) for other food or for nonedible items other than money if the
     exchange is of a limited and noncommercial nature.

   (g) [ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT NOT REQUIRED.] — Neither the
   transfer of management authority to a State under subsection (b)(1),
   nor the revocation or voluntary return of such authority under
   subsection (e), shall be deemed to be an action for which an
   environmental impact statement is required under section 102 of the

     Atmosphere for expenses incurred in the granting and administration
     of exemptions under this section.

   (c) [COMPILATION OF INFORMATION BY VESSEL OWNERS; CONTENTS.] — The
   owner of each vessel holding an exemption granted under subsection (b)
   of this section shall regularly compile information which shall be used
   in a report to be submitted to the Secretary at the close of the
   fishing season or annually, as the Secretary may prescribe. Such report
   shall be submitted in such form as the Secretary may require and shall
   include the following:

     (1) the type of fishery engaged in by the owner's vessel;

     (2) the date and approximate time of any incidental taking of a
     marine mammal, together with the area in which the incidental taking
     occurred, the fishing gear used at the time of the incidental
     taking, and the species of fish involved; and

     (3) for each incidental taking, the number and species of marine
     mammals involved, whether the marine mammals were deterred from gear
     or catch, incidentally injured, incidentally killed, or lethally
     removed to protect gear, catch, or human life. If there was no
     incidental taking of marine mammals during the reporting period, a
     report stating that fact shall be filed with the Secretary.

   (d) [PROGRAM FOR ENHANCEMENT AND VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION RECEIVED
   FROM VESSEL OWNERS; CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION.] —

     (1) The Secretary shall establish a program to enhance the quality
     of and verify information received from reports submitted by owners
     of vessels who have been granted an exemption under subsection (b)
     of this section. The program shall include, but not be limited to—

     (A) education efforts regarding the information that must be
     submitted;

     (B) interviews with fishermen; and

     (C) other such information gathering and verification activities
     that will enable the Secretary to determine reliably the nature,
     type, and extent of the incidental taking of marine mammals that
     occurs in a fishery. Except to the extent authorized by the
     provisions of subsection (e), the program shall not include
     placement of observers aboard exempted vessels.

     (2) Information obtained under this subsection shall be subject to
     the confidentiality provisions of subsection (j).

   (e) [OBSERVERS ON BOARD EXEMPTED VESSELS; CONFIDENTIALITY OF
   INFORMATION; AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.] —

     (1) For each fishery identified under subsection (b)(1)(A)(i) of
     this section, the Secretary shall, after consultation with the
     appropriate Regional Fishery Management Councils, other Federal and
     State agencies, and other interested parties, and subject to
     paragraph (6), place observers on board exempted vessels so as to
     monitor not less than 20 percent nor more than 35 percent of the
     fishing operations by vessels in the fishery to obtain statistically
     reliable information on the species and number of marine mammals
     incidentally taken in the fishery. If the Secretary determines that
     fewer than 20 percent of the fishing operations by vessels in the
     fishery will be monitored during the course of the fishing season,
     the Secretary shall implement the alternative observation program
     described in subsection (f) to the extent necessary to supplement
     the observer program described in this subsection.

     (2) When determining the distribution of observers among fisheries
     and between vessels in a particular fishery, the Secretary shall be
     guided by the following standards:

     (A) the requirement to obtain the best scientific information
     available;

     (B) the requirement that assignment of observers is fair and
     equitable among fisheries and among vessels in a fishery;

     (C) consistent with paragraph (1), the requirement that no
     individual person or vessel, or group of persons or vessels, be
     subject to excessive or overly burdensome observer coverage; and

     (D) where practicable, the need to minimize costs and avoid
     duplication.

     (3) If the Secretary finds that, for reasons beyond his or her
     control, the Secretary cannot assign observers to all the fisheries
     identified under subsection (b)(1)(A)(i) of this section at the
     level of observer coverage set forth in paragraph (1), the Secretary
     shall allocate available observers among such fisheries, consistent
     with paragraph (2), according to the following priority:

     (A) those fisheries that incidentally take marine mammals from any
     population stock designated as depleted;

     (B) those fisheries that incidentally take marine mammals from
     population stocks that the Secretary believes are declining;

     (C) those fisheries other than those described in subparagraphs (A)
     and (B) in which the greatest incidental take of marine mammals
     occur; and

     (D) any other fishery identified under subsection (b)(1)(A)(i). The
     Secretary may, with the consent of the vessel owner, station an
     observer on board a vessel engaged in a fishery not identified under
     subsection (b)(1)(A)(i).

     (4) Information gathered by observers shall be subject to the
     provisions of subsection (j). Consistent with the requirements of
     paragraph (1), the Secretary shall, if requested by the Appropriate
     Regional Fishery Management Council, or in the case of a State
     fishery, the State, require observers to collect additional
     information, including but not limited to the quantities, species,
     and physical condition of target and non- target fishery resources
     and, if requested by the Secretary of the Interior, seabirds.

     (5) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (4), the Secretary
     may decline to require observers to collect information described in
     such paragraph, if the Secretary finds in writing, following public
     notice and opportunity for comment, that such information will not
     contribute to the protection of marine mammals or the understanding
     of the marine ecosystem, including fishery resources and seabirds.

     (6) The Secretary shall not be required to place an observer on a
     vessel in a fishery if the Secretary finds that—

     (A) in a situation where harvesting vessels are delivering fish to a
     processing vessel and the catch is not taken on board the harvesting
     vessel, statistically reliable information can be obtained from an
     observer on board the processing vessel to which the fish are
     delivered;

     (B) the facilities of a vessel for the quartering of an observer, or
     for carrying out observer functions, are so inadequate or unsafe
     that the health or safety of the observer or the safe operation of
     the vessel would be jeopardized; or

     (C) for reasons beyond the control of the Secretary, an observer is
     not available.

     (7)

     (A) An observer on a vessel (or the observer's personal
     representative) under the requirements of this section or section
     104 that is ill, disabled, injured, or killed from service as an
     observer on that vessel may not bring a civil action under any law
     of the United States for that illness, disability, injury, or death
     against the vessel or vessel owner, except that a civil action may
     be brought against the vessel owner for the owner's willful
     misconduct.

     (B) This paragraph does not apply if the observer is engaged by the
     owner, master, or individual in charge of a vessel to perform any
     duties in service to the vessel.

     (8) There are authorized to be appropriated to the Department of
     Commerce for the purposes of carrying out this subsection not to
     exceed $2,700,000 for fiscal year 1989 and not to exceed $8,000,000
     for each of the fiscal years 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1993.

   (f) [ALTERNATIVE OBSERVATION PROGRAM.] —

     (1) The Secretary shall establish an alternative observation program
     to provide statistically reliable information on the species and
     number of marine mammals incidentally taken in those fisheries
     identified pursuant to subsection (b)(1)(A)(i) of this section for
     which the required level of observer coverage has not been met or
     for any other fisheries about which such reliable information is not
     otherwise available. The alternative program shall include, but not
     be limited to, direct observation of fishing activities from
     vessels, airplanes, or points on shore.

     (2) Individuals engaged in the alternative observation program shall
     collect scientific information on the fisheries subject to
     observation, consistent with the requirements of paragraph (1) and
     subsection (e) (4) and (5). All information collected shall be
     subject to the provisions of subsection (j).

   (g) [REVIEW OF INFORMATION AND EVALUATION OF EFFECTS OF INCIDENTAL
   TAKING ON POPULATION STOCKS OF MARINE MAMMALS; PROMULGATION OF
   EMERGENCY REGULATIONS TO MITIGATE IMMEDIATE AND SEVERE IMPACTS; ACTION
   TO MITIGATE NON-IMMEDIATE IMPACTS.] —

     (1) The Secretary shall review information regarding the incidental
     taking of marine mammals and evaluate the effects of such incidental
     taking on the affected population stocks of marine mammals.

     (2) If the Secretary finds, based on the information received from
     the programs established under subsections (c), (d), (e), and (f),
     that the incidental taking of marine mammals in a fishery is having
     an immediate and significant adverse impact on a marine mammal
     population stock or, in the case of Steller sea lions and North
     Pacific fur seals, that more than 1,350 and 50, respectively, will
     be incidentally killed during a calendar year, the Secretary shall
     consult with appropriate Regional Fishery Management Councils and
     State fishery managers and prescribe emergency regulations to
     prevent to the maximum extent practicable any further taking. Any
     emergency regulations prescribed under this paragraph—

     (A) shall, to the maximum extent practicable, avoid interfering with
     existing State or regional fishery management plans;

     (B) shall be published in the Federal Register together with the
     reasons therefor;

     (C) shall remain in effect for not more than one hundred and eighty
     days or until the end of the fishing season, whichever is earlier;
     and

     (D) may be terminated by the Secretary at an earlier date by
     publication in the Federal Register of a notice of termination if
     the Secretary determines the reasons for the emergency regulations
     no longer exist. In prescribing emergency regulations under this
     paragraph, the Secretary shall take into account the economics of
     the fishery concerned and the availability of existing technology to
     prevent or minimize incidental taking of marine mammals.

     (3) If the Secretary finds, based on information received from the
     programs established under subsections (c), (d), (e), and (f), that
     incidental taking of marine mammals in a fishery is not having an
     immediate and significant adverse impact on a marine mammal
     population stock but that it will likely have a significant adverse
     impact over a period of time longer than one year, the Secretary
     shall request the appropriate Regional Fishery Management Council or
     State to initiate, recommend, or take such action within its
     authority as it considers necessary to mitigate the adverse impacts,
     including adjustments to requirements on fishing times or areas or
     the imposition of restrictions on the use of vessels or gear.

     (4) The Secretary shall impose appropriate conditions and
     restrictions on an exemption granted under subsection (b) if—

     (A) a Regional Fishery Management Council or State does not act in a
     reasonable period of time on a request made by the Secretary under
     paragraph (3); or

     (B) if the Secretary determines after notice and opportunity for
     public comment that the purposes of this section would be better
     served by such action.

   (h) [INFORMATION AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR PROCESSING AND ANALYZING
   REPORTS AND INFORMATION; ACCESSIBILITY TO PUBLIC.] — The Secretary
   shall design and implement an information management system capable of
   processing and analyzing reports received from the programs established
   under subsections (c), (d), (e), and (f), and other relevant sources,
   including Federal and State enforcement authorities, marine mammal
   stranding networks, and the marine mammal researchers. The information
   shall be made accessible to the public on a continuing basis, but in
   any case no later than six months after it is received, subject to the
   provisions of subsection (j).

   (i) [UTILIZATION OF SERVICES OF STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES AND PRIVATE
   ENTITIES.] — When carrying out the Secretary's responsibilities under
   subsections (b), (d), (e), (f), and (h) of this section, the Secretary
   shall, to the maximum extent practicable, utilize the services and
   programs of State agencies, Federal agencies (including programs
   established by Regional Fishery Management Councils), marine fisheries
   commissions, universities, and private entities, on a reimbursable
   basis or otherwise. The Secretary is authorized to enter into contracts
   and agreements to carry out his or her responsibilities and shall
   establish appropriate guidelines to ensure that other programs used or
   contracted for will meet the same standards as a program established by
   the Secretary. A person contracting with the Secretary to provide
   observer services under subsection (e) of this section must provide
   evidence of financial responsibility in an amount and form prescribed
   by the Secretary to compensate employees (or their survivors)
   adequately for any illness, disability, injury, or death from service
   on a vessel.

   (j) [CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION; EXCEPTIONS.] —

     (1) Any information collected under subsection (c), (d), (e), (f),
     or (h) of this section shall be confidential and shall not be
     disclosed except—

     (A) to Federal employees whose duties require access to such
     information;

     (B) to State employees pursuant to an agreement with the Secretary
     that prevents public disclosure of the identity or business of any
     person;

     (C) when required by court order; or

     (D) in the case of scientific information involving fisheries, to
     employees of Regional Fishery Management Councils who are
     responsible for fishery management plan development and monitoring.

     (2) The Secretary shall prescribe such procedures as may be
     necessary to preserve such confidentiality, except that the
     Secretary shall release or make public any such information in
     aggregate, summary, or other form which does not directly or
     indirectly disclose the identity or business of any person.

   (k) [REGULATIONS.] — The Secretary, in consultation with any other
   Federal agency to the extent that such agency may be affected, shall
   prescribe such regulations as necessary and appropriate to carry out
   the purposes of this section.

   (l) [SUGGESTED REGIME GOVERNING INCIDENTAL TAKING OF MARINE MAMMALS
   FOLLOWING TERMINATION OF INTERIM EXEMPTIONS.] —

     (1) The Chairman of the Marine Mammal Commission shall, after
     consultation with interested parties and not later than February 1,
     1990, transmit to the Secretary and make available to the public
     recommended guidelines to govern the incidental taking of marine
     mammals in the course of commercial fishing operations, other than
     those subject to section 104(h)(2), after October 1, 1993. Such
     guidelines shall be developed by the Commission and its Committee of
     Scientific Advisers 10 on Marine Mammals and shall—

     (A) be designed to provide a scientific rationale and basis for
     determining how many marine mammals may be incidentally taken under
     a regime to be adopted to govern such taking after October 1, 1993;

     (B) be based on sound principles of wildlife management, and be
     consistent with and in furtherance of the purposes and policies set
     forth in this Act; and

     (C) to the maximum extent practicable, include as factors to be
     considered and utilized in determining permissible levels of such
     taking—

     (i) the status and trends of the affected marine mammal population
     stocks;

     (ii) the abundance and annual net recruitment of such stocks;

     (iii) the level of confidence in the knowledge of the affected
     stocks; and

     (iv) the extent to which incidental taking will likely cause or
     contribute to their decline or prevent their recovery to optimum
     sustainable population levels.

     (2) The Secretary shall advise the Chairman of the Commission in
     writing if the Secretary determines that any additional information
     or explanation of the Chairman's recommendations is needed, and the
     Chairman shall respond in writing to any such request by the
     Secretary.

     (3) On or before February 1, 1991, the Secretary, after consultation
     with the Marine Mammal Commission, Regional Fishery Management
     Councils, and other interested governmental and nongovernmental
     organizations, shall publish in the Federal Register, for public
     comment, the suggested regime that the Secretary considers should,
     if authorized by enactment of any additional legislation, govern
     incidental taking of marine mammals, other than those subject to
     section 104(h)(2), after October 1, 1993. The suggested regime shall
     include—

     (A) the scientific guidelines to be used in determining permissible
     levels of incidental taking;

     (B) a description of the arrangements for consultation and
     cooperation with other Federal agencies, the appropriate Regional
     Fishery Management Councils and States, the commercial fishing
     industry, and conservation organizations; and

     (C) a summary of such regulations and legislation as would be
     necessary to implement the suggested regime.

     (4) On or before January 1, 1992, the Secretary, after consultation
     with the Marine Mammal Commission, and consideration of public
     comment, shall transmit to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
     Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Merchant Marine
     and Fisheries of the House of Representatives recommendations
     pertaining to the incidental taking of marine mammals, other than
     those subject to section 104(h)(2), after October 1, 1993. The
     recommendations shall include—

     (A) the suggested regime developed under paragraph (3) of this
     subsection as modified after comment and consultations;

     (B) a proposed schedule for implementing the suggested regime; and

     (C) such recommendations for additional legislation as the Secretary
     considers necessary or desirable to implement the suggested regime.

   (m) [CONSULTATION WITH SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.] — The Secretary
   shall consult with the Secretary of the Interior prior to taking
   actions or making determinations under this section that affect or
   relate to species or population stocks of marine mammals for which the
   Secretary of the Interior is responsible under this title.

   (n) [OWNER OF FIXED COMMERCIAL FISHING GEAR DEEMED OWNER OF VESSEL
   ENGAGED IN FISHERY IN WHICH GEAR DEPLOYED.] — For the purposes of this
   section, the owner of fixed or other commercial fishing gear that is
   deployed with or without the use of a vessel shall be deemed to be an
   owner of a vessel engaged in the fishery in which that gear is
   deployed.

   (o) [DEFINITIONS.] — As used in this section—

     (1) the term "fishery" has the same meaning as it does in section
     3(8) of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management
     Act (16 U. S.C. 1802(8)).

     (2) the term "Secretary" means the Secretary of Commerce.

     (3) the term "vessel engaged in a fishery" means a fishing vessel as
     defined in section 2101(11a) of Title 46, United States Code, or a
     fish processing vessel as defined in section 2101(11b) of that
     title, which is engaged in fishery.

     (4) the term "vessel of the United States" has the same meaning as
     it does in section 3(27) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery
     Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1802(27)).

Section 115. Status Review; Conservation Plans

16 U.S.C. 1383b Sec. 115.

   (a) [DETERMINATIONS BY RULE; NOTICE AND HEARING; FINDINGS; FINAL RULE
   ON STATUS OF SPECIES OR STOCK INVOLVED.] —

     (1) In any action by the Secretary to determine if a species or
     stock should be designated as depleted, or should no longer be
     designated as depleted, regardless of whether such action is taken
     on the initiative of the Secretary or in response to a petition for
     a status review, the Secretary shall only make such a determination
     by issuance of a rule, after notice and opportunity for public
     comment and after a call for information in accordance with
     paragraph (2).

     (2) The Secretary shall make any determination described in
     paragraph (1) solely on the basis of the best scientific information
     available. Prior to the issuance of a proposed rule concerning any
     such determination, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal
     Register a call to assist the Secretary in obtaining scientific
     information from individuals and organizations concerned with the
     conservation of marine mammals, from persons in industry which might
     be affected by the determination, and from academic institutions. In
     addition, the Secretary shall utilize, to the extent the Secretary
     determines to be feasible, informal working groups of interested
     parties and other methods to gather the necessary information.

     (3)

     (A) If the Secretary receives a petition for a status review as
     described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall publish a notice in
     the Federal Register that such a petition has been received and is
     available for public review.

     (B) Within sixty days after receipt of the petition, the Secretary
     shall publish a finding in the Federal Register as to whether the
     petition presents substantial information indicating that the
     petitioned action may be warranted.

     (C) If the Secretary makes a positive finding under subparagraph
     (B), the Secretary shall include in the Federal Register notice, a
     finding that—

     (i) a review of the status of the species or stock will be commenced
     promptly; or

     (ii) a prompt review of the petition is precluded by other pending
     status determination petitions and that expeditious progress is
     being made to process pending status determination petitions under
     this title. In no case after making a finding under this
     subparagraph shall the Secretary delay commencing a review of the
     status of a species or stock for more than one hundred and twenty
     days after receipt of the petition.

     (D) No later than two hundred and ten days after the receipt of the
     petition, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a
     proposed rule as to the status of the species or stock, along with
     the reasons underlying the proposed status determination. Persons
     shall have at least sixty days to submit comments on such a proposed
     rule.

     (E) Not later than ninety days after the close of the comment period
     on a proposed rule issued under subparagraph (D), the Secretary
     shall issue a final rule on the status of the species or stock
     involved, along with the reasons for the status determination. If
     the Secretary finds with respect to such a proposed rule that there
     is substantial disagreement regarding the sufficiency or accuracy of
     the available information relevant to a status determination, the
     Secretary may delay the issuance of a final rule for a period of not
     more than six months for purposes of soliciting additional
     information.

     (F) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (D) and (E) of this paragraph and
     section 553 of Title 5, United States Code, the Secretary may issue
     a final rule as to the status of a species or stock any time sixty
     or more days after a positive finding under subparagraph (B) if the
     Secretary determines there is substantial information available to
     warrant such final status determination and further delay would pose
     a significant risk to the well-being of any species or stock. Along
     with the final rule, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal
     Register detailed reasons for the expedited determination.

   (b) [CONSERVATION PLANS; PREPARATION AND IMPLEMENTATION.] —

     (1) The Secretary shall prepare conservation plans—

     (A) by December 31, 1989, for North Pacific fur seals;

     (B) by December 31, 1990, for Steller sea lions; and

     (C) as soon as possible, for any species or stock designated as
     depleted under this title, except that a conservation plan need not
     be prepared if the Secretary determines that it will not promote the
     conservation of the species or stock.

     (2) Each plan shall have the purpose of conserving and restoring the
     species or stock to its optimum sustainable population. The
     Secretary shall model such plans on recovery plans required under
     section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973
     (16 U.S.C. 1533(f)).

     (3) The Secretary shall act expeditiously to implement each
     conservation plan prepared under paragraph (1). Each year, the
     Secretary shall specify in the annual report prepared under section
     103(f) of this title what measures have been taken to prepare and
     implement such plans.

     (4) If the Secretary determines that a take reduction plan is
     necessary to reduce the incidental taking of marine mammals in the
     course of commercial fishing operations from a strategic stock, or
     for species or stocks which interact with a commercial fishery for
     which the Secretary has made a determination under section
     118(f)(1), any conservation plan prepared under this subsection for
     such species or stock shall incorporate the take reduction plan
     required under section 118 for such species or stock.

Section []. Dolphin Protection

16 U.S.C. 1385 Sec. []

   (a) SHORT TITLE. — This section may be cited as the "Dolphin Protection
   Consumer Information Act" .

   (b) FINDINGS. — The Congress finds that—

     (1) dolphins and other marine mammals are frequently killed in the
     course of tuna fishing operations in the eastern tropical Pacific
     Ocean and high seas driftnet fishing in other parts of the world;

     (2) it is the policy of the United States to support a worldwide ban
     on high seas driftnet fishing, in part because of the harmful
     effects that such driftnets have on marine mammals, including
     dolphins; and

     (3) consumers would like to know if the tuna they purchase is
     falsely labeled as to the effect of the harvesting of the tuna on
     dolphins.

   (c) DEFINITIONS. — For the purposes of this section—

     (1) the terms "driftnet" and "driftnet fishing" have the meanings
     given those terms in section 4003 of the Driftnet Impact Monitoring,
     Assessment, and Control Act of 1987 (16 U. S.C. 1822 note);

     (2) the term "eastern tropical Pacific Ocean" means the area of the
     Pacific Ocean bounded by 40 degrees north latitude, 40 degrees south
     latitude, 160 degrees west longitude, and the western coastlines of
     North, Central, and South America;

     (3) the term "label" means a display of written, printed, or graphic
     matter on or affixed to the immediate container of any article;

     (4) the term "Secretary" means the Secretary of Commerce; and

     (5) the term "tuna product" means a food item which contains tuna
     and which has been processed for retail sale, except perishable
     sandwiches, salads, or other products with a shelf life less than 3
     days.

   (d) LABELING STANDARD. —

     (1) It is a violation of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission
     Act (15 U.S.C. 45) for any producer, importer, exporter,
     distributor, or seller of any tuna product that is exported from or
     offered for sale in the United States to include on the label of
     that product the term "dolphin safe" or any other term or symbol
     that falsely claims or suggests that the tuna contained in the
     product were harvested using a method of fishing that is not harmful
     to dolphins if the product contains tuna harvested--

     (A) on the high seas by a vessel engaged in driftnet fishing;

     (B) outside the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean by a vessel using
     purse seine nets--

     (i) in a fishery in which the Secretary has determined that a
     regular and significant association occurs between dolphins and tuna
     (similar to the association between dolphins and tuna in the eastern
     tropical Pacific Ocean), unless such product is accompanied by a
     written statement, executed by the captain of the vessel and an
     observer participating in a national or international program
     acceptable to the Secretary, certifying that no purse seine net was
     intentionally deployed on or used to encircle dolphins during the
     particular voyage on which the tuna were caught and no dolphins were
     killed or seriously injured in the sets in which the tuna were
     caught; or

     (ii) in any other fishery (other than a fishery described in
     subparagraph (D)) unless the product is accompanied by a written
     statement executed by the captain of the vessel certifying that no
     purse seine net was intentionally deployed on or used to encircle
     dolphins during the particular voyage on which the tuna was
     harvested;

     (C) in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean by a vessel using a purse
     seine net unless the tuna meet the requirements for being considered
     dolphin safe under paragraph (2); or

     (D) by a vessel in a fishery other than one described in
     subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) that is identified by the Secretary as
     having a regular and significant mortality or serious injury of
     dolphins, unless such product is accompanied by a written statement
     executed by the captain of the vessel and an observer participating
     in a national or international program acceptable to the Secretary
     that no dolphins were killed or seriously injured in the sets or
     other gear deployments in which the tuna were caught, provided that
     the Secretary determines that such an observer statement is
     necessary.

     (2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(C), a tuna product that contains
     tuna harvested in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean by a vessel
     using purse seine nets is dolphin safe if--

     (A) the vessel is of a type and size that the Secretary has
     determined, consistent with the International Dolphin Conservation
     Program, is not capable of deploying its purse seine nets on or to
     encircle dolphins; or

     (B)

     (i) the product is accompanied by a written statement executed by
     the captain providing the certification required under subsection
     (h);

     (ii) the product is accompanied by a written statement executed by--

     (I) the Secretary or the Secretary's designee;

     (II) a representative of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna
     Commission; or

     (III) an authorized representative of a participating nation whose
     national program meets the requirements of the International Dolphin
     Conservation Program, which states that there was an observer
     approved by the International Dolphin Conservation Program on board
     the vessel during the entire trip and that such observer provided
     the certification required under subsection (h); and

     (iii) the statements referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) are
     endorsed in writing by each exporter, importer, and processor of the
     product; and

     (C) the written statements and endorsements referred to in
     subparagraph (B) comply with regulations promulgated by the
     Secretary which provide for the verification of tuna products as
     dolphin safe.

     (3)

     (A) The Secretary of Commerce shall develop an official mark that
     may be used to label tuna products as dolphin safe in accordance
     with this Act.

     (B) A tuna product that bears the dolphin safe mark developed under
     subparagraph (A) shall not bear any other label or mark that refers
     to dolphins, porpoises, or marine mammals.

     (C) It is a violation of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission
     Act (15 U.S.C. 45) to label a tuna product with any label or mark
     that refers to dolphins, porpoises, or marine mammals other than the
     mark developed under subparagraph (A) unless--

     (i) no dolphins were killed or seriously injured in the sets or
     other gear deployments in which the tuna were caught;

     (ii) the label is supported by a tracking and verification program
     which is comparable in effectiveness to the program established
     under subsection (f); and

     (iii) the label complies with all applicable labeling, marketing,

     serious injury; and

     (D) the rate, based on the appropriate standard unit of fishing
     effort, of such incidental mortality and serious injury, and an
     analysis stating whether such level is insignificant and is
     approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate;

     (5) categorize the status of the stock as one that either—

     (A) has a level of human-caused mortality and serious injury that is
     not likely to cause the stock to be reduced below its optimum
     sustainable population; or

     (B) is a strategic stock, with a description of the reasons
     therefor; and

     (6) estimate the potential biological removal level for the stock,
     describing the information used to calculate it, including the
     recovery factor.

   (b) PUBLIC COMMENT. —

     (1) The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of
     the availability of a draft stock assessment or any revision thereof
     and provide an opportunity for public review and comment during a
     period of 90 days. Such notice shall include a summary of the

     or any revision thereof, not later than 90 days after—

     (A) the close of the public comment period on a draft stock
     assessment or revision thereof; or

     (B) final action on an agency proceeding pursuant to paragraph (2).

   (c) REVIEW AND REVISION. —

     (1) The Secretary shall review stock assessments in accordance with
     this subsection—

     (A) at least annually for stocks which are specified as strategic
     stocks;

     (B) at least annually for stocks for which significant new
     information is available; and

     (C) at least once every 3 years for all other stocks.

     (2) If the review under paragraph (1) indicates that the status of
     the stock has changed or can be more accurately determined, the
     Secretary shall revise the stock assessment in accordance with
     subsection (b).

   (d) REGIONAL SCIENTIFIC REVIEW GROUPS. —

     (1) Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this

     marine mammals under that Secretary's jurisdiction), the Marine
     Mammal Commission, the Governors of affected adjacent coastal
     States, regional fishery and wildlife management authorities, Alaska
     Native organizations and Indian tribes, and environmental and
     fishery groups, establish three independent regional scientific
     review groups representing Alaska, the Pacific Coast (including
     Hawaii), and the Atlantic Coast (including the Gulf of Mexico),
     consisting of individuals with expertise in marine mammal biology
     and ecology, population dynamics and modeling, commercial fishing
     technology and practices, and stocks taken under section 101(b). The
     Secretary of Commerce shall, to the maximum extent practicable,
     attempt to achieve a balanced representation of viewpoints among the
     individuals on each regional scientific review group. The regional
     scientific review groups shall advise the Secretary on—

     (A) population estimates and the population status and trends of
     such stocks;

     (B) uncertainties and research needed regarding stock separation,
     abundance, or trends, and factors affecting the distribution, size,
     or productivity of the stock;

     (C) uncertainties and research needed regarding the species, number,
     ages, gender, and reproductive status of marine mammals;

     (D) research needed to identify modifications in fishing gear and
     practices likely to reduce the incidental mortality and serious
     injury of marine mammals in commercial fishing operations;

     (E) the actual, expected, or potential impacts of habitat
     destruction, including marine pollution and natural environmental
     change, on specific marine mammal species or stocks, and for
     strategic stocks, appropriate conservation or management measures to
     alleviate any such impacts; and

     (F) any other issue which the Secretary or the groups consider
     appropriate.

     (2) The scientific review groups established under this subsection
     shall not be subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 App.
     U. S.C.).

     (3) Members of the scientific review groups shall serve without
     compensation, but may be reimbursed by the Secretary, upon request,
     for reasonable travel costs and expenses incurred in performing
     their obligations.

     (4) The Secretary may appoint or reappoint individuals to the
     regional scientific review groups under paragraph (1) as needed.

   (e) EFFECT ON SECTION 101(b). — This section shall not affect or
   otherwise modify the provisions of section 101(b).

Section 118. Taking of Marine Mammals Incidental to Commercial Fishing
Operations

16 U.S.C. 1387 Sec. 118.

   (a) IN GENERAL. —

     (1) Effective on the date of enactment of this section [April 30,
     1994], and except as provided in section 114 and in paragraphs (2),
     (3), and (4) of this subsection, the provisions of this section
     shall govern the incidental taking of marine mammals in the course
     of commercial fishing operations by persons using vessels of the
     United States or vessels which have valid fishing permits issued by
     the Secretary in accordance with section 204(b) of the
     Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U. S.C.
     1824(b)). In any event it shall be the immediate goal that the
     incidental mortality or serious injury of marine mammals occurring
     in the course of commercial fishing operations be reduced to
     insignificant levels approaching a zero mortality and serious injury
     rate within 7 years after the date of enactment of this section
     [April 30, 2001].

     (2) In the case of the incidental taking of marine mammals from
     species or stocks designated under this Act as depleted on the basis
     of their listing as threatened species or endangered species under
     the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U. S.C. 1531 et seq.), both
     this section and section 101(a)(5)(E) of this Act shall apply.

     (3) Sections 104(h) and title III, and not this section, shall
     govern the taking of marine mammals in the course of commercial
     purse seine fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical
     Pacific Ocean.

     (4) This section shall not govern the incidental taking of
     California sea otters and shall not be deemed to amend or repeal the
     Act of November 7, 1986 (Public Law 99-625; 100 Stat. 3500).

     (5) Except as provided in section 101(c), the intentional lethal
     take of any marine mammal in the course of commercial fishing
     operations is prohibited.

     (6) Sections 103 and 104 shall not apply to the incidental taking of
     marine mammals under the authority of this section.

   (b) ZERO MORTALITY RATE GOAL. —

     (1) Commercial fisheries shall reduce incidental mortality and
     serious injury of marine mammals to insignificant levels approaching
     a zero mortality and serious injury rate within 7 years after the
     date of enactment of this section [April 30, 2001].

     (2) Fisheries which maintain insignificant serious injury and
     mortality levels approaching a zero rate shall not be required to
     further reduce their mortality and serious injury rates.

     (3) Three years after such date of enactment [April 30, 1997], the
     Secretary shall review the progress of all commercial fisheries, by
     fishery, toward reducing incidental mortality and serious injury to
     insignificant levels approaching a zero rate. The Secretary shall
     submit to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of
     the Senate and the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the
     House of Representatives a report setting forth the results of such
     review within 1 year after commencement of the review. The Secretary
     shall note any commercial fishery for which additional information
     is required to accurately assess the level of incidental mortality
     and serious injury of marine mammals in the fishery.

     (4) If the Secretary determines after review under paragraph (3)
     that the rate of incidental mortality and serious injury of marine
     mammals in a commercial fishery is not consistent with paragraph
     (1), then the Secretary shall take appropriate action under
     subsection (f).

   (c) REGISTRATION AND AUTHORIZATION. —

     (1) The Secretary shall, within 90 days after the date of enactment
     of this section [July 29, 1994]—

     (A) publish in the Federal Register for public comment, for a period
     of not less than 90 days, any necessary changes to the Secretary's
     list of commercial fisheries published under section 114(b)(1) and
     which is in existence on March 31, 1994 (along with an explanation
     of such changes and a statement describing the marine mammal stocks
     interacting with, and the approximate number of vessels or persons
     actively involved in, each such fishery), with respect to commercial
     fisheries that have—

     in the Federal Register a revised list of commercial fisheries and
     an update of information required by subparagraph (A), together with
     a summary of the provisions of this section and information
     sufficient to advise vessel owners on how to obtain an authorization
     and otherwise comply with the requirements of this section; and

     (C) at least once each year thereafter, and at such other times as
     the Secretary considers appropriate, reexamine, based on information
     gathered under this Act and other relevant sources and after notice
     and opportunity for public comment, the classification of commercial
     fisheries and other determinations required under subparagraph (A)
     and publish in the Federal Register any necessary changes.

     (2)

     (A) An authorization shall be granted by the Secretary in accordance
     with this section for a vessel engaged in a commercial fishery
     listed under paragraph (1)(A) (i) or (ii), upon receipt by the
     Secretary of a completed registration form providing the name of the
     vessel owner and operator, the name and description of the vessel,
     the fisheries in which it will be engaged, the approximate time,
     duration, and location of such fishery operations, and the general
     type and nature of use of the fishing gear and techniques used. Such
     information shall be in a readily usable format that can be
     efficiently entered into and utilized by an automated or
     computerized data processing system. A decal or other physical
     evidence that the authorization is current and valid shall be issued
     by the Secretary at the time an authorization is granted, and so
     long as the authorization remains current and valid, shall be
     reissued annually thereafter.

     incidental taking of marine mammals in a commercial fishery—

     (i) have registered as required under paragraph (2) with the
     Secretary in order to obtain for each such vessel owned and used in
     the fishery an authorization for the purpose of incidentally taking
     marine mammals in accordance with this section, except that owners
     of vessels holding valid certificates of exemption under section 114
     are deemed to have registered for purposes of this subsection for
     the period during which such exemption is valid;

     (ii) ensure that a decal or such other physical evidence of a
     current and valid authorization as the Secretary may require is
     displayed on or is in the possession of the master of each such
     vessel;

     (iii) report as required by subsection (e); and

     (iv) comply with any applicable take reduction plan and emergency
     regulations issued under this section.

     (B) Any owner of a vessel receiving an authorization under this
     section for any fishery listed under paragraph (1)(A) (i) or (ii)
     shall, as a condition of that authorization, take on board an
     observer if requested to do so by the Secretary.

     (C) An owner of a vessel engaged in a fishery listed under paragraph
     (1)(A) (i) or (ii) who—

     (i) fails to obtain from the Secretary an authorization for such
     vessel under this section;

     this title, and for violations of clauses (i) and (ii) shall be
     subject to the penalties of this title, and for violations of clause
     (iii) shall be subject to a fine of not more than $100 for each
     offense.

     (D) If the owner of a vessel has obtained and maintains a current
     and valid authorization from the Secretary under this section and
     meets the requirements set forth in this section, including
     compliance with any regulations to implement a take reduction plan
     under this section, the owner of such vessel, and the master and
     crew members of the vessel, shall not be subject to the penalties
     set forth in this title for the incidental taking of marine mammals
     while such vessel is engaged in a fishery to which the authorization
     applies.

     (E) Each owner of a vessel engaged in any fishery not listed under
     paragraph (1)(A) (i) or (ii), and the master and crew members of
     such a vessel, shall not be subject to the penalties set forth in
     this title for the incidental taking of marine mammals if such owner
     reports to the Secretary, in the form and manner required under
     subsection (e), instances of incidental mortality or injury of

     evidence of the authorization for any vessel until the owner of such
     vessel complies with the reporting requirements under subsection (e)
     and such requirements to take on board an observer under paragraph
     (3)(B) as are applicable to such vessel. Previous failure to comply
     with the requirements of section 114 shall not bar authorization
     under this section for an owner who complies with the requirements
     of this section.

     (B) The Secretary may suspend or revoke an authorization granted
     under this subsection, and may not issue a decal or other physical
     evidence of the authorization for any vessel which fails to comply
     with a take reduction plan or emergency regulations issued under
     this section.

     (C) The owner and master of a vessel which fails to comply with a
     take reduction plan shall be subject to the penalties of sections
     105 and 107, and may be subject to section 106.

     (5)

     (A) The Secretary shall develop, in consultation with the
     appropriate States, affected Regional Fishery Management Councils,
     and other interested persons, the means by which the granting and
     administration of authorizations under this section shall be
     integrated and coordinated, to the maximum extent practicable, with
     existing fishery licenses, registrations, and related programs.

     (B) The Secretary shall utilize newspapers of general circulation,
     fishery trade associations, electronic media, and other means of
     advising commercial fishermen of the provisions of this section and
     the means by which they can comply with its requirements.

     (C) The Secretary is authorized to charge a fee for the granting of
     an authorization under this section. The level of fees charged under
     this subparagraph shall not exceed the administrative costs incurred
     in granting an authorization. Fees collected under this subparagraph
     shall be available to the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and
     Atmosphere for expenses incurred in the granting and administration
     of authorizations under this section.

   (d) MONITORING OF INCIDENTAL TAKES. —

     (1) The Secretary shall establish a program to monitor incidental
     mortality and serious injury of marine mammals during the course of
     commercial fishing operations. The purposes of the monitoring
     program shall be to—

     (A) obtain statistically reliable estimates of incidental mortality
     and serious injury;

     (B) determine the reliability of reports of incidental mortality and
     serious injury under subsection (e); and

     (C) identify changes in fishing methods or technology that may
     increase or decrease incidental mortality and serious injury.

     (2) Pursuant to paragraph (1), the Secretary may place observers on
     board vessels as necessary, subject to the provisions of this
     section. Observers may, among other tasks—

     (A) record incidental mortality and injury, or by catch of other
     nontarget species;

     (B) record numbers of marine mammals sighted; and

     (C) perform other scientific investigations.

     (3) In determining the distribution of observers among commercial
     fisheries and vessels within a fishery, the Secretary shall be
     guided by the following standards:

     (A) The requirement to obtain statistically reliable information.

     (B) The requirement that assignment of observers is fair and
     equitable among fisheries and among vessels in a fishery.

     (C) The requirement that no individual person or vessel, or group of
     persons or vessels, be subject to excessive or overly burdensome
     observer coverage.

     (D) To the extent practicable, the need to minimize costs and avoid
     duplication.

     (4) To the extent practicable, the Secretary shall allocate
     observers among commercial fisheries in accordance with the
     following priority:

     (A) The highest priority for allocation shall be for commercial
     fisheries that have incidental mortality or serious injury of marine
     mammals from stocks listed as endangered species or threatened
     species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U. S.C. 1531 et
     seq.).

     (B) The second highest priority for allocation shall be for
     commercial fisheries that have incidental mortality and serious
     injury of marine mammals from strategic stocks.

     (C) The third highest priority for allocation shall be for
     commercial fisheries that have incidental mortality or serious
     injury of marine mammals from stocks for which the level of
     incidental mortality and serious injury is uncertain.

     (5) The Secretary may establish an alternative observer program to
     provide statistically reliable information on the species and number
     of marine mammals incidentally taken in the course of commercial
     fishing operations. The alternative observer program may include
     direct observation of fishing activities from vessels, airplanes, or
     points on shore.

     (6) The Secretary is not required to place an observer on a vessel
     in a fishery if the Secretary finds that—

     (A) in a situation in which harvesting vessels are delivering fish
     to a processing vessel and the catch is not taken on board the
     harvesting vessel, statistically reliable information can be
     obtained from an observer on board the processing vessel to which
     the fish are delivered;

     (B) the facilities on a vessel for quartering of an observer, or for
     carrying out observer functions, are so inadequate or unsafe that
     the health or safety of the observer or the safe operation of the
     vessel would be jeopardized; or

     (C) for reasons beyond the control of the Secretary, an observer is
     not available.

     (7) The Secretary may, with the consent of the vessel owner, station
     an observer on board a vessel engaged in a fishery not listed under
     subsection (c)(1)(A) (i) or (ii).

     (8) Any proprietary information collected under this subsection
     shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed except—

     (A) to Federal employees whose duties require access to such
     information;

     (B) to State or tribal employees pursuant to an agreement with the
     Secretary that prevents public disclosure of the identity or
     business of any person;

     (C) when required by court order; or

     (D) in the case of scientific information involving fisheries, to
     employees of Regional Fishery Management Councils who are
     responsible for fishery management plan development and monitoring.

     (9) The Secretary shall prescribe such procedures as may be
     necessary to preserve such confidentiality, except that the
     Secretary shall release or make public upon request any such
     information in aggregate, summary, or other form which does not
     directly or indirectly disclose the identity or business of any
     person.

   (e) REPORTING REQUIREMENT. — The owner or operator of a commercial
   fishing vessel subject to this Act shall report all incidental
   mortality and injury of marine mammals in the course of commercial
   fishing operations to the Secretary by mail or other means acceptable
   to the Secretary within 48 hours after the end of each fishing trip on
   a standard postage paid form to be developed by the Secretary under
   this section. Such form shall be capable of being readily entered into
   and usable by an automated or computerized data processing system and
   shall require the vessel owner or operator to provide the following:

     (1) The vessel name, and Federal, State, or tribal registration
     numbers of the registered vessel.

     (2) The name and address of the vessel owner or operator.

     (3) The name and description of the fishery.

     (4) The species of each marine mammal incidentally killed or
     injured, and the date, time, and approximate geographic location of
     such occurrence.

   (f) TAKE REDUCTION PLANS. —

     (1) The Secretary shall develop and implement a take reduction plan
     designed to assist in the recovery or prevent the depletion of each
     strategic stock which interacts with a commercial fishery listed
     under subsection (c)(1)(A) (i) or (ii), and may develop and
     implement such a plan for any other marine mammal stocks which
     interact with a commercial fishery listed under subsection
     (c)(1)(A)(i) which the Secretary determines, after notice and
     opportunity for public comment, has a high level of mortality and
     serious injury across a number of such marine mammal stocks.

     (2) The immediate goal of a take reduction plan for a strategic
     stock shall be to reduce, within 6 months of its implementation, the
     incidental mortality or serious injury of marine mammals
     incidentally taken in the course of commercial fishing operations to
     levels less than the potential biological removal level established
     for that stock under section 117. The long-term goal of the plan
     shall be to reduce, within 5 years of its implementation, the
     incidental mortality or serious injury of marine mammals
     incidentally taken in the course of commercial fishing operations to
     insignificant levels approaching a zero mortality and serious injury
     rate, taking into account the economics of the fishery, the
     availability of existing technology, and existing State or regional
     fishery management plans.

     (3) If there is insufficient funding available to develop and
     implement a take reduction plan for all such stocks that interact
     with commercial fisheries listed under subsection (c)(1)(A) (i) or
     (ii), the Secretary shall give highest priority to the development
     and implementation of take reduction plans for species or stocks
     whose level of incidental mortality and serious injury exceeds the
     potential biological removal level, those that have a small
     population size, and those which are declining most rapidly.

     (4) Each take reduction plan shall include—

     (A) a review of the information in the final stock assessment
     published under section 117(b) and any substantial new information;

     (B) an estimate of the total number and, if possible, age and
     gender, of animals from the stock that are being incidentally
     lethally taken or seriously injured each year during the course of
     commercial fishing operations, by fishery;

     (C) recommended regulatory or voluntary measures for the reduction
     of incidental mortality and serious injury;

     (D) recommended dates for achieving the specific objectives of the
     plan.

     (5)

     (A) For any stock in which incidental mortality and serious injury
     from commercial fisheries exceeds the potential biological removal
     level established under section 117, the plan shall include measures
     the Secretary expects will reduce, within 6 months of the plan's
     implementation, such mortality and serious injury to a level below
     the potential biological removal level.

     (B) For any stock in which human-caused mortality and serious injury
     exceeds the potential biological removal level, other than a stock
     to which subparagraph (A) applies, the plan shall include measures
     the Secretary expects will reduce, to the maximum extent practicable
     within 6 months of the plan's implementation, the incidental
     mortality and serious injury by such commercial fisheries from that
     stock. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "maximum extent
     practicable" means to the lowest level that is feasible for such
     fisheries within the 6-month period.

     (6)

     (A) At the earliest possible time (not later than 30 days) after the
     Secretary issues a final stock assessment under section 117(b) for a
     strategic stock, the Secretary shall, and for stocks that interact
     with a fishery listed under subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) for which the
     Secretary has made a determination under paragraph (1), the
     Secretary may—

     (i) establish a take reduction team for such stock and appoint the
     members of such team in accordance with subparagraph (C); and

     (ii) publish in the Federal Register a notice of the team's
     establishment, the names of the team's appointed members, the full
     geographic range of such stock, and a list of all commercial
     fisheries that cause incidental mortality and serious injury of
     marine mammals from such stock.

     (B) The Secretary may request a take reduction team to address a
     stock that extends over one or more regions or fisheries, or
     multiple stocks within a region or fishery, if the Secretary
     determines that doing so would facilitate the development and
     implementation of plans required under this subsection.

     (C) Members of take reduction teams shall have expertise regarding
     the conservation or biology of the marine mammal species which the
     take reduction plan will address, or the fishing practices which
     result in the incidental mortality and serious injury of such
     species. Members shall include representatives of Federal agencies,
     each coastal State which has fisheries which interact with the
     species or stock, appropriate Regional Fishery Management Councils,
     interstate fisheries commissions, academic and scientific
     organizations, environmental groups, all commercial and recreational
     fisheries groups and gear types which incidentally take the species
     or stock, Alaska Native organizations or Indian tribal
     organizations, and others as the Secretary deems appropriate. Take
     reduction teams shall, to the maximum extent practicable, consist of
     an equitable balance among representatives of resource user
     interests and nonuser interests.

     (D) Take reduction teams shall not be subject to the Federal
     Advisory Committee Act (5 App. U.S.C.). Meetings of take reduction
     teams shall be open to the public, and prior notice of meetings
     shall be made public in a timely fashion.

     (E) Members of take reduction teams shall serve without
     compensation, but may be reimbursed by the Secretary, upon request,
     for reasonable travel costs and expenses incurred in performing
     their duties as members of the team.

     (7) Where the human-caused mortality and serious injury from a
     strategic stock is estimated to be equal to or greater than the
     potential biological removal level established under section 117 for
     such stock and such stock interacts with a fishery listed under
     subsection (c)(1)(A) (i) or (ii), the following procedures shall
     apply in the development of the take reduction plan for the stock:

     (A)

     (i) Not later than 6 months after the date of establishment of a
     take reduction team for the stock, the team shall submit a draft
     take reduction plan for such stock to the Secretary, consistent with
     the other provisions of this section.

     (ii) Such draft take reduction plan shall be developed by consensus.
     In the event consensus cannot be reached, the team shall advise the
     Secretary in writing on the range of possibilities considered by the
     team, and the views of both the majority and minority.

     (B)

     (i) The Secretary shall take the draft take reduction plan into
     consideration and, not later than 60 days after the submission of
     the draft plan by the team, the Secretary shall publish in the
     Federal Register the plan proposed by the team, any changes proposed
     by the Secretary with an explanation of the reasons therefor, and
     proposed regulations to implement such plan, for public review and
     comment during a period of not to exceed 90 days.

     (ii) In the event that the take reduction team does not submit a
     draft plan to the Secretary within 6 months, the Secretary shall,
     not later than 8 months after the establishment of the team, publish
     in the Federal Register a proposed take reduction plan and
     implementing regulations, for public review and comment during a
     period of not to exceed 90 days.

     (C) Not later than 60 days after the close of the comment period
     required under subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall issue a final
     take reduction plan and implementing regulations, consistent with
     the other provisions of this section.

     (D) The Secretary shall, during a period of 30 days after
     publication of a final take reduction plan, utilize newspapers of
     general circulation, fishery trade associations, electronic media,
     and other means of advising commercial fishermen of the requirements
     of the plan and how to comply with them.

     (E) The Secretary and the take reduction team shall meet every 6
     months, or at such other intervals as the Secretary determines are
     necessary, to monitor the implementation of the final take reduction
     plan until such time that the Secretary determines that the
     objectives of such plan have been met.

     (F) The Secretary shall amend the take reduction plan and
     implementing regulations as necessary to meet the requirements of
     this section, in accordance with the procedures in this section for
     the issuance of such plans and regulations.

     (8) Where the human-caused mortality and serious injury from a
     strategic stock is estimated to be less than the potential
     biological removal level established under section 117 for such
     stock and such stock interacts with a fishery listed under
     subsection (c)(1)(A) (i) or (ii), or for any marine mammal stocks
     which interact with a commercial fishery listed under subsection
     (c)(1)(A)(i) for which the Secretary has made a determination under
     paragraph (1), the following procedures shall apply in the
     development of the take reduction plan for such stock:

     (A)

     (i) Not later than 11 months after the date of establishment of a
     take reduction team for the stock, the team shall submit a draft
     take reduction plan for the stock to the Secretary, consistent with
     the other provisions of this section.

     (ii) Such draft take reduction plan shall be developed by consensus.
     In the event consensus cannot be reached, the team shall advise the
     Secretary in writing on the range of possibilities considered by the
     team, and the views of both the majority and minority.

     (B)

     (i) The Secretary shall take the draft take reduction plan into
     consideration and, not later than 60 days after the submission of
     the draft plan by the team, the Secretary shall publish in the
     Federal Register the plan proposed by the team, any changes proposed
     by the Secretary with an explanation of the reasons therefor, and
     proposed regulations to implement such plan, for public review and
     comment during a period of not to exceed 90 days.

     (ii) In the event that the take reduction team does not submit a
     draft plan to the Secretary within 11 months, the Secretary shall,
     not later than 13 months after the establishment of the team,
     publish in the Federal Register a proposed take reduction plan and
     implementing regulations, for public review and comment during a
     period of not to exceed 90 days.

     (C) Not later than 60 days after the close of the comment period
     required under subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall issue a final
     take reduction plan and implementing regulations, consistent with
     the other provisions of this section.

     (D) The Secretary shall, during a period of 30 days after
     publication of a final take reduction plan, utilize newspapers of
     general circulation, fishery trade associations, electronic media,
     and other means of advising commercial fishermen of the requirements
     of the plan and how to comply with them.

     (E) The Secretary and the take reduction team shall meet on an
     annual basis, or at such other intervals as the Secretary determines
     are necessary, to monitor the implementation of the final take
     reduction plan until such time that the Secretary determines that
     the objectives of such plan have been met.

     (F) The Secretary shall amend the take reduction plan and
     implementing regulations as necessary to meet the requirements of
     this section, in accordance with the procedures in this section for
     the issuance of such plans and regulations.

     (9) In implementing a take reduction plan developed pursuant to this
     subsection, the Secretary may, where necessary to implement a take
     reduction plan to protect or restore a marine mammal stock or
     species covered by such plan, promulgate regulations which include,
     but are not limited to, measures to—

     (A) establish fishery-specific limits on incidental mortality and
     serious injury of marine mammals in commercial fisheries or restrict
     commercial fisheries by time or area;

     (B) require the use of alternative commercial fishing gear or
     techniques and new technologies, encourage the development of such
     gear or technology, or convene expert skippers'panels;

     (C) educate commercial fishermen, through workshops and other means,
     on the importance of reducing the incidental mortality and serious
     injury of marine mammals in affected commercial fisheries; and

     (D) monitor, in accordance with subsection (d), the effectiveness of
     measures taken to reduce the level of incidental mortality and
     serious injury of marine mammals in the course of commercial fishing
     operations.

     (10)

     (A) Notwithstanding paragraph (6), in the case of any stock to which
     paragraph (1) applies for which a final stock assessment has not
     been published under section 117(b)(3) by April 1, 1995, due to a
     proceeding under section 117(b)(2), or any Federal court review of
     such proceeding, the Secretary shall establish a take reduction team
     under paragraph (6) for such stock as if a final stock assessment
     had been published.

     (B) The draft stock assessment published for such stock under
     section 117(b)(1) shall be deemed the final stock assessment for
     purposes of preparing and implementing a take reduction plan for
     such stock under this section.

     (C) Upon publication of a final stock assessment for such stock
     under section 117(b)(3) the Secretary shall immediately reconvene
     the take reduction team for such stock for the purpose of amending
     the take reduction plan, and any regulations issued to implement
     such plan, if necessary, to reflect the final stock assessment or
     court action. Such amendments shall be made in accordance with
     paragraph (7)(F) or (8)(F), as appropriate.

     (D) A draft stock assessment may only be used as the basis for a
     take reduction plan under this paragraph for a period of not to
     exceed two years, or until a final stock assessment is published,
     whichever is earlier. If, at the end of the two-year period, a final
     stock assessment has not been published, the Secretary shall
     categorize such stock under section 117(a)(5)(A) and shall revoke
     any regulations to implement a take reduction plan for such stock.

     (E) Subparagraph (D) shall not apply for any period beyond two years
     during which a final stock assessment for such stock has not been
     published due to review of a proceeding on such stock assessment by
     a Federal court. Immediately upon final action by such court, the
     Secretary shall proceed under subparagraph (C).

     (11) Take reduction plans developed under this section for a species
     or stock listed as a threatened species or endangered species under
     the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) shall be
     consistent with any recovery plan developed for such species or
     stock under section 4 of such Act.

   (g) EMERGENCY REGULATIONS. —

     (1) If the Secretary finds that the incidental mortality and serious
     injury of marine mammals from commercial fisheries is having, or is
     likely to have, an immediate and significant adverse impact on a
     stock or species, the Secretary shall take actions as follows:

     (A) In the case of a stock or species for which a take reduction
     plan is in effect, the Secretary shall—

     (i) prescribe emergency regulations that, consistent with such plan
     to the maximum extent practicable, reduce incidental mortality and
     serious injury in that fishery; and

     (ii) approve and implement, on an expedited basis, any amendments to
     such plan that are recommended by the take reduction team to address
     such adverse impact.

     (B) In the case of a stock or species for which a take reduction
     plan is being developed, the Secretary shall—

     (i) prescribe emergency regulations to reduce such incidental
     mortality and serious injury in that fishery; and

     (ii) approve and implement, on an expedited basis, such plan, which
     shall provide methods to address such adverse impact if still
     necessary.

     (C) In the case of a stock or species for which a take reduction
     plan does not exist and is not being developed, or in the case of a
     commercial fishery listed under subsection (c)(1)(A)(iii) which the
     Secretary believes may be contributing to such adverse impact, the
     Secretary shall—

     (i) prescribe emergency regulations to reduce such incidental
     mortality and serious injury in that fishery, to the extent
     necessary to mitigate such adverse impact;

     (ii) immediately review the stock assessment for such stock or
     species and the classification of such commercial fishery under this
     section to determine if a take reduction team should be established;
     and

     (iii) may, where necessary to address such adverse impact on a
     species or stock listed as a threatened species or endangered
     species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et
     seq.), place observers on vessels in a commercial fishery listed
     under subsection (c)(1)(A)(iii), if the Secretary has reason to
     believe such vessels may be causing the incidental mortality and
     serious injury to marine mammals from such stock.

     (2) Prior to taking action under paragraph (1) (A), (B), or (C), the
     Secretary shall consult with the Marine Mammal Commission, all
     appropriate Regional Fishery Management Councils, State fishery
     managers, and the appropriate take reduction team (if established).

     (3) Emergency regulations prescribed under this subsection—

     (A) shall be published in the Federal Register, together with an
     explanation thereof;

     (B) shall remain in effect for not more than 180 days or until the
     end of the applicable commercial fishing season, whichever is
     earlier; and

     (C) may be terminated by the Secretary at an earlier date by
     publication in the Federal Register of a notice of termination, if
     the Secretary determines that the reasons for emergency regulations
     no longer exist.

     (4) If the Secretary finds that incidental mortality and serious
     injury of marine mammals in a commercial fishery is continuing to
     have an immediate and significant adverse impact on a stock or
     species, the Secretary may extend the emergency regulations for an
     additional period of not more than 90 days or until reasons for the
     emergency no longer exist, whichever is earlier.

   (h) PENALTIES. — Except as provided in subsection (c), any person who
   violates this section shall be subject to the provisions of sections
   105 and 107, and may be subject to section 106 as the Secretary shall
   establish by regulations.

   (i) ASSISTANCE. — The Secretary shall provide assistance to Regional
   Fishery Management Councils, States, interstate fishery commissions,
   and Indian tribal organizations in meeting the goal of reducing
   incidental mortality and serious injury to insignificant levels
   approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate.

   (j) CONTRIBUTIONS. — For purposes of carrying out this section, the
   Secretary may accept, solicit, receive, hold, administer, and use
   gifts, devises, and bequests.

   (k) CONSULTATION WITH SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR. — The Secretary shall
   consult with the Secretary of the Interior prior to taking actions or
   making determinations under this section that affect or relate to
   species or population stocks of marine mammals for which the Secretary
   of the Interior is responsible under this title.

   (l) DEFINITIONS. — As used in this section and section 101(a)(5)(E),
   each of the terms "fishery" and "vessel of the United States" has the
   same meaning it does in section 3 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery
   Conservation and Management Act (16 U. S.C. 1802).

Section 119. Marine Mammal Cooperative Agreements in Alaska

16 U.S.C. 1388 Sec. 119.

     comments in response to the Federal Register notice under paragraph
     (1), the Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force shall—

     (A) recommend to the Secretary whether to approve or deny the
     proposed intentional lethal taking of the pinniped or pinnipeds,
     including along with the recommendation a description of the
     specific pinniped individual or individuals, the proposed location,
     time, and method of such taking, criteria for evaluating the success
     of the action, and the duration of the intentional lethal taking
     authority; and

     (B) suggest nonlethal alternatives, if available and practicable,
     including a recommended course of action.

     (4) Within 30 days after receipt of recommendations from the
     Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force, the Secretary shall either
     approve or deny the application. If such application is approved,
     the Secretary shall immediately take steps to implement the
     intentional lethal taking, which shall be performed by Federal or
     State agencies, or qualified individuals under contract to such
     agencies.

     (5) After implementation of an approved application, the
     Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force shall evaluate the
     effectiveness of the permitted intentional lethal taking or
     alternative actions implemented. If implementation was ineffective
     in eliminating the problem interaction, the Task Force shall
     recommend additional actions. If the implementation was effective,
     the Task Force shall so advise the Secretary, and the Secretary
     shall disband the Task Force.

   (d) CONSIDERATIONS. — In considering whether an application should be
   approved or denied, the Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force and the
   Secretary shall consider—

     interaction, how and when the interaction occurs, and how many
     individual pinnipeds are involved;

     (2) past efforts to nonlethally deter such pinnipeds, and whether
     the applicant has demonstrated that no feasible and prudent
     alternatives exist and that the applicant has taken all reasonable
     nonlethal steps without success;

     (3) the extent to which such pinnipeds are causing undue injury or
     impact to, or imbalance with, other species in the ecosystem,
     including fish populations; and

     (4) the extent to which such pinnipeds are exhibiting behavior that
     presents an ongoing threat to public safety.

   (e) LIMITATION. — The Secretary shall not approve the intentional
   lethal taking of any pinniped from a species or stock that is—

     (1) listed as a threatened species or endangered species under the

Title III - International Dolphin Conservation Program

Section 301. Findings and Policy

16 U.S.C. 1411 Sec. 301.

   (a) FINDINGS. — The Congress finds the following:

     (1) The yellowfin tuna fishery of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean
     has resulted in the deaths of millions of dolphins.

     (2) Significant awareness and increased concern for the health and
     safety of dolphin populations has encouraged a change in fishing
     methods worldwide.

     (3) United States tuna fishing vessels have led the world in the
     development of fishing methods to reduce dolphin mortalities in the
     eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and United States tuna processing
     companies have voluntarily promoted the marketing of tuna that is
     dolphin safe.

     (4) Nations harvesting yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical
     Pacific Ocean have demonstrated their willingness to participate in
     appropriate multilateral agreements to reduce dolphin mortality
     progressively to a level approaching zero through the setting of
     annual limits, with the goal of eliminating dolphin mortality in
     that fishery. Recognition of the International Dolphin Conservation
     Program will assure that the existing trend of reduced dolphin
     mortality continues, that individual stocks of dolphins are
     adequately protected; and that the goal of eliminating all dolphin
     mortality continues to be a priority.

   (b) POLICY. — It is the policy of the United States to—

     (1) eliminate the marine mammal mortality resulting from the
     intentional encirclement of dolphins and other marine mammals in
     tuna purse seine fisheries;

     (2) support the International Dolphin Conservation Program and
     efforts within the Program to reduce, with the goal of eliminating,
     the mortality referred to in paragraph (1);

     (3) ensure that the market of the United States does not act as an
     incentive to the harvest of tuna caught with driftnets or caught by
     purse seine vessels in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean not
     operating in compliance with the International Dolphin Conservation
     Program;

     (4) secure appropriate multilateral agreements to ensure that United
     States tuna fishing vessels shall have continued access to
     productive tuna fishing grounds in the South Pacific Ocean and
     elsewhere; and

     (5) encourage observer coverage on purse seine vessels fishing for
     tuna outside of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean in a fishery in
     which the Secretary has determined that a regular and significant
     association occurs between marine mammals and tuna, and in which
     tuna is harvested through the use of purse seine nets deployed on or
     to encircle marine mammals.

Section 302. International Dolphin Conservation Program

16 U.S.C. 1412 Sec. 302.

   The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary, shall seek
   to secure a binding international agreement to establish an
   International Dolphin Conservation Program that requires–

   (1) that the total annual dolphin mortality in the purse seine fishery
   for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean shall not
   exceed 5,000 animals with a commitment and objective to progressively
   reduce dolphin mortality to a level approaching zero through the
   setting of annual limits;

   (2) the establishment of a per-stock per-year dolphin mortality limit,
   to be in effect through calendar year 2000, at a level between 0.2
   percent and 0.1 percent of the minimum population estimate, as
   calculated, revised, or approved by the Secretary;

   (3) the establishment of a per-stock per-year dolphin mortality limit,
   beginning with the calendar year 2001, at a level less than or equal to
   0.1 percent of the minimum population estimate as calculated, revised,
   or approved by the Secretary;

   (4) that if a dolphin mortality limit is exceeded under--

     (A) paragraph (1), all sets on dolphins shall cease for the
     applicable fishing year; and

     (B) paragraph (2) or (3), all sets on the stocks covered under
     paragraph (2) or (3) and any mixed schools that contain any of those
     stocks shall cease for the applicable fishing year;

2017 Alaska Fisheries Science Center Year in Review

   Protecting Marine Mammals
   Alaska
   Year in Review Protecting Marine Mammals

Protecting Marine Mammals

   Our marine mammal research involves collecting information that agency
   managers and other constituents need to make informed management
   decisions to comply with the Endangered Species Act, the Marine Mammal
   Protection Act and other relevant statutes to protect whales, seals,
   porpoises and sea lions in Alaska. Some marine mammal populations are a
   primary food source for Alaska Native communities and we provide
   science expertise to Alaska Native Commissions responsible for
   co-managing these harvests with NOAA Fisheries. With support from the
   Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management we have been able to conduct a
   multi-disciplinary survey of the Bering and Chukchi seas that involved
   passive acoustic monitoring, biological and physical oceanographic
   sampling, and aerial and shipboard visual surveys for marine mammals
   and seabirds. Data collected through this research informs population
   assessments for a wide variety of species and is used by NOAA managers
   and by other management bodies (notably the International Whaling
   Commission).

New Research Projects to Study Cook Inlet Beluga Whales Implemented

   As part of the NOAA Fisheries Species in the Spotlight initiative, we
   began several new studies on the endangered Cook Inlet beluga whale
   population, including genetic research and use of hexacopters to
   photograph the whales. Through the hexacopter project, conducted in
   collaboration with the Southwest Fisheries Science Center and the
   Alaska Department of Fish and Game, scientists hope to monitor calf
   production and learn more about whale injuries and disease, which is
   important for conservation and recovery efforts. This work complements
   ongoing acoustic studies by NOAA Fisheries affiliates to learn more
   about beluga whale hearing and the impact of human-generated sound on
   this endangered species.

International Collaboration to Gather Needed Data on Rarest Whale Population
in U.S. Waters

   We participated in an International Whaling Commission survey of whales
   in the Bering Sea. We used passive acoustic monitoring (e.g.,
   sonobuoys) for the first time on this survey to locate and collect
   critically needed genetic information on two eastern North Pacific
   right whales. This is the world’s smallest whale population, with an
   estimated 30 animals remaining.

Harbor Seal Surveys

   We conducted extensive surveys of harbor seals in southcentral and
   western Alaska, including Cook Inlet, Iliamna Lake, Kodiak Archipelago,
   Bristol Bay, and the eastern Aleutians. Many areas were surveyed in
   both June and August to study the transition from molting, which occurs
   in August, to pupping, which occurs in June each year. These surveys
   are
   needed to investigate whether a change in historical survey protocol
   would result in improved information on the number of pups born and the
   proportion of seals on shore and available for counts. Surveys were
   also conducted in collaboration with the National Park Service to study
   the behavior and movements of harbor seal pups in tidewater glacial
   fjords. This research is increasingly important to help ensure
   responsible wildlife viewing given the growing numbers of tour vessels
   visiting the area, warmer water temperatures, and changing ocean
   habitats.

U.S.-Russia Comprehensive Studies of Ice-Dependent Seals and Polar Bears

   Polar bears and seals are vital resources for northern coastal Alaska
   Native communities and are key species in Arctic marine ecosystems. Yet
   no reliable abundance estimates are available for vast portions of
   their ranges. In 2016, we conducted aerial surveys in partnership with
   the Russian Federation and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to
   monitor ice-dependent seals, including bearded and ringed seals, and
   polar bears in the Chukchi Sea. In 2017, we completed image analysis on
   two million infrared and high-resolution color images collected from
   surveys.

Northern Fur Seals

   Northern fur seals breed at six locations in the North Pacific and
   Bering Sea. Three of these locations--Pribilof Islands, Bogoslof Island
   and San Miguel Island--are in the United States. The Pribilof Islands
   population has declined dramatically in recent decades and efforts are
   underway to understand the cause of the decline. Three hundred pups
   were marked so we can follow them throughout their lifetimes, adding to
   our understanding of fur seal behavior and migrations.

New Data helps Detect End to California Sea Lion Unusual Mortality Event

   During the years 2013-2016, NOAA Fisheries declared an Unusual
   Mortality Event for California sea lions due to consecutive years when
   emaciated sea lion pups were found along the California coast in high
   numbers. Our research this year detected the end to this Unusual
   Mortality Event. Our scientists assessed the growth rates of California
   sea lion pups born in 2016 (from birth to 7 months) and for animals
   born in 2017 (from birth to 4 months of age). Pups in both years grew
   at average or above average rates, suggesting that they were getting
   sufficient nutrition from their mothers and that their mothers may have
   had an easier time finding food for themselves than in previous years.

Innovations in Long-Term Survey to Study Endangered Steller Sea Lion
Population

   We conducted a biennial survey of Steller sea lion abundance in Alaska.
   This year, the survey included an aerial photographic survey of
   Southeast Alaska through the Shumagin Islands in the Western Gulf of
   Alaska. During the 57 flight hours, 20,407 images were collected. An
   unmanned hexacopter was also used to survey sites in the central
   Aleutian Islands that couldn’t be surveyed in 2016. We are able to
   monitor trends in Steller sea lion abundance through long-term surveys
   like this, which is critical for effective conservation and recovery
   efforts. New approaches are being used to streamline data processing,
   including a Zooniverse site and a crowd-sourced competition to develop
   an algorithm to automatically count sea lions in images.

   In the southern end of the species’ range, our scientists conducted a
   pup count survey of the recently established Washington state Steller
   sea lion rookery on Carroll Island/Sea Lion Rock Complex using a
   hexacopter.

Comparisons of Manned vs Unmanned Surveys to Assess Cetacean Density

   A field comparison of manned and unmanned aerial systems (UAS) surveys
   of large cetaceans in the Arctic was completed in 2015 with support
   from the Navy and the Department of the Interior and the Bureau of
   Ocean and Energy Management, and through a partnership with the North
   Slope Borough and Shell Oil. In 2017, the results showed that estimates
   of cetacean abundance were similar using either aerial platform, but
   the abundance estimates calculated from images collected by the UAS
   were less precise than the estimates calculated from observations by
   human observers in the manned aircraft. The UAS surveys were limited by
   the same types of weather that limit manned surveys for cetaceans and
   were 10x more expensive (at current costs) than the comparable manned
   survey.
