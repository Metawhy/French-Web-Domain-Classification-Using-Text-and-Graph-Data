Hunt together. Die alone.

   Creatures have overrun our world, and their flesh will be your bounty
   in a tense match-based, first person bounty hunter from the makers of
   Crysis.

Escaped Prisoners Found Hanged

   Three men were found hanged this morning near the Blanchett cemetery
   and have been identified as the prisoners thought to have escaped
   during the move from the old Jail to the new House of Detention Monday.
   Coroner Amos declared the deaths a triple murder, and added that he
   believed they had died almost 12 hours before they were found. They
   were powerful men, each having been convicted of murder, and from the
   numerous injuries and traces of blood must have fought desperately for
   their lives and possibly further mangled by animals during the night.

   [stackbook.jpg]

It hurts to read

   If I focus I can almost understand it. I discovered if you stop trying
   to read the script, it starts reading you. It’s speaking of circles.
   Circles within circles. Circles writhing within circles. Each one
   deeper. Each one worse.

   [glassplate.jpg]

Is this a photograph?

   Saturday, 3rd August 1895

   Post Mortem Examination – XXXXX

   The specimen is in an extremely deteriorated condition. The skin seems
   to have developed an unusual layer of chitonic crust making it
   exceedingly difficult to go ahead with a proper incision.

   A different form of the same creature perhaps?

   [card.jpg]

The True Deck

   Whenever I touch the True Deck I feel like my memories are bleeding. My
   blood remembers the truth. It stops leaving my body. But I know the
   cards are not real. The cards are not real… The cards are not real… The
   cards are not real…

   [syringe.jpg]

It’s in the blood

   I can feel its blood in my veins. It pulses and burns. It whispers; it
   screams. Tears at my skin from the inside, threatening to rip through,
   rip out into the world. Through its eyes I see the world of shadows. In
   the shade I track and kill. To feed the darkness in us all.

   [boxlid.jpg]

Box

   The box is empty. But when you stare into the emptiness… Fèrè Fèray
   tout ko Fèray sé kouto, Fèrè Fèray tout ko Fèray sé manchèt

   [insect.jpg]

Matye

   Si se Bèlzeboul ki ban m' pouvwa pou chase move lespri, patizan nou yo,
   ak ki pouvwa yo menm yo chase move lespri? Se poutèt sa, se yo menm
   menm k'ap ban nou tò.

   [multitool.jpg]

A strange tool

   A typical rancher’s tool and jack of all trades. Working as both a
   hammer and wire cutter, there’s more to this than meets the eye.
   Additional modifications, such as an integrated lock pick, suggest it’s
   good for more than erecting cattle enclosures.

   [stickybomb.jpg]

A barbed bomb

   Deadly when thrown, this crude and cruel homemade grenade features a
   360° impact trigger that sets a short fuse. Once lodged into a surface,
   for instance flesh, its prongs ensure that it sticks in place long
   enough for the explosive to go off.

Bandages

   Six yards of pliable muslin, rolled into a compact cylinder and
   fastened with two pins. Doesn’t sound like much, but having one in your
   possession can mean the difference between life and death, either
   limping out alive, or bleeding out in a ditch.

Is this the call?

   Most esteemed Dr. Jones,

   You will have heard of me, so I will waste no time with introductions.
   I have learned certain facts about the American Hunters’ Association of
   which you are Director, and so I will speak plainly. I have seen this
   city’s end. It has already begun, and the corruption spreads. But we
   may yet avoid that end. I sense that you, too, have been into the
   shade. You hold great power, and yet you hide behind the mask of
   directorships and medicine. Cast off your mask, and let us act!
   Together. Yon sèl lang se janm ase.

   With the highest respect,

   Marie Laveau

When Two Hunters Risk Everything

The sun is setting on the Wild West.

   You and your partner are members of a secret hunting society that
   tracks and kills creatures. The bounties are high, but so are the
   risks. The smallest mistake will cost you everything—your bounty, your
   gear, your life, and your very soul.

   Some hunt for wealth, some for power. Some hunt to protect others, some
   hunt for glory. You must track your quarry through a dark and
   treacherous world. Winner takes all. Fail, and go straight to hell.
     __________________________________________________________________

And Evil Waits Unseen

Monstrous creatures lurk in the shadows. Insidious. Powerful. Hungry.
Waiting.

   Hunting for sport is child’s play. This is a different kind of game,
   one with high stakes and even higher rewards. You will face creatures
   that want to gorge themselves on your flesh and devour your soul.

   Everything and everyone is against you—even the earth itself. Make one
   mistake, and you will die in filth, forgotten. Succeed, and the bounty
   and the glory will be immense.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Hunter Becomes the Hunted

You are not alone in the darkness.

   Other hunters seek the same prey, lust for the same bounty. Get in
   their way, and you may find yourself their target. Get caught, and they
   will pry your trophy from your cold, dead hands.
