Quick Start Guide: Provision Intel® Optane™ DC Persistent Memory Modules

   By USHARANI U., published on April 11, 2019, updated September 5, 2019

Introduction

   Intel® Optane™ DC persistent memory is a disruptive technology that
   creates a new tier between memory and storage. Intel® Optane™ DC memory
   modules support two modes—Memory mode for volatile use cases, and App
   Direct mode, which provides byte-addressable persistent storage. More
   information about each operating mode can be found in the article
   Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory Operating Modes Explained.

   In this guide, we provide instructions for configuring and managing
   Intel Optane DC memory modules using the ipmctl utility and other basic
   methods to expose persistent memory namespaces to applications using
   operating system-specific namespace management tools.

   ipmctl is an open source utility created and maintained by Intel
   specifically for configuring and managing Intel Optane DC persistent
   memory modules. It is available for both Linux* and Windows* from the
   ipmctl project page on GitHub*.

   There are vendor-agnostic tools available in both Linux and Windows to
   manage non-volatile dual in-line memory modules (NVDIMMs). Non-volatile
   Device Control (ndctl) is an open-source utility used for managing
   namespaces in Linux, and Microsoft* has created PowerShell* cmdlets for
   persistent memory namespace management.

Persistent Memory Provisioning Concepts

   This section describes the basic terminology and concepts that apply to
   configuration and management of NVDIMMs.

Region

   A region is a group of one or more NVDIMMs, also known as an
   interleaved set. Regions can be created in either n-way interleaved or
   non-interleaved. Interleaving is a technique that makes multiple
   persistent memory devices appear as a single logical virtual address
   space. It allows spreading adjacent virtual addresses within a page
   across multiple memory devices. This hardware-level parallelism
   increases the available bandwidth from the devices. Regions can only be
   created or changed on Intel Optane DC persistent memory modules using
   ipmctl.

Label

   Intel Optane DC memory modules support labels, which allow regions to
   be further divided into namespaces. A label contains metadata stored on
   an NVDIMM. It is similar to a partition table while a namespace is a
   partition.

Namespace

   A namespace defines a contiguously addressed range of non-volatile
   memory conceptually similar to a hard disk partition, SCSI logical unit
   (LUN), or an NVM Express* namespace. It is the unit of persistent
   memory storage that appears in /dev as a device used for input/output
   (I/O). Intel recommends using the ndctl utility for creating namespaces
   for the Linux operating system.

   Diagram mapping
   Regions are created within interleaved or non-interleaved sets.
   Interleaving implies n-way mapping.

   Diagram physical address space
   Creates contiguous physical address space and provides striped reads
   and writes for better throughput.

   Diagram namespaces
   Similar to SSD, the raw capacity of a region is partitioned into one or
   more logical devices called namespaces.

   Figure 1. Persistent memory provisioning options

DAX

   Direct Access (DAX) is a mechanism that allows applications to directly
   access persistent media from the CPU (through loads and stores),
   bypassing the traditional I/O stack (page cache and block layer). File
   systems that have been extended for DAX-enabled persistent memory
   include Linux ext4 and XFS, and Windows NTFS. These file systems bypass
   the I/O subsystem to directly use persistent memory as byte-addressable
   load/store memory as the fastest and shortest path to data stored in
   persistent memory. In addition to eliminating I/O operations, this path
   enables small data writes to be executed faster than those to
   traditional block storage devices.

Which Mode Should I Use?

   Memory mode is volatile and is all about providing a large main memory
   at a cost lower than dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) without any
   changes to the application, which usually results in cost savings.
   There can be a performance advantage if you are able to fit your
   working set in memory instead of paging it to disk.

   App Direct is for persistence, where you are displacing traditional
   non-volatile storage, such as solid-state drives (SSDs) and NVMe
   devices, with considerably faster persistent memory. This is usually a
   big performance improvement, but not always. If an application that
   tends to page something in from disk and then use the data in that page
   for quite some time while the page is in DRAM, you get DRAM speeds most
   of the time. With a DAX file system, the page cache is bypassed,
   providing direct access to the underlying persistent memory so you get
   the persistent memory media performance.

   Therefore, it is difficult to say which is faster between the volatile
   Memory mode and the App Direct mode. Performance is most optimal when
   the application developer determines which data structures belong in
   each storage tier: DRAM, persistent memory, and non-volatile storage.

   Profiling tools are available to characterize application workloads.
   This helps to evaluate which mode best fits the application.
   Applications should be tested in both modes to fully determine what
   optimizations are necessary to achieve the maximum performance and
   benefits of persistent memory. For more information on the available
   persistent memory analysis tools, visit the Tools page on the Intel®
   Developer Zone PMEM site.

Introduction to Provisioning Utilities

ipmctl: Intel® Optane™ DC Persistent Memory Configuration Utility

   The ipmctl utility is used to configure and manage Intel Optane DC
   memory modules. This tool is available in several distributions of
   Linux and Microsoft Windows 2019 server or later.

   At a high level, ipmctl supports the following functionality:
     * Discovery
     * Configuration
     * Firmware management
     * Security functionality management
     * Health monitoring
     * Performance tracking
     * Debugging and troubleshooting

Installing ipmctl

   Refer to the instructions in the ipmctl README.md on the ipmctl GitHub
   project page.

Getting Help

   For a comprehensive list of commands and their descriptions, run man
   ipmctl or ipmctl help.

ndctl: Namespace Management in Linux*

   ndctl is a vendor-neutral Linux-only utility used to manage namespaces
   in Linux. It is designed to work with NVDIMMs from different vendors,
   including Intel Optane DC persistent memory modules. We will use ndctl
   for creating and managing namespaces in Linux.

   ndctl supports the following functionality:
     * Show persistent memory module information
     * Manage namespaces and configuration labels
     * Monitor health
     * Manage security - passphrases and secure erase
     * Error injection/testing

Installing ndctl

   The ndctl utility is available in most Linux package repositories, or
   you can download and compile the source code, which is available on the
   ndctl GitHub project page. Additional information can be found in the
   NDCTL User Guide.

Getting Help

   For a comprehensive list of commands and their descriptions, run man
   ndctl or ndctl help.

PowerShell Cmdlets: Namespace Management in Windows*

   Microsoft has introduced PowerShell* cmdlets for persistent memory
   namespace management. Following is a list of the most commonly used
   commands:

Get-PmemDisk

   Returns one or more logical persistent memory disks. The returned
   object has information about size, atomicity type, health status, and
   underlying physical devices.

Get-PmemPhysicalDevice

   Returns one or more physical persistent memory devices. The returned
   object has information about size(s), RFIC, device location, and
   health/operational status.

New-PmemDisk

   Creates a new disk out of a given unused region. Writes out the labels
   to create the namespace, then rebuilds the SCM stacks to expose the new
   logical device.

Remove-PmemDisk

   Removes the given persistent memory disk.

Get-PmemUnusedRegion

   Returns aggregate persistent memory regions available for provisioning
   a logical device.

Initialize-PmemPhysicalDevice

   Writes zeros to the label storage area, writes new label index blocks,
   and then rebuilds the SCM stacks to reflect the changes.

Getting Help

   Refer to the Interleave sets section in the Understand and deploy
   persistent memory Windows persistent memory PowerShell Cmdlet
   documentation.

Software

   This section provides an overview of the software ecosystem enabled for
   Intel DC Optane persistent memory.

Operating System Support for Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory

   Several distributions of Linux include support for both App Direct and
   Memory mode. See Operating System OS for Intel Optane DC Persistent
   Memory.

   Note: Starting with Red Hat* Enterprise Linux 7.3, technology reviews
   using persistent memory are enabled for both the Ext4 and XFS file
   systems. Please refer to Red Hat documentation for more information.

Linux Kernel Support

   The Linux NVDIMM/persistent memory drivers were enabled by default
   starting with Linux kernel 4.2. We currently recommend kernel version
   4.19 or later.

Custom Kernel

   If you compile or build custom kernels, verify that support for
   persistent memory is enabled. Here is a list of parameters you need to
   enable in the kernel configuration file, usually found under
   /boot/config -uname –r:

   (Compile or custom kernel)
     * CONFIG_ZONE_DEVICE=y
     * CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE=y
     * CONFIG_ACPI_NFIT=m
     * CONFIG_LIBNVDIMM=m
     * CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PMEM=m
     * CONFIG_ND_BLK=m
     * CONFIG_BTT=y
     * CONFIG_NVDIMM_PFN=y
     * CONFIG_NVDIMM_DAX=y
     * CONFIG_DEV_DAX_PMEM=m
     * CONFIG_FS_DAX=y

Provisioning Persistent Memory Modules through the BIOS

   Intel Optane DC memory modules can be provisioned using options
   provided in the BIOS. Please refer to support provided by your system
   vendor.

Provisioning Persistent Memory Modules through UEFI

   ipmctl can be launched from a Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
   (UEFI) shell. The same features are supported in both versions of
   ipmctl. The full list of commands can be seen by running ipmctl help
   from the command line. You need root privilege to run ipmctl.

   Note: ipmctl can be used for namespace creation and management at UEFI
   level.


Provisioning Persistent Memory Modules through Operating System

Using ipmctl

   ipmctl can be launched from a Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
   (UEFI) shell or a terminal window in an operating system. The same
   features are supported in both versions of ipmctl. The full list of
   commands can be seen by running ipmctl help from the command line. You
   need root privilege to run ipmctl.

   All the commands described in this section are demonstrated for use on
   a two-socket system with 6 terabytes (TiB) of persistent memory and 384
   gigabytes (GB) of DRAM installed.

Discovery

   Before configuring Intel Optane DC memory modules, you can discover
   current module status through a list of show commands. Figure 1 shows a
   fully populated two-socket system, commonly referred to as a 2-2-2
   configuration, with a total of twelve 32-gigabyte (GiB) DDR4 memory
   modules (DIMMs) and twelve 512 GiB Intel Optane DC persistent memory
   modules.

Show Topology

   The show -topology command displays both the Intel Optane DC persistent
   memory and DDR4 DIMMs discovered in the system by enumerating the
   SMBIOS Type 17 tables. For more information, refer to ACPI
   Specifications v6.0 or later for NFIT table information.

Show Provisioned Capacity

   To check the capacity provisioned for use in different operating modes,
   use the show -memoryresources command. The MemoryCapacity and
   AppDirectCapacity values can be used to determine if the system was
   configured in Memory mode, App Direct mode, or mixed mode. The example
   below shows that the persistent memory modules are currently configured
   in App Direct mode.
ipmctl show -memoryresources
Capacity=6031.2 GiB
MemoryCapacity=0.0 GiB
AppDirectCapacity=6024.0 GiB
UnconfiguredCapacity=0.0 GiB
InaccessibleCapacity=7.2 GiB
ReservedCapacity=0.0 GiB
ipmctl show -memoryresources
Capacity=6031.2 GiB
MemoryCapacity=0.0 GiB
AppDirectCapacity=6024.0 GiB
UnconfiguredCapacity=0.0 GiB
InaccessibleCapacity=7.2 GiB
ReservedCapacity=0.0 GiB

Provisioning With ipmctl

   Provisioning Intel Optane DC persistent memory is a two-step process.
   During this process, a goal is specified and stored on the persistent
   memory modules for the BIOS to read on the next reboot. A goal
   configures Intel Optane DC t memory modules in Memory mode, App Direct
   mode, or both.

Create a Configuration Goal

Memory Mode

   Any percentage of Intel Optane DC persistent memory module capacity
   across sockets can be provisioned in Memory mode, as described below.
   In this example, 100% of the available persistent memory capacity is to
   be provisioned in Memory mode. You can always use the -f option to
   overwrite any existing goal, which is a destructive operation.
ipmctl create -goal memorymode=100

The following configuration will be applied:
 SocketID | DimmID | MemorySize | AppDirect1Size | AppDirect2Size

App Direct Mode

   Intel Optane DC memory modules can be provisioned in App Direct mode
   with interleaving enabled or disabled. As described in the Persistent
   Memory Provisioning Concepts section above, interleaving increases the
   throughput of reads and writes to persistent memory.

   Configure App Direct Mode with Interleaved Modules

   The command below sets a goal to create a persistent memory region that
   is interleaved across all the modules on each CPU socket. Creating an
   interleaved set that spans multiple CPU sockets is not allowed. Refer
   to the following resources for more information on alternative methods:
     * Using Persistent Memory Devices with the Linux Device Mapper
     * Using Linux Volume Manager (LVM) with Persistent Memory

   The default create goal command creates an interleaved region
   configured for App Direct mode. The following two commands are
   equivalent:
ipmctl create -goal
ipmctl create -goal PersistentMemoryType=AppDirect
The following configuration will be applied:
 SocketID | DimmID | MemorySize | AppDirect1Size | AppDirect2Size

Mixed Mode

   Intel Optane DC persistent memory can be configured such that part of
   the capacity is assigned to Memory mode and the rest to App Direct
   mode. When part or all of persistent memory module capacity is set to
   Memory mode, all the DRAM capacity is hidden from the application and
   becomes the last-level cache.

   The following example assigns 60% of the available persistent memory
   capacity to Memory mode. The rest is configured as an interleaved set
   for App Direct mode.
ipmctl create -goal Memorymode=60
The following configuration will be applied:

A reboot is required to process new memory allocation goals.

Change Configuration Goal

   When creating a goal, ipmctl checks to see whether or not the NVDIMMs
   are already configured. If so, it prints a message that the current
   configuration is to be deleted before creating a new goal.
ipmctl create -goal MemoryMode=100
Create region configuration goal failed: Error (115) - A requested DIMM already
has a configured goal. Delete this existing goal before creating a new one

ipmctl delete –goal
Delete allocation goal from DIMM 0x0001: Success
Delete allocation goal from DIMM 0x0011: Success

Dump Current Goal

ipmctl dump -destination testfile -system -config

Successfully dumped system configuration to file: testfile

Create a Goal from a Configuration File

   Goals can be provisioned using a configuration file with the load
   -source <file> -goal command. To save the current configuration to a
   file, use the dump -destination <file> -system –config command. This
   allows for the same configuration to be applied to multiple systems or
   restored to the same system.
# ipmctl dump -destination testfile -system -config
# ipmctl load -source myPath/testfile –goal

Show Current Goal

   To see the current goal, if there is one, use the show goal command.
ipmctl show -goal

There are no goal configs defined in the system.
Please use 'show -region' to display currently valid persistent memory regions.

Confirm Mode Change

   So far, we have seen how the goal can be set for different modes. Upon
   reboot, run the following commands to see if the mode is applied
   correctly. The current output shows that the goal was set to configure
   the entire capacity in Memory mode.
ipmctl show –memoryresources
Capacity=6031.2 GiB
MemoryCapacity=6024.0 GiB
AppDirectCapacity=0.0 GiB
UnconfiguredCapacity=0.0 GiB
InaccessibleCapacity=7.2 GiB
ReservedCapacity=0.0 GiB

   If the mode is changed from Memory mode to App Direct mode, upon reboot
   a single region per socket is created. If the mode is changed from App
   Direct mode to Memory mode, there are no regions created. Use the
   following command to see the regions created:
ipmctl show -region

 SocketID | ISetID             | PersistentMemoryType | Capacity   | FreeCapacit
y | HealthState
=====================================================================
 0x0000   | 0xa0927f48a8112ccc | AppDirect            | 3012.0 GiB | 3012.0 GiB

  | Healthy

Delete Configuration

   The current configuration can be deleted by first disabling and
   destroying namespaces and then disabling the active regions.

Namespace Management in Linux

   In this section, we show how to use ndctl commands to manage
   namespaces. For more information, refer to Creating Namespaces in the
   ndctl User Guide.

List Active Namespaces

   See below for an example of how to list active namespaces.
ndctl list -N
[
  {
    "dev":"namespace0.0",
    "mode":"fsdax",
    "map":"mem",
    "size":4294967296,
    "sector_size":512,
    "blockdev":"pmem0"
  },
  {
    "dev":"namespace1.0",
    "mode":"fsdax",
    "map":"dev",
    "size":3183575302144,
    "uuid":"c8a9751c-0d5b-47ab-b45f-70fe54f7ce43",
    "sector_size":512,
    "align":2097152,
    "blockdev":"pmem1"
  }
]

Create Namespace

   The ndctl create-namespace command:
     * Creates a new namespace in fsdax mode, by default. The size of the
       namespace is the same as the region size minus size of the
       metadata. Other modes supported include sector, devdax, and raw.
     * Creates a new /dev/pmem{X[.Y]} device
          + The X value represents the region in which the namespace is
            created. This defaults to zero (0). If more than one namespace
            is created within a region, the naming convention of pmem{X.Y}
            is used, where Y represents a sequentially increasing integer
            value for the new namespace.
          + If multiple namespaces are created within a region, the first
            namespace is always created as pmem0; it does not get
            re-enumerated to pmem0.0 like subsequent namespaces.

# ndctl create-namespace
{
 "dev":"namespace0.0",
 "mode":"fsdax",
 "map":"dev",
 "size":"123.04 GiB (132.12 GB)",
 "uuid":"a60e6a4f-274d-4cd5-8d39-c8dd263345e2",
 "raw_uuid":"8d28948f-5434-4c8d-8efa-581eacad265a",
 "sector_size":512,
 "blockdev":"pmem0",
 "numa_node":0
}

   On Linux, run the following command to see if the device was created.
   Then create a DAX-enabled file system such as XFS or EXT4 on the new
   persistent memory device.
# ls -l /dev/pmem*
brw-rw----. 1 root disk 259, 0 Jul 9 10:42 /dev/pmem0

Create a 50 GiB 'fsdax' Mode Namespace

   The size value provided to ndctl includes space required for metadata,
   so the resulting available capacity for a file system will be smaller,
   as the following example shows:
# ndctl create-namespace -m fsdax -s 50G
{
 "dev":"namespace0.0",
 "mode":"fsdax",
 "map":"dev",
 "size":"49.22 GiB (52.85 GB)",
 "uuid":"638d67f3-4c18-4b2e-a6f2-a044bdc82253",
 "raw_uuid":"6c6dfdad-e12f-418d-9fb0-3a75032dd9de",
 "sector_size":512,
 "blockdev":"pmem0",
 "numa_node":0
}

   Note: If the remaining capacity needs to be assigned to another
   namespace using the same or a different mode, it can be assigned to the
   new namespace without specifying the -s <size> option. For example,
   executing ndctl create-namespace after the command above creates a new
   namespace in the same region using all remaining capacity (~78 GiB):
# ndctl create-namespace
{
 "dev":"namespace0.1",
 "mode":"fsdax",
 "map":"dev",
 "size":"73.83 GiB (79.27 GB)",
 "uuid":"d7f9473e-97aa-48cf-aefa-128797c83e88",
 "raw_uuid":"6c116e57-19dd-43d8-ae03-039f1588a23a",
 "sector_size":512,
 "blockdev":"pmem0.1",
 "numa_node":0
}

Create a Namespace with a Friendly Name (Tag)

   Tagging the namespace with a friendly name or description using the -n,
   --name option can be useful to show what a namespace is used for. This
   is particularly useful when provisioning space for multiple end users
   or applications, or to identify a namespace with for production or
   test/dev environments. Creating a namespace with a tag/name/description
   can be done as follows:
# ndctl create-namespace -n "PROD Web DB 1"
{
 "dev":"namespace0.0",
 "mode":"fsdax",
 "map":"dev",
 "size":"123.04 GiB (132.12 GB)",
 "uuid":"6a0abb59-5279-4731-921a-0099101e17f2",
 "raw_uuid":"03b40e23-56e1-407a-b5d1-f1ec929645c1",
 "sector_size":512,
 "blockdev":"pmem0",
 "name":"PROD Web DB 1",
 "numa_node":0
}

List Namespaces in a Region

ndctl list -RuN -r region1
{
  "regions":[
    {
      "dev":"region1",
      "size":"3012.00 GiB (3234.11 GB)",
      "available_size":0,
      "max_available_extent":0,
      "type":"pmem",
      "iset_id":"0xa0927f48a8112ccc",
      "persistence_domain":"memory_controller",
      "namespaces":[
        {
          "dev":"namespace1.0",
          "mode":"fsdax",
          "map":"dev",
          "size":"2964.94 GiB (3183.58 GB)",
          "uuid":"c8a9751c-0d5b-47ab-b45f-70fe54f7ce43",
          "sector_size":512,
          "align":2097152,
          "blockdev":"pmem1"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Disable Namespace

   Warning: Disabling a namespace while it is mounted or in use results in
   undefined behavior by the application(s) using the namespace. Always
   stop any applications and unmount file systems in fsdax mode before
   disabling a namespace.
ndctl disable-namespace namespace1.0
disabled 1 namespace

Destroy Namespace

   Disable namespace and destroy namespace are called to clear existing
   namespaces before creating a new goal.
ndctl destroy-namespace namespace0.0
destroyed 1 namespace

Disable Region

$ ndctl disable-region region0
disabled 1 region

   To list the regions, run the following command from PowerShell. If the
   output of this command is empty, no regions exist on the persistent
   memory modules. Recall that ipmctl is used to create regions.

   PowerShell command examples are run on a server configured in the 2:2:1
   configuration.
PS>Get-PmemUnusedRegion
PS C:\Windows\system32> Get-PmemUnusedRegion
  RegionId    TotalSizeInBytes    DeviceId

     1           2156073582592       {1, 101, 11, 111}

   After creating regions using ipmctl and then rebooting, the newly
   created interleave sets are represented as persistent memory unused
   regions. These are the regions that are not assigned to a logical
   persistent memory device on the system.

Creating Namespaces or Persistent Memory Disk

PS> New-PmemDisk
Creating new persistent memory disk. This may take a few moments

   Windows allows a namespace to be created on a region and the capacity
   to be visible to the Windows operating system and used by applications.
   Just as an SSD can be carved into partitions, persistent memory
   namespaces represent the unit of storage that appears as a device that
   can be used for I/O.

   When the new persistent memory disk is created, go to the Computer
   Management > Storage > Disk Management console to view the new disk.
   You must initialize the disk using MBR or GPT partitioning before the
   logical disk manager can access it.

Delete Namespace

Expose Persistent Memory Regions to an Application

   We have shown how ipmctl is used to create regions, and ndctl to create
   one or more namespaces within the regions to expose persistent memory
   devices to applications.

   Though ipmctl supports creating namespaces, Intel recommends using
   vendor-agnostic tools like ndctl on Linux, and PowerShell persistent
   memory cmdlets to create and manage namespaces on Windows.

   On Linux, when a namespace is created, a persistent memory device is
   created: /dev/pmem{n}, where n starts with 0. On Windows, an entry for
   the newly created persistent memory disk appears in the Device Manager
   and Storage > Disk Management windows.

FSDAX Namespace

   File system DAX (FSDAX) mode is the default namespace mode when
   creating namespaces using ndctl. If you specify ndctl create-namespace
   with no options, it creates a device (/dev/pmemX[.Y]) that supports the
   DAX capabilities of Linux file systems. Both XFS and EXT4 support the
   DAX feature. DAX removes the page cache from the I/O path and allows
   mmap(2) to establish direct mappings to persistent memory media.

   As shown in the diagram below, when persistent memory modules are
   configured in FSDAX mode, applications have the ability to: 1) memory
   map a file on a DAX mounted file system then perform direct load and
   store access to persistent memory region, or 2) continue to use
   standard file APIs, which require no changes to the application.

   persistent memory in f s d a x mode

   To mount a DAX-enabled file system, we use the –o dax mount option. The
   following commands show the process of configuring the persistent
   memory modules for App Direct using ipmctl, then creating a single
   namespace on one of the regions, and finally creating and mounting the
   DAX enabled file system. Run the commands shown in the example below as
   root.
1.      Create goal to create a region in App Direct mode on reboot
        a.      ipmctl create –goal PersistentMemoryType=AppDirect
2.      Show goal
        a.      ipmctl show -goal
3.      Reboot
        a.      ndctl create-namespace -r region2
4.      Create namespace using ndctl. Default mode is fsdax.
        ndctl create-namespace
        {
        "dev":"namespace2.0",
        "mode":"fsdax",
        "map":"dev",
        "size":"2964.94 GiB (3183.58 GB)",
        "uuid":"41d252c8-55b3-4683-989a-d131e8136870",
        "sector_size":512,
        "align":2097152,
        "blockdev":"pmem2"
        }
5.      Check out the pmem device created
        a.      ls -l /dev/pmem*
6.      Create filesystem and mount it on the pmem device
        a.      mkfs.ext4 -f /dev/pmem<x>
7.      Create a directory
        a.      mkdir /mnt/mypmem
8.      Mount filesystem with -o dax option
        a.      mount -o dax /dev/pmem<x> /mnt/mypmem
9.      Create a file on the file system and memory map it

Sector Mode Namespace (Storage over App Direct)

   For file systems or applications that use a traditional storage API,
   create a namespace with sector mode.

   Persistent memory-based storage can perform I/O at byte, or more
   accurately, cache line granularity. However, exposing such storage as a
   traditional block device does not guarantee atomicity and requires the
   block drivers for persistent memory to provide this support.

   Traditional SSDs typically provide protection against torn sectors in
   hardware, to complete in-flight block writes. Whereas, if a persistent
   memory write is in progress and a power failure happens, the block may
   contain a mix of old and new data. Existing applications may not be
   prepared to handle such a scenario since they are unlikely to protect
   against torn sectors or metadata.

   The Block Translation Table (BTT) provides atomic sector update
   semantics for persistent memory devices so that applications that rely
   on sector writes not being torn can continue to do so.

   As shown in the diagram below, the BTT manifests itself as a stacked
   block device and reserves a portion of the underlying storage for its
   metadata. At the heart of it is an indirection table that re-maps all
   of the blocks on the volume. It can be thought of as an extremely
   simple file system that only provides atomic sector updates. The DAX
   feature is not supported in this mode.

   app direct region

   In the example shown below, the default sector size used is 4 KB.
   Sector atomicity is provided by kernel drivers.

Commands to Create Persistent Storage over App Direct

1.      Create goal using ipmctl command
        o        ipmctl create –goal PersistentMemoryType=AppDirect
2.      Show goal
        o       # ipmctl show -goal
3.      Reboot
4.      Create namespace with sector mode using ndctl
        5.      # ndctl create-namespace -m sector
                {
                "dev":"namespace0.0",
                "mode":"sector",
                "size":"124.88 GiB (134.09 GB)",
                "uuid":"08f4e273-bbdd-4d1d-85e8-cf1f847e1df7",
                "raw_uuid":"f3bd03ad-4225-4919-a370-bb6293180e4d",
                "sector_size":4096,
                "blockdev":"pmem0s",
                "numa_node":0
        }
6.      # ls -l /dev/pmem* to view the block device
        o       brw-rw----. 1 root disk 259, 0 Jul 9 10:47 /dev/pmem0s
7.      Use unmodified application (using standard File API)


Configure Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory in Virtualized Environments

   Documentation for virtualized and container environments is provided by
   the software vendor. These are links to virtualization technologies
   that support persistent memory:
     * VMware* vSphere
     * KVM/QEMU
     * Hyper-V
     * Kubernetes*
          + Persistent Memory Container Storage Interface (PMEM-CSI) is a
            storage driver for container orchestrators like Kubernetes. It
            makes Intel Optane DC persistent memory available as a file
            system volume to container applications. For more information,
            read Persistent Memory-Container Storage Interface for
            Kubernetes.

Emulate Persistent Memory

   If you are a software developer who wants to get started developing
   software or modifying an application to have persistent memory
   awareness, but you do not have access to a system with persistent
   memory hardware, it is possible to emulate it. Emulation is not
   intended for performance or benchmarking as it cannot simulate the
   performance characteristics. Several approaches used to emulate
   persistent memory are described below.

Using System DRAM

   The article How to Emulate Persistent Memory Using Dynamic
   Random-access Memory (DRAM) describes the requirements and steps for
   using system DRAM to emulate persistent memory. This approach does not
   provide persistent storage characteristics. When the system is
   rebooted, all the configuration and data is lost.

Using KVM/QEMU

   KVM and QEMU can be used to create virtual machines that run their own
   dedicated operating system and persistent memory regions. This approach
   allows the guest virtual machines (VMs) to use ndctl as if they had
   access to persistent memory. The host can provide persistent storage
   behavior by mapping the persistent memory devices from a non-volatile
   storage device such as an SSD. This approach most closely matches that
   of real persistent memory hardware.

   On a host system with persistent memory, it is possible to directly
   assign a persistent memory device or file residing on a DAX mounted
   file system to the guest, and for that guest to mount the device with
   DAX support.

   Refer to Using QEMU Virtualization for more information.

Frequently Asked Questions on Provisioning

   This section describes some of the issues and messages that are
   commonly seen when configuring Intel Optane DC persistent memory.

   When I configure in App Direct mode, why do I see part of the capacity
          as “Inaccessible” and “Unconfigured”?
          Intel DC Optane persistent memory reserves a certain amount of
          capacity for metadata. For first-generation Intel Optane DC
          persistent memory, it is approximately 0.5% per DIMM.

          Unconfigured capacity is the capacity that is not mapped into
          the system’s physical address space. It could also be the
          capacity that is inaccessible because the processor does not
          support the entire capacity on the platform.

ipmctl show -memoryresources

Capacity=6031.2 GiB
MemoryCapacity=0.0 GiB
AppDirectCapacity=6024.0 GiB
UnconfiguredCapacity=0.0 GiB
InaccessibleCapacity=7.2 GiB
ReservedCapacity=0.0 GiB

   How do I find the firmware version on the modules?

ipmctl show -dimm
 DimmID | Capacity  | HealthState | ActionRequired | LockState | FWVersion
==============================================================================
 0x0001 | 502.6 GiB | Healthy         | 0                            |

   My processor does not allow me to configure the entire Intel Optane DC
          memory module capacity on the platform. How do I find out
          maximum supported capacity on the processor?
          Run the following command to display the maximum amount of
          memory that is allowed to be mapped into the system physical
          address space for this processor based on the processor SKU. For
          more information on the capacity supported by the processor SKU
          on your platform, run the following commands:

ipmctl show -d TotalMappedMemory -socket
---SocketID=0x0000---
   TotalMappedMemory=3203.0 GiB
---SocketID=0x0001---
   TotalMappedMemory=3202.5 GiB

   How do I unlock the encrypted modules?
          The ability to enable security, unlock a persistent memory
          region, and change passphrase is enabled in both the Linux
          kernel driver 5.0 and is also available in ndctl.

   Does Intel Optane DC persistent memory support SMART errors?
          Yes.

   How do I find a module’s lifetime?
          The remaining persistent memory module life as a percentage
          value of factory-expected life span can be found by running the
          following command:

ipmctl show -o text -sensor percentageremaining -dimm
 DimmID | Type                | CurrentValue | CurrentState
============================================================
 0x0001 | PercentageRemaining | 100%         | Normal
 0x0011 | PercentageRemaining | 100%         | Normal
 0x0021 | PercentageRemaining | 100%         | Normal

   When configured in Mixed mode, is the DRAM capacity seen by the
          operating system and applications?
          No. When part of the capacity is configured in Memory mode, DRAM
          is hidden from the operating System and the capacity configured
          in Memory mode becomes the volatile capacity for the capacity
          configured in App Direct mode.

   I am adding 2 new DIMMs and would like to erase all the existing
          configurations and safely reconfigure the hardware but was
          unable to delete regions.
          To create a new configuration, you need to delete the existing
          goal and create a new one as shown below. There is no need to
          delete regions. Create-goal -f will overwrite the existing goal
          and on reboot you will see the new goal.

1.      ndctl destroy-namespace namespace0.0
or
ndctl destroy-namespace -f all
2.      ipmctl delete -goal
Delete memory allocation goal from DIMM 0x0001: Success
Delete memory allocation goal from DIMM 0x0011: Success
Delete memory allocation goal from DIMM 0x0101: Success
Delete memory allocation goal from DIMM 0x0111: Success
3.      ipmctl create -f -goal persistentmemorytype=appdirect

   Why am I seeing a certain amount of capacity shown as reserved?
          Reserved capacity is total system Intel Optane DC persistent
          memory capacity that is reserved. This capacity is the
          persistent memory partition capacity (rounded down for
          alignment) less any App Direct capacity. Reserved capacity
          typically results from a Memory Allocation Goal request that
          specified the Reserved property. This capacity is not mapped to
          system physical address (SPA) space.

          A list of validated and popular configurations are provided in
          the System Requirements section of this document. Other
          configurations are likely to  not be supported by the BIOS and
          may not boot.

Managing Namespaces

       in Windows.

Summary

   This quick start guide describes methods to provision Intel Optane DC
   persistent memory modules using ipmctl and operating system
   specific persistent memory vendor-neutral utilities. ipmctl is
   necessary for discovering Intel Optane DC memory module resources,
   creating goals and regions, updating the firmware, and debugging issues
   with these persistent memory modules. Learn more about each of these

   Sorry, we can't translate this content right now, please try again
   later.

Getting Started with the Intel® Galileo Board on Windows*

   This guide contains steps to set up your Intel® Galileo board,
   including steps to setup a serial terminal, connect over Wi-Fi*, and
   install your preferred integrated development environment (IDE) for
   general development in JavaScript*, C/C++, or Python*. If you want to
   get going quickly in Arduino, skip to installing the Arduino IDE.

   The steps include instructions that are compatible with the following
   versions of the Windows* operating system:
     * Windows 7* 32/64
     * Windows 8* 32/64
     * Windows 8.1* 32/64

Material Requirements

   Here is a list of all the requirements you'll need in order to assemble
   and set up either your Gen 1 or Gen 2 board:
     * A micro-SD card. The card must be at least 2 GB and can be up to 32
       GB
     * An SD card reader for your system
     * Intel® Galileo Gen 1 board needs:
     *
          + A 5-V power supply
          + A DB-9-to-3.5mm audio cable
          + A serial-to-USB cable
     * Intel® Galileo Gen 2 board needs:
     *
          + 6-pin Serial to Type A USB cable (FTDI cable # TTL-232R-3V3 is
            recommended)
          + A 7-15-V DC power supply
     * If you want to set up your board for Wi-Fi, you'll need one of
       these adapters:
          + Intel® Centrino® Wireless-N 135
          + Intel® Centrino® Advanced –N 6205

   If you want to get going quickly in Arduino, skip to installing the
   Arduino IDE.

Quick Start Guide: Provision Intel® Optane™ DC Persistent Memory Modules

   By USHARANI U., published on April 11, 2019, updated September 5, 2019
   Translating...[Translate__________]
   This is a computer translation of the original content. It is provided
   for general information only and should not be relied upon as complete
   or accurate.
   Sorry, we can't translate this content right now, please try again
   later.

Introduction

   Intel® Optane™ DC persistent memory is a disruptive technology that
   creates a new tier between memory and storage. Intel® Optane™ DC memory
   modules support two modes—Memory mode for volatile use cases, and App
   Direct mode, which provides byte-addressable persistent storage. More
   information about each operating mode can be found in the article
   Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory Operating Modes Explained.

   In this guide, we provide instructions for configuring and managing
   Intel Optane DC memory modules using the ipmctl utility and other basic
   methods to expose persistent memory namespaces to applications using
   operating system-specific namespace management tools.

   ipmctl is an open source utility created and maintained by Intel
   specifically for configuring and managing Intel Optane DC persistent
   memory modules. It is available for both Linux* and Windows* from the
   ipmctl project page on GitHub*.

   There are vendor-agnostic tools available in both Linux and Windows to
   manage non-volatile dual in-line memory modules (NVDIMMs). Non-volatile
   Device Control (ndctl) is an open-source utility used for managing
   namespaces in Linux, and Microsoft* has created PowerShell* cmdlets for
   persistent memory namespace management.

Persistent Memory Provisioning Concepts

   This section describes the basic terminology and concepts that apply to
   configuration and management of NVDIMMs.

Region

   A region is a group of one or more NVDIMMs, also known as an
   interleaved set. Regions can be created in either n-way interleaved or
   non-interleaved. Interleaving is a technique that makes multiple
   persistent memory devices appear as a single logical virtual address
   space. It allows spreading adjacent virtual addresses within a page
   across multiple memory devices. This hardware-level parallelism
   increases the available bandwidth from the devices. Regions can only be
   created or changed on Intel Optane DC persistent memory modules using
   ipmctl.

Label

   Intel Optane DC memory modules support labels, which allow regions to
   be further divided into namespaces. A label contains metadata stored on
   an NVDIMM. It is similar to a partition table while a namespace is a
   partition.

Namespace

   A namespace defines a contiguously addressed range of non-volatile
   memory conceptually similar to a hard disk partition, SCSI logical unit
   (LUN), or an NVM Express* namespace. It is the unit of persistent
   memory storage that appears in /dev as a device used for input/output
   (I/O). Intel recommends using the ndctl utility for creating namespaces
   for the Linux operating system.

   Diagram mapping
   Regions are created within interleaved or non-interleaved sets.
   Interleaving implies n-way mapping.

   Diagram physical address space
   Creates contiguous physical address space and provides striped reads
   and writes for better throughput.

   Diagram namespaces
   Similar to SSD, the raw capacity of a region is partitioned into one or
   more logical devices called namespaces.

DAX

   Direct Access (DAX) is a mechanism that allows applications to directly
   access persistent media from the CPU (through loads and stores),
   bypassing the traditional I/O stack (page cache and block layer). File
   systems that have been extended for DAX-enabled persistent memory
   include Linux ext4 and XFS, and Windows NTFS. These file systems bypass
   the I/O subsystem to directly use persistent memory as byte-addressable
   load/store memory as the fastest and shortest path to data stored in
   persistent memory. In addition to eliminating I/O operations, this path
   enables small data writes to be executed faster than those to
   traditional block storage devices.

Which Mode Should I Use?

   Memory mode is volatile and is all about providing a large main memory
   at a cost lower than dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) without any
   changes to the application, which usually results in cost savings.
   There can be a performance advantage if you are able to fit your
   working set in memory instead of paging it to disk.

   App Direct is for persistence, where you are displacing traditional
   non-volatile storage, such as solid-state drives (SSDs) and NVMe
   devices, with considerably faster persistent memory. This is usually a
   big performance improvement, but not always. If an application that
   tends to page something in from disk and then use the data in that page
   for quite some time while the page is in DRAM, you get DRAM speeds most
   of the time. With a DAX file system, the page cache is bypassed,
   providing direct access to the underlying persistent memory so you get
   the persistent memory media performance.

   Therefore, it is difficult to say which is faster between the volatile
   Memory mode and the App Direct mode. Performance is most optimal when
   the application developer determines which data structures belong in
   each storage tier: DRAM, persistent memory, and non-volatile storage.

   Profiling tools are available to characterize application workloads.
   This helps to evaluate which mode best fits the application.
   Applications should be tested in both modes to fully determine what
   optimizations are necessary to achieve the maximum performance and
   benefits of persistent memory. For more information on the available
   persistent memory analysis tools, visit the Tools page on the Intel®
   Developer Zone PMEM site.

PowerShell Cmdlets: Namespace Management in Windows*

   Microsoft has introduced PowerShell* cmdlets for persistent memory
   namespace management. Following is a list of the most commonly used
   commands:

Get-PmemDisk

   Returns one or more logical persistent memory disks. The returned
   object has information about size, atomicity type, health status, and
   underlying physical devices.

Get-PmemPhysicalDevice

   Returns one or more physical persistent memory devices. The returned
   object has information about size(s), RFIC, device location, and
   health/operational status.

New-PmemDisk

   Creates a new disk out of a given unused region. Writes out the labels
   to create the namespace, then rebuilds the SCM stacks to expose the new
   logical device.

Remove-PmemDisk

   Removes the given persistent memory disk.

Get-PmemUnusedRegion

   Returns aggregate persistent memory regions available for provisioning
   a logical device.

Initialize-PmemPhysicalDevice

   Writes zeros to the label storage area, writes new label index blocks,
   and then rebuilds the SCM stacks to reflect the changes.

Software

   This section provides an overview of the software ecosystem enabled for
   Intel DC Optane persistent memory.

Operating System Support for Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory

   Several distributions of Linux include support for both App Direct and
   Memory mode. See Operating System OS for Intel Optane DC Persistent
   Memory.

   Note: Starting with Red Hat* Enterprise Linux 7.3, technology reviews
   using persistent memory are enabled for both the Ext4 and XFS file
   systems. Please refer to Red Hat documentation for more information.

Linux Kernel Support

   The Linux NVDIMM/persistent memory drivers were enabled by default
   starting with Linux kernel 4.2. We currently recommend kernel version
   4.19 or later.

Custom Kernel

   If you compile or build custom kernels, verify that support for
   persistent memory is enabled. Here is a list of parameters you need to
   enable in the kernel configuration file, usually found under
   /boot/config -uname –r:

   (Compile or custom kernel)
     * CONFIG_ZONE_DEVICE=y
     * CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE=y
     * CONFIG_ACPI_NFIT=m
     * CONFIG_LIBNVDIMM=m
     * CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PMEM=m
     * CONFIG_ND_BLK=m
     * CONFIG_BTT=y
     * CONFIG_NVDIMM_PFN=y
     * CONFIG_NVDIMM_DAX=y
     * CONFIG_DEV_DAX_PMEM=m
     * CONFIG_FS_DAX=y

Provisioning Persistent Memory Modules through the BIOS

   Intel Optane DC memory modules can be provisioned using options
   provided in the BIOS. Please refer to support provided by your system
   vendor.

Provisioning Persistent Memory Modules through UEFI

   ipmctl can be launched from a Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
   (UEFI) shell. The same features are supported in both versions of
   ipmctl. The full list of commands can be seen by running ipmctl help
   from the command line. You need root privilege to run ipmctl.

   Note: ipmctl can be used for namespace creation and management at UEFI
   level.


Provisioning Persistent Memory Modules through Operating System

Using ipmctl

   ipmctl can be launched from a Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
   (UEFI) shell or a terminal window in an operating system. The same
   features are supported in both versions of ipmctl. The full list of
   commands can be seen by running ipmctl help from the command line. You
   need root privilege to run ipmctl.

   All the commands described in this section are demonstrated for use on
   a two-socket system with 6 terabytes (TiB) of persistent memory and 384
   gigabytes (GB) of DRAM installed.

Discovery

   Before configuring Intel Optane DC memory modules, you can discover
   current module status through a list of show commands. Figure 1 shows a
   fully populated two-socket system, commonly referred to as a 2-2-2
   configuration, with a total of twelve 32-gigabyte (GiB) DDR4 memory
   modules (DIMMs) and twelve 512 GiB Intel Optane DC persistent memory
   modules.

Show Topology

   The show -topology command displays both the Intel Optane DC persistent
   memory and DDR4 DIMMs discovered in the system by enumerating the
   SMBIOS Type 17 tables. For more information, refer to ACPI
   Specifications v6.0 or later for NFIT table information.

Show Provisioned Capacity

   To check the capacity provisioned for use in different operating modes,
   use the show -memoryresources command. The MemoryCapacity and
   AppDirectCapacity values can be used to determine if the system was
   configured in Memory mode, App Direct mode, or mixed mode. The example
   below shows that the persistent memory modules are currently configured
   in App Direct mode.
ipmctl show -memoryresources
Capacity=6031.2 GiB
MemoryCapacity=0.0 GiB
AppDirectCapacity=6024.0 GiB
UnconfiguredCapacity=0.0 GiB
InaccessibleCapacity=7.2 GiB
ReservedCapacity=0.0 GiB
ipmctl show -memoryresources
Capacity=6031.2 GiB
MemoryCapacity=0.0 GiB
AppDirectCapacity=6024.0 GiB
UnconfiguredCapacity=0.0 GiB
InaccessibleCapacity=7.2 GiB
ReservedCapacity=0.0 GiB

Provisioning With ipmctl

   Provisioning Intel Optane DC persistent memory is a two-step process.
   During this process, a goal is specified and stored on the persistent
   memory modules for the BIOS to read on the next reboot. A goal
   configures Intel Optane DC t memory modules in Memory mode, App Direct
   mode, or both.

Create a Configuration Goal

Memory Mode

   Any percentage of Intel Optane DC persistent memory module capacity
   across sockets can be provisioned in Memory mode, as described below.
   In this example, 100% of the available persistent memory capacity is to
   be provisioned in Memory mode. You can always use the -f option to
   overwrite any existing goal, which is a destructive operation.
ipmctl create -goal memorymode=100

The following configuration will be applied:
 SocketID | DimmID | MemorySize | AppDirect1Size | AppDirect2Size

App Direct Mode

   Intel Optane DC memory modules can be provisioned in App Direct mode
   with interleaving enabled or disabled. As described in the Persistent
   Memory Provisioning Concepts section above, interleaving increases the
   throughput of reads and writes to persistent memory.

   Configure App Direct Mode with Interleaved Modules

   The command below sets a goal to create a persistent memory region that
   is interleaved across all the modules on each CPU socket. Creating an
   interleaved set that spans multiple CPU sockets is not allowed. Refer
   to the following resources for more information on alternative methods:
     * Using Persistent Memory Devices with the Linux Device Mapper
     * Using Linux Volume Manager (LVM) with Persistent Memory

   The default create goal command creates an interleaved region
   configured for App Direct mode. The following two commands are
   equivalent:
ipmctl create -goal
ipmctl create -goal PersistentMemoryType=AppDirect
The following configuration will be applied:

Mixed Mode

   Intel Optane DC persistent memory can be configured such that part of
   the capacity is assigned to Memory mode and the rest to App Direct
   mode. When part or all of persistent memory module capacity is set to
   Memory mode, all the DRAM capacity is hidden from the application and
   becomes the last-level cache.

   The following example assigns 60% of the available persistent memory
   capacity to Memory mode. The rest is configured as an interleaved set
   for App Direct mode.
ipmctl create -goal Memorymode=60
The following configuration will be applied:

A reboot is required to process new memory allocation goals.

Change Configuration Goal

   When creating a goal, ipmctl checks to see whether or not the NVDIMMs
   are already configured. If so, it prints a message that the current
   configuration is to be deleted before creating a new goal.
ipmctl create -goal MemoryMode=100
Create region configuration goal failed: Error (115) - A requested DIMM already
has a configured goal. Delete this existing goal before creating a new one

ipmctl delete –goal

Dump Current Goal

ipmctl dump -destination testfile -system -config

Successfully dumped system configuration to file: testfile

Create a Goal from a Configuration File

   Goals can be provisioned using a configuration file with the load
   -source <file> -goal command. To save the current configuration to a
   file, use the dump -destination <file> -system –config command. This
   allows for the same configuration to be applied to multiple systems or
   restored to the same system.
# ipmctl dump -destination testfile -system -config
# ipmctl load -source myPath/testfile –goal

Show Current Goal

   To see the current goal, if there is one, use the show goal command.
ipmctl show -goal

There are no goal configs defined in the system.
Please use 'show -region' to display currently valid persistent memory regions.

Confirm Mode Change

   So far, we have seen how the goal can be set for different modes. Upon
   reboot, run the following commands to see if the mode is applied
   correctly. The current output shows that the goal was set to configure
   the entire capacity in Memory mode.
ipmctl show –memoryresources
Capacity=6031.2 GiB
MemoryCapacity=6024.0 GiB
AppDirectCapacity=0.0 GiB
UnconfiguredCapacity=0.0 GiB
InaccessibleCapacity=7.2 GiB
ReservedCapacity=0.0 GiB

   If the mode is changed from Memory mode to App Direct mode, upon reboot
   a single region per socket is created. If the mode is changed from App
   Direct mode to Memory mode, there are no regions created. Use the
   following command to see the regions created:
ipmctl show -region

 SocketID | ISetID             | PersistentMemoryType | Capacity   | FreeCapacit
y | HealthState
=====================================================================
 0x0000   | 0xa0927f48a8112ccc | AppDirect            | 3012.0 GiB | 3012.0 GiB

 0x0001   | 0xf6a27f48de212ccc | AppDirect            | 3012.0 GiB | 3012.0 GiB
  | Healthy

Delete Configuration

   The current configuration can be deleted by first disabling and
   destroying namespaces and then disabling the active regions.

Namespace Management in Linux

   In this section, we show how to use ndctl commands to manage
   namespaces. For more information, refer to Creating Namespaces in the
   ndctl User Guide.

List Active Namespaces

   See below for an example of how to list active namespaces.
ndctl list -N
[
  {
    "dev":"namespace0.0",
    "mode":"fsdax",
    "map":"mem",
    "size":4294967296,
    "sector_size":512,
    "blockdev":"pmem0"
  },
  {
    "dev":"namespace1.0",
    "mode":"fsdax",
    "map":"dev",
    "size":3183575302144,
    "uuid":"c8a9751c-0d5b-47ab-b45f-70fe54f7ce43",
    "sector_size":512,
    "align":2097152,
    "blockdev":"pmem1"
  }
]

Create Namespace

   The ndctl create-namespace command:
     * Creates a new namespace in fsdax mode, by default. The size of the
       namespace is the same as the region size minus size of the
       metadata. Other modes supported include sector, devdax, and raw.
     * Creates a new /dev/pmem{X[.Y]} device
          + The X value represents the region in which the namespace is
            created. This defaults to zero (0). If more than one namespace
            is created within a region, the naming convention of pmem{X.Y}
            is used, where Y represents a sequentially increasing integer
            value for the new namespace.
          + If multiple namespaces are created within a region, the first
            namespace is always created as pmem0; it does not get
            re-enumerated to pmem0.0 like subsequent namespaces.

# ndctl create-namespace
{
 "dev":"namespace0.0",
 "mode":"fsdax",
 "map":"dev",
 "size":"123.04 GiB (132.12 GB)",
 "uuid":"a60e6a4f-274d-4cd5-8d39-c8dd263345e2",
 "raw_uuid":"8d28948f-5434-4c8d-8efa-581eacad265a",
 "sector_size":512,
 "blockdev":"pmem0",
 "numa_node":0
}

   On Linux, run the following command to see if the device was created.
   Then create a DAX-enabled file system such as XFS or EXT4 on the new
   persistent memory device.
# ls -l /dev/pmem*
brw-rw----. 1 root disk 259, 0 Jul 9 10:42 /dev/pmem0

Create a 50 GiB 'fsdax' Mode Namespace

   The size value provided to ndctl includes space required for metadata,
   so the resulting available capacity for a file system will be smaller,
   as the following example shows:
# ndctl create-namespace -m fsdax -s 50G
{
 "dev":"namespace0.0",
 "mode":"fsdax",
 "map":"dev",
 "size":"49.22 GiB (52.85 GB)",
 "uuid":"638d67f3-4c18-4b2e-a6f2-a044bdc82253",
 "raw_uuid":"6c6dfdad-e12f-418d-9fb0-3a75032dd9de",
 "sector_size":512,
 "blockdev":"pmem0",
 "numa_node":0
}

   Note: If the remaining capacity needs to be assigned to another
   namespace using the same or a different mode, it can be assigned to the
   new namespace without specifying the -s <size> option. For example,
   executing ndctl create-namespace after the command above creates a new
   namespace in the same region using all remaining capacity (~78 GiB):
# ndctl create-namespace
{
 "dev":"namespace0.1",
 "mode":"fsdax",
 "map":"dev",
 "size":"73.83 GiB (79.27 GB)",
 "uuid":"d7f9473e-97aa-48cf-aefa-128797c83e88",
 "raw_uuid":"6c116e57-19dd-43d8-ae03-039f1588a23a",
 "sector_size":512,
 "blockdev":"pmem0.1",
 "numa_node":0
}

Create a Namespace with a Friendly Name (Tag)

   Tagging the namespace with a friendly name or description using the -n,
   --name option can be useful to show what a namespace is used for. This
   is particularly useful when provisioning space for multiple end users
   or applications, or to identify a namespace with for production or
   test/dev environments. Creating a namespace with a tag/name/description
   can be done as follows:
# ndctl create-namespace -n "PROD Web DB 1"
{
 "dev":"namespace0.0",
 "mode":"fsdax",
 "map":"dev",
 "size":"123.04 GiB (132.12 GB)",
 "uuid":"6a0abb59-5279-4731-921a-0099101e17f2",
 "raw_uuid":"03b40e23-56e1-407a-b5d1-f1ec929645c1",
 "sector_size":512,
 "blockdev":"pmem0",
 "name":"PROD Web DB 1",
 "numa_node":0
}

List Namespaces in a Region

ndctl list -RuN -r region1
{
  "regions":[
    {
      "dev":"region1",
      "size":"3012.00 GiB (3234.11 GB)",
      "available_size":0,
      "max_available_extent":0,
      "type":"pmem",
      "iset_id":"0xa0927f48a8112ccc",
      "persistence_domain":"memory_controller",
      "namespaces":[
        {
          "dev":"namespace1.0",
          "mode":"fsdax",
          "map":"dev",
          "size":"2964.94 GiB (3183.58 GB)",
          "uuid":"c8a9751c-0d5b-47ab-b45f-70fe54f7ce43",
          "sector_size":512,
          "align":2097152,
          "blockdev":"pmem1"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Disable Namespace

   Warning: Disabling a namespace while it is mounted or in use results in
   undefined behavior by the application(s) using the namespace. Always
   stop any applications and unmount file systems in fsdax mode before
   disabling a namespace.
ndctl disable-namespace namespace1.0
disabled 1 namespace

Destroy Namespace

   Disable namespace and destroy namespace are called to clear existing
   namespaces before creating a new goal.
ndctl destroy-namespace namespace0.0
destroyed 1 namespace

Disable Region

$ ndctl disable-region region0
disabled 1 region

Namespace Management in Windows Server

   This section is an introduction to Windows PowerShell cmdlets for
   namespace management. Refer to this link for recent updates on
   provisioning
   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/storage-spaces/
   deploy-pmem.

   PowerShell cmdlets can be used to list App Direct regions, and create,
   delete and manage namespaces.

Device Manager View

   Device Manager provides a list of persistent memory devices available
   in the system.

   device manager listing
   Figure 3. This Device Manager display example shows four Intel® Optane™
   DC memory modules
   and a persistent memory disk.

Listing Regions

   To list the regions, run the following command from PowerShell. If the
   output of this command is empty, no regions exist on the persistent
   memory modules. Recall that ipmctl is used to create regions.

   PowerShell command examples are run on a server configured in the 2:2:1
   configuration.
PS>Get-PmemUnusedRegion
PS C:\Windows\system32> Get-PmemUnusedRegion

     1           2156073582592       {1, 101, 11, 111}

   After creating regions using ipmctl and then rebooting, the newly
   created interleave sets are represented as persistent memory unused
   regions. These are the regions that are not assigned to a logical
   persistent memory device on the system.

Creating Namespaces or Persistent Memory Disk

PS> New-PmemDisk
Creating new persistent memory disk. This may take a few moments

   Windows allows a namespace to be created on a region and the capacity
   to be visible to the Windows operating system and used by applications.
   Just as an SSD can be carved into partitions, persistent memory
   namespaces represent the unit of storage that appears as a device that
   can be used for I/O.

   When the new persistent memory disk is created, go to the Computer
   Management > Storage > Disk Management console to view the new disk.
   You must initialize the disk using MBR or GPT partitioning before the
   logical disk manager can access it.

Delete Namespace

Expose Persistent Memory Regions to an Application

   We have shown how ipmctl is used to create regions, and ndctl to create
   one or more namespaces within the regions to expose persistent memory
   devices to applications.

   Though ipmctl supports creating namespaces, Intel recommends using
   vendor-agnostic tools like ndctl on Linux, and PowerShell persistent
   memory cmdlets to create and manage namespaces on Windows.

   On Linux, when a namespace is created, a persistent memory device is
   created: /dev/pmem{n}, where n starts with 0. On Windows, an entry for
   the newly created persistent memory disk appears in the Device Manager
   and Storage > Disk Management windows.

FSDAX Namespace

   File system DAX (FSDAX) mode is the default namespace mode when
   creating namespaces using ndctl. If you specify ndctl create-namespace
   with no options, it creates a device (/dev/pmemX[.Y]) that supports the
   DAX capabilities of Linux file systems. Both XFS and EXT4 support the
   DAX feature. DAX removes the page cache from the I/O path and allows
   mmap(2) to establish direct mappings to persistent memory media.

   As shown in the diagram below, when persistent memory modules are
   configured in FSDAX mode, applications have the ability to: 1) memory
   map a file on a DAX mounted file system then perform direct load and
   store access to persistent memory region, or 2) continue to use
   standard file APIs, which require no changes to the application.

   persistent memory in f s d a x mode

   To mount a DAX-enabled file system, we use the –o dax mount option. The
   following commands show the process of configuring the persistent
   memory modules for App Direct using ipmctl, then creating a single
   namespace on one of the regions, and finally creating and mounting the
   DAX enabled file system. Run the commands shown in the example below as
   root.
1.      Create goal to create a region in App Direct mode on reboot
        a.      ipmctl create –goal PersistentMemoryType=AppDirect
2.      Show goal
        a.      ipmctl show -goal
3.      Reboot
        a.      ndctl create-namespace -r region2
4.      Create namespace using ndctl. Default mode is fsdax.
        ndctl create-namespace
        {
        "dev":"namespace2.0",
        "mode":"fsdax",
        "map":"dev",
        "size":"2964.94 GiB (3183.58 GB)",
        "uuid":"41d252c8-55b3-4683-989a-d131e8136870",
        "sector_size":512,
        "align":2097152,
        "blockdev":"pmem2"
        }
5.      Check out the pmem device created
        a.      ls -l /dev/pmem*
6.      Create filesystem and mount it on the pmem device
        a.      mkfs.ext4 -f /dev/pmem<x>
7.      Create a directory
        a.      mkdir /mnt/mypmem
8.      Mount filesystem with -o dax option
        a.      mount -o dax /dev/pmem<x> /mnt/mypmem
9.      Create a file on the file system and memory map it

Sector Mode Namespace (Storage over App Direct)

   For file systems or applications that use a traditional storage API,
   create a namespace with sector mode.

   Persistent memory-based storage can perform I/O at byte, or more
   accurately, cache line granularity. However, exposing such storage as a
   traditional block device does not guarantee atomicity and requires the
   block drivers for persistent memory to provide this support.

   Traditional SSDs typically provide protection against torn sectors in
   hardware, to complete in-flight block writes. Whereas, if a persistent
   memory write is in progress and a power failure happens, the block may
   contain a mix of old and new data. Existing applications may not be
   prepared to handle such a scenario since they are unlikely to protect
   against torn sectors or metadata.

   The Block Translation Table (BTT) provides atomic sector update
   semantics for persistent memory devices so that applications that rely
   on sector writes not being torn can continue to do so.

   As shown in the diagram below, the BTT manifests itself as a stacked
   block device and reserves a portion of the underlying storage for its
   metadata. At the heart of it is an indirection table that re-maps all
   of the blocks on the volume. It can be thought of as an extremely
   simple file system that only provides atomic sector updates. The DAX
   feature is not supported in this mode.

   app direct region

   In the example shown below, the default sector size used is 4 KB.
   Sector atomicity is provided by kernel drivers.

Commands to Create Persistent Storage over App Direct

1.      Create goal using ipmctl command
        o        ipmctl create –goal PersistentMemoryType=AppDirect
2.      Show goal
        o       # ipmctl show -goal
3.      Reboot
4.      Create namespace with sector mode using ndctl
        5.      # ndctl create-namespace -m sector
                {

Configure Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory in Virtualized Environments

   Documentation for virtualized and container environments is provided by
   the software vendor. These are links to virtualization technologies
   that support persistent memory:
     * VMware* vSphere
     * KVM/QEMU
     * Hyper-V
     * Kubernetes*
          + Persistent Memory Container Storage Interface (PMEM-CSI) is a
            storage driver for container orchestrators like Kubernetes. It
            makes Intel Optane DC persistent memory available as a file
            system volume to container applications. For more information,
            read Persistent Memory-Container Storage Interface for
            Kubernetes.

Emulate Persistent Memory

   If you are a software developer who wants to get started developing
   software or modifying an application to have persistent memory
   awareness, but you do not have access to a system with persistent
   memory hardware, it is possible to emulate it. Emulation is not
   intended for performance or benchmarking as it cannot simulate the
   performance characteristics. Several approaches used to emulate
   persistent memory are described below.

Using System DRAM

   The article How to Emulate Persistent Memory Using Dynamic
   Random-access Memory (DRAM) describes the requirements and steps for
   using system DRAM to emulate persistent memory. This approach does not
   provide persistent storage characteristics. When the system is
   rebooted, all the configuration and data is lost.

Using KVM/QEMU

   KVM and QEMU can be used to create virtual machines that run their own
   dedicated operating system and persistent memory regions. This approach
   allows the guest virtual machines (VMs) to use ndctl as if they had
   access to persistent memory. The host can provide persistent storage
   behavior by mapping the persistent memory devices from a non-volatile
   storage device such as an SSD. This approach most closely matches that
   of real persistent memory hardware.

   On a host system with persistent memory, it is possible to directly
   assign a persistent memory device or file residing on a DAX mounted
   file system to the guest, and for that guest to mount the device with
   DAX support.

   Refer to Using QEMU Virtualization for more information.

Frequently Asked Questions on Provisioning

   This section describes some of the issues and messages that are
   commonly seen when configuring Intel Optane DC persistent memory.

   When I configure in App Direct mode, why do I see part of the capacity
          as “Inaccessible” and “Unconfigured”?
          Intel DC Optane persistent memory reserves a certain amount of
          capacity for metadata. For first-generation Intel Optane DC
          persistent memory, it is approximately 0.5% per DIMM.

          Unconfigured capacity is the capacity that is not mapped into
          the system’s physical address space. It could also be the
          capacity that is inaccessible because the processor does not
          support the entire capacity on the platform.

ipmctl show -memoryresources

Capacity=6031.2 GiB
MemoryCapacity=0.0 GiB
AppDirectCapacity=6024.0 GiB
UnconfiguredCapacity=0.0 GiB
InaccessibleCapacity=7.2 GiB
ReservedCapacity=0.0 GiB

   How do I find the firmware version on the modules?

ipmctl show -dimm
 DimmID | Capacity  | HealthState | ActionRequired | LockState | FWVersion
==============================================================================
 0x0001 | 502.6 GiB | Healthy         | 0                            |

   My processor does not allow me to configure the entire Intel Optane DC
          memory module capacity on the platform. How do I find out
          maximum supported capacity on the processor?
          Run the following command to display the maximum amount of
          memory that is allowed to be mapped into the system physical
          address space for this processor based on the processor SKU. For
          more information on the capacity supported by the processor SKU
          on your platform, run the following commands:

ipmctl show -d TotalMappedMemory -socket
---SocketID=0x0000---
   TotalMappedMemory=3203.0 GiB
---SocketID=0x0001---
   TotalMappedMemory=3202.5 GiB

   How do I unlock the encrypted modules?
          The ability to enable security, unlock a persistent memory
          region, and change passphrase is enabled in both the Linux
          kernel driver 5.0 and is also available in ndctl.

   Does Intel Optane DC persistent memory support SMART errors?
          Yes.

   How do I find a module’s lifetime?
          The remaining persistent memory module life as a percentage
          value of factory-expected life span can be found by running the
          following command:

ipmctl show -o text -sensor percentageremaining -dimm
 DimmID | Type                | CurrentValue | CurrentState
============================================================
 0x0001 | PercentageRemaining | 100%         | Normal
 0x0011 | PercentageRemaining | 100%         | Normal
 0x0021 | PercentageRemaining | 100%         | Normal

   When configured in Mixed mode, is the DRAM capacity seen by the
          operating system and applications?
          No. When part of the capacity is configured in Memory mode, DRAM
          is hidden from the operating System and the capacity configured
          in Memory mode becomes the volatile capacity for the capacity
          configured in App Direct mode.

   I am adding 2 new DIMMs and would like to erase all the existing
          configurations and safely reconfigure the hardware but was
          unable to delete regions.
          To create a new configuration, you need to delete the existing
          goal and create a new one as shown below. There is no need to
          delete regions. Create-goal -f will overwrite the existing goal
          and on reboot you will see the new goal.

1.      ndctl destroy-namespace namespace0.0
or
ndctl destroy-namespace -f all
2.      ipmctl delete -goal
Delete memory allocation goal from DIMM 0x0001: Success
Delete memory allocation goal from DIMM 0x0011: Success
Delete memory allocation goal from DIMM 0x0101: Success
Delete memory allocation goal from DIMM 0x0111: Success
3.      ipmctl create -f -goal persistentmemorytype=appdirect

   Why am I seeing a certain amount of capacity shown as reserved?
          Reserved capacity is total system Intel Optane DC persistent
          memory capacity that is reserved. This capacity is the
          persistent memory partition capacity (rounded down for
          alignment) less any App Direct capacity. Reserved capacity
          typically results from a Memory Allocation Goal request that
          specified the Reserved property. This capacity is not mapped to
          system physical address (SPA) space.

          For a comprehensive list of debugging and troubleshooting
          commands, refer to the list of debugging and troubleshooting
          options listed in Appendix A

   What is the list of supported configurations and what happens if I am
          not using one of these configurations
          A list of validated and popular configurations are provided in
          the System Requirements section of this document. Other
          configurations are likely to  not be supported by the BIOS and
          may not boot.

Managing Namespaces

   For troubleshooting namespace configuration issues with ndctl, refer to
   the following guides:
     * Linux: The ndctl User Guide.
     * Windows Server: Storage-class Memory (NVDIMM-N) Health Management
       in Windows.

Summary

   This quick start guide describes methods to provision Intel Optane DC
   persistent memory modules using ipmctl and operating system
   specific persistent memory vendor-neutral utilities. ipmctl is
   necessary for discovering Intel Optane DC memory module resources,
   creating goals and regions, updating the firmware, and debugging issues
   with these persistent memory modules. Learn more about each of these
   tools and get started with persistent memory programming at Intel®
   Developer Zone (Intel® DZ) – Persistent Memory.

   Don't forget to sudo! Otherwise the user privilage would not let you
   see NVDIMMs:

     lab@clx:~$ ipmctl show -topology

     No DIMMs in the system.

   Compare:

   General Site Issues FAQ

You've got questions, we've got answers!

   Take a look at the top questions asked on the Intel® Developer Zone and
   see if yours is already answered. Don't see your question? You can

   What is the Intel® Developer Zone?
          The Intel® Developer Zone is a global site designed to engage
          the software community with insights, information, expertise,
          and tools to help drive innovation and success among developers
          who work in the Intel software environment. The program provides
          opportunities for members to connect and collaborate, share
          knowledge, learn, and grow professionally. In addition, members
          have access to a wide variety of opportunities to market and
          sell their software and apps directly to consumers, as well as
          tap into promotional and funding opportunities to help them grow
          their businesses.

          Evolving technologies, growing customer expectations, and
          heightened consumer experiences—the business of creating
          best-selling software and popular apps changes from day to day.
          The Intel Developer Zone provides the perspective and resources
          software professionals need to plan for and react to these
          shifts.

   Intel makes processors—how does that relate to software?
          Intel® processors power a huge range of devices—from Macs* and
          PCs to smartphones, tablets, and OEM devices. As a result, we
          need to pay attention to the software that runs on those devices
          in our constant pursuit of better user experiences. This puts
          Intel in a unique position to help developers make the most of
          their efforts across a variety of form factors, operating
          systems, and platforms.

   Who uses the Intel Developer Zone?
          The Intel Developer Zone was created for software professionals
          engaged in creating, developing, marketing, selling, and
          distributing software and apps. Our website provides development
          support, software resources, and market opportunities to
          everyone from seasoned developers and global software businesses
          to students and software startups.

   Is this a worldwide program?
          Yes. The program provides opportunities to sell and distribute
          software and apps directly to customers in 45 countries and
          provides access to content in English, Spanish, French, Italian,
          German, Russian, Portuguese, and Chinese. In addition,
          developers can connect and collaborate with Intel experts
          worldwide and engage with a community of peers, students, and
          educators from over 150 countries to share development advice
          and business opportunities, answer questions, and gather
          information on new platforms, technologies, and techniques.

   How does registration work?
          A developer can register to post comments to forums and access a
          variety of technical content and resources. Additional
          requirements to access premium business resources may apply.

   Does it cost anything to join?
          No. There are no costs to join the program or to access nearly
          all of our resources.

   What is the Intel login?
          Before you create a new login ID, you should know that many
          Intel systems allow you to use the same login ID. For example:

          + If you have registered any Intel® Software Development
            Products (i.e., Intel® VTune™ Performance Analyzer), then use
            your Intel® Registration Center login ID.
          + If you have submitted a support request using Intel Premier
            Support, then you should already have a login ID.
          + If you are a member of the Intel Software Partner Program,
            then you should already have a login ID.

          If you think you already have an account, here are some useful
          links:

          + Log in with your existing login ID
          + Enter your email address and get your login ID
          + Enter your login ID and get your password
          + Sign In FAQ

   What are the Intel password guidelines?
          The following password rules are for both the Registration
          Center and for Premier Support.

          + The password must be at least eight characters long, and can
            contain letters, numbers, and punctuation.
          + It must not exceed fourteen (14) characters.
          + It must contain at least one alpha character [a-z; A-Z], one
            numeric [0-9] and one special character [`!
            @$%^&*()-_=+[];:'",<.>/?].
          + It cannot contain spaces.
          + The password cannot be the same as any of your previous eight
            (8) passwords.
          + It cannot contain your login id.
          + It may not contain any of the following special characters:
            Asterisk (*) Comma (,) Backslash (\) Forward Slash (/).

          It must not:

          + Be a name (your own, family members, pets, or famous people).
          + Be your social security number, driver's license number,
            passport number, or some other identification number.
          + Have repeating numbers, letters, or characters (111111,
            aaaaaa, !!!!!!).
          + Be a number or character combination that is next to each
            other on the keyboard (123456, asdfgh).
          + Be a dictionary word of any language.
          + Begin with an exclamation point (!) or question mark (?).
          + Have the same first three characters.

   for general information only and should not be relied upon as complete
   or accurate.
   Sorry, we can't translate this content right now, please try again
   later.

Step 1: Make a bootable micro SD card

   You must boot your Intel® Galileo board using a micro SD card that
   contains the latest Intel® IoT Developer Kit version of the
   Yocto*-built Linux image.

   Linux is the operating system that powers the Intel® Galileo board.
   While there is already a version of Linux built into your board, the
   developer-kit version of Yocto-built Linux includes even more libraries
   and resources to help developers create applications in their favorite
   programming language. This version includes GCC, Python, Node.js,
   OpenCV, to name a few.

   In addition, sketches that you upload to the Intel® Galileo board are
   erased when the board is powered down. To be able to resume the sketch
   even after powering down your board, you must boot from a micro SD
   card.

Requirements

   You must have a few things to begin. The steps below are for creating a
   micro SD card with a Windows* host system. There are separate
   instructions for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.

Method 1: Run the integrated installer

   Download and run the latest version of the Intel® Galileo Windows
   64-bit Arduino* Installer from the Intel® Galileo Board Downloads page.

   The integrated installer will install the Arduino IDE, as well as
   download the needed Win32 Disk Imager software to write to your SD
   card. It will not write to the SD card for you, but it will install the
   imaging software and leave it for you to finish the process. If you get
   stuck, refer to Method 2 below.

   End-user license

   Third-party program use

Method 2: Manual Process

   This section contains steps to download and extract the latest
   developer kit version of the Linux image.
    1. Download and install the 7-Zip file archiver from 7-Zip.org.
    2. Download the latest Intel® Galileo Board micro SD Card Linux*
       Operating System Image from the Intel® Galileo Board Downloads
       page.
    3. Use 7-Zip to extract the .bz2 file to your system. You must use
       7-Zip to extract the image, as it supports the extended file paths
       found in the compressed image file.
       You should now have a file called
       iot-devkit-version-mmcblkp0.direct alongside the original .bz2
       file, where version is either latest or a date in the YYYYMMDDHHMM
       format.

Write the image to your micro SD card

   This section contains steps to write the image to your micro SD card.
    1. Visit http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager and click the
       Download button to save the latest
       Win32DiskImager-version-binary.zip file to your system.
    2. Insert the micro SD card into your card reader.
    3. Run Win32 Disk Imager as an Administrator, as follows:
         1. Double-click Win32DiskImager-binary.zip to expand its
            contents.
         2. Open the Win32DiskImager-binary folder.
         3. Right-click Win32DiskImager.exe, then select Run as
            administrator.
    4. In Win32 Disk Imager, click the folder icon on the top right.
       Click the folder icon to browse for the Yocto image.
    5. In the file type drop-down list, select *.* so you can see all
       files, regardless of file extension.
       Select *.* to see all files, regardless of extension.
    6. Navigate to and select the .direct file that you extracted earlier,
       then click Open.
    7. From the Device drop-down list, select the device drive of your
       micro SD card.
       Caution: Be sure to select the correct device drive, as the drive
       letter for your card may be different on your system. Selecting the
       wrong drive letter could result in erasing your data on the wrong
       drive.
       Select the drive letter for your SD card.
    8. Click Write, then wait for the write process to finish. Please be
       patient, as this may take up to 5 minutes.
    9. After completing the write process, click Exit to close Win32 Disk
       Imager. Once the write process is complete, your bootable micro SD
       card should contain the following:
          + boot
          + firmware
          + win-driver
          + bzImage
   10. Eject and remove the micro SD card from your card reader.
   11. You can now insert the card into the micro SD card slot on your
       Intel Galileo board. When you power up your board, the board
       automatically boots using the image on the card.


   Now that you have created your bootable card, continue to assemble and
   power your board. If you want to get going quickly in Arduino, skip to
   installing the Arduino IDE.
   For more complete information about compiler optimizations, see our
   Optimization Notice.
