Faith, Love and Respect for ALL

About

   Hello friends, it is nice to see you again. I know it has been much too
   long since I have shared anything with you. I am sorry for my absence,
   but as usual life has been crazy and time tends to just get away from
   me.

   Amidst the craziness, I have been working on a new blog, which is still
   a work in progress, but has been launched nonetheless. The
   Jest_Tu_Positive Life ^© is where the majority of my future posts will
   be. At this point I am not sure if this blog will remain separate, or
   be merged with the new one. The only thing I am certain of, is that
   although Autism adds color to all aspects in our life, it is not the
   center of it, so I want to put it in it’s proverbial place. Our family
   may be different, but we are also very similar to all the other
   families in the world; therefore, the new blog with focus on life in
   general, with our Autistic Attributes interwoven for a taste of the
   rainbow that lights our journey.

   If you would like to read about the new page, please visit the About
   page, hosted by WordPress, or our Facebook page. I pray that you will
   join us on this new path in our journey, which is is based on Faith,
   Love and Respect for ALL. We Accept and Celebrate everyone for the
   Unique and Diverse Human Beings they are, and hope that we can help
   others see life in a more positive manner, and be proud of the amazing
   individuals they are.

       LOVE the duct tape weighted blanket and would love to make one for
       my grandson who is 3 and level 3 on the spectrum. My question
       is……..is the duct tape rigid enough to keep the rice from pocketing
       at the bottom of the ziplock bag or does it need to be “resettled”
       every time it is held in a vertical position……..hope that makes
       sense. LOL Love your site and being his diagnosis is just a year
       old we still have to much to learn. Thank you for your time and
       caring.

            We used to shake ours a bit, but I don’t remember it settling
            too much. My daughter didn’t like the feel of the duct tape,
            so we always kept ours in a pillow case. When Beth was 3, the
            weighted blanket was a life saver for us, I pray it helps your
            grandson.

            I am sorry about the delay in my response, Alison, I have been
            offline for a few months. I do not make weighted blankets, but
            I can recommend the place we buy ours from. The customer
            service is phenomenal and the quality is amazing.
