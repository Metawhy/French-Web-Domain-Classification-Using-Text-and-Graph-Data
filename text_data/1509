   We categorise calls by type (debt collection, serious number,
   sweepstakes, etc.) and give the number in question a tellows score,
   which indicates whether a number is trustworthy or suspicious, helping
   you to decide whether or not to take the call.

   wonder: You is calling? Thousands of people suffer the same fate.
   Hence, za.tellows.net wants to contribute a tool to fight spam and scam
   calls. The fraudulant entrepreneurs behind the nuisance calls are

Where does the information on telephone numbers come from?

   The distribution of information on scam and spam methods is vital to
   oppose the leaching of people's purses. To achieve this goal tellows is
   aggregating a vast bulk of useful information on the caller, including
   his or her approximate location. The key indicator of a number's
   trustworthiness is the tellows score which is generated through a
   complex algorithm fed by your comments and ratings of the respective
   phone numbers. Hence, the success of this anti-fraud endeavour goes
   hand in glove with the community's participation. If you have
   experience on the matter, share it and warn your fellows before the
   scammers drain their pocket dry.
