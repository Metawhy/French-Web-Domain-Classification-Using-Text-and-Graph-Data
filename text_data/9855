Testimonials

     * "I was just poking around on the internet, trying to find fun and
       exciting ways for my husband and I to spend some time together when
       I found your wonderful website! Wow! I printed off so many great
       ideas and I just can't wait to try them. Thanks so much for making
       these items free and easy to access."
       Melissa B.
     * "I love your calendars! I could spend forever browsing for date
       ideas but I love that this gives you a whole month’s worth of
       suggestions. I also really like the mix of dates, only one out on
       the town, as well as an intimate one. Thank you so much for all
       that you do, I wish more people placed such a high value on
       marriage."
       Laura S.
     * "I just wanted to say that I have LOVED your 7 Days of Love
       program. I have been dating my boyfriend for a few years now and
       actually modified your program a little to have it lead up to our
       weekend getaway! I really love when people are willing to share
       wonderful things like this for free. You guys are amazing!"
       Tara Z.
     * "Today has been a really rough day for both me and my hubby. I
       decided to look on your site to find some cute date ideas for our
       date night and I came across Sarina's video idea for your hubby and
       I had so much fun making it and reflecting on our marriage!! I am
       excited to see my husband's reaction to it! Thanks, ladies, for
       helping me!"
       Nicole D.
     * "Thank you so much! My boyfriend is in the military and I end up
       making him packages with the ideas you have and then planning a
       weekend of cute romance when he comes home! I LOVE everything you
       put up here! It has helped us keep our relationship strong through
       all the separations! Thank you so, SO much for everything!"
       Madison E.
     * "I just want to sincerely thank you for your website! I was
       recently married a few months ago and I just stumbled upon the
       "Free Love Calendar." I have been following it to a 'T' and it has
       been SO much fun! Both my hubby and I love it, really keeps things
       fresh and changes things up. LOVE THEM! Thanks so much."
       Michelle W.
     * "I appreciate the exceptional customer service! I don't think I've
       ever had a company follow-up on a purchase, let alone do it
       personally. I am a stickler on customer service and I wanted to let
       you know how happy I am! Thanks again! What you guys provide is so
       wonderful! It's really an ingenious idea!"
       Rachel M.
     * "Thanks so much for all the wonderful products and ideas Dating
       Divas! I purchased and printed Year of Dates Binders for my three
       grown kids for Christmas and they all loved them. They all now
       visit your site continuously!!! My husband and I are also starting
       a monthly group date with some of our friends! Thanks again!"
       Sally T.
     * "Y'all are AMAZING!!!! I'm going into my second marriage and I'm
       committed to working at this marriage more actively! I'm SO
       grateful for the fun blog posts and products on your site! Your
       date night and intimacy ideas are going to help with our marriage
       so much. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!"
       Jennifer A.
     * I originally found Dating Divas on Pinterest, and now I receive
       emails from y'all. I have been married for 37 years to a great guy
       I only dated for 7 months!! Not always easy, but well worth the
       effort. Fresh ideas are much appreciated especially when you're
       older; keeps that little spark going! Thank you!!
       Barbara L.
     * My husband and I have been married almost 14 years and after adding
       2 kids and a full time job to the mix, I have struggled in finding
       ways to make sure he knows that he is still my top priority. I did
       the 7 Days of Love the week of Valentines and he LOVED it! Thank
       you for putting that excitement back in the mix!!!
