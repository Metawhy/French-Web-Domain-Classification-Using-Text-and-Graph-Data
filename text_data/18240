MEET CARRIE

   Carrie Kerskie is a highly sought-after national speaker, trainer,
   author and consultant on the topics of identity theft, fraud and data
   privacy. She has presented at over 300 conferences, professional and
   civic organizational meetings, professional development and corporate

   AgingCare.com and Naples Daily News.

   Carrie is an identity theft victim advocate. For nearly fifteen years
   Carrie has  restored the identity of thousands of identity theft
   victims. This led to her discovery of a proprietary process preventing
   or minimizing the threat of identity theft. This process has been
   tested with her clients with proven results.

   RECOGNITION FOR HER DEDICATION

   In 2017 the Collier Citizens Council presented Carrie with the
   inaugural Murray Hendel Civic Achievement award. The award honors
   individuals who have made extraordinary contributions to the community
   of Naples, Florida.

   In 2015 Carrie was the driving force behind strengthening Florida’s
   identity theft laws including making business identity theft a crime in
   the state.

   In 2014 Congressman Diaz-Balart lauded Carrie with a Congressional
   Record for her work on identity theft.
