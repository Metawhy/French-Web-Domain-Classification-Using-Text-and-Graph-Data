   For those of you who have visited Tweaking4All more often, you might
   have noticed that I really like Lazarus Pascal. I use it to develop
   little freeware applications for multiple platforms (if possible), like
   for Windows, MacOS X and Linux.

   So why not on a Raspberry Pi (Raspbian)? Lazarus allows Rapid
   Application Development in the good old Delphi style which would be
   ideal for a platform like the Raspberry Pi. Specially since
   the Raspberry Pi  2 Model B seems to be fast enough as well.

   Now me and my brother-in-law (Jean-Pierre) are planning to build an
   Alarm system based on a Raspberry Pi 2, use a TouchScreen and plenty of
   sensor. Lazarus Pascal could be ideal for this purpose.

   To my disappointment, it took me a lot of time to get Lazarus to run on
   my new Raspberry Pi 2 Model B … so that’s why I wrote this article,
   which is basically a compilation of a lot of steps that I found
   scattered all over the Internet.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [INS: :INS]

Why Lazarus Pascal?

   Lazarus Pascal a free Delphi look-a-like and compatible Pascal
   development environment based on FPC (Free Pascal Compiler).

   I can highly recommend it, specially when you’ve been a Delphi fan or
   when you’d like to do cross platform application development with
   Pascal. I’m a Pascal fan, and love the way it’s done in Lazarus and
   Delphi. It’s powerful and allows for very quick development of
   applications.

   You would think that Lazarus/FPC would be ideal for developing apps for
   a Raspberry Pi,… right?
   [INS: :INS]

What seems to be the problem?

   Well, for older Raspberry Pi models (different CPU), one could use
   “apt-get” (even though that results in an antiquated version) to get
   all we need. As the Lazarus Pascal Wiki describes:


   1
   2
   3
   4
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get upgrade
   sudo apt-get install fpc
   sudo apt-get install lazarus

   On a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B however, this does NOT work – you will get
   all kinds of error messages.

   This is could be (but I’m not an expert) caused by the differences in
   CPU – see also this comparison chart. The previous Raspberry Pi models
   (A, B, B+) use a Broadcom BCM2835 chip which uses a ARMv6 single core
   CPU. The newer Raspberry Pi 2 model however uses a Broadcom BCM2836
   chip with a ARMv7 quad core CPU.

   Again: I’m not an expert … I just know the regular Raspberry Pi method
   fails …

   I’ve learned a lot from this article “Raspberry Pi 2, FreePascal,
   Lazarus and Delphi” and have modified steps from his guide based on my
   own experiences and my own purposes. So much of the credits go to Simon
   Stuart for the work he has done! Without his article I would have spend
   even more than the 2 full days I’ve spent so far getting FPC
   and Lazarus to compile for the first time. But please note that my
   steps are not identical to Simon’s guide – so do not mix both articles.

   I’ve collected more information from several websites, listed at the
   end of this article.

Lazarus Pascal on Raspberry Pi 2 Model B

     Keep in mind: This article was written ONLY FOR THE RASPBERRY PI 2
   Model B.

   I’ll explain step for step how I have done things to get to a point
   where I can develop applications in Lazarus Pascal – follow the steps
   carefully and it should work OK.

   I’ve run through my steps numerous times, and if you follow each step
   as described, you too should end up with a working FPC and Lazarus on
   your Raspberry Pi 2.

Do I have a Raspberry Pi 2?

   The most confusing thing (for me anyway) is the naming of the Raspberry
   Pi 2 (a.k.a. Raspberry Pi 2 Model B) – it sounds a lot like the
   Raspberry Pi Model B and looks a lot like it too, so pay attention …

   A few pointers to identify the Raspberry Pi 2:
     * 4 USB slots (most older models have only 2)
     * Ethernet connector
     * No composite video output (yellow RCA seen on older models)
     * The big chip on top should say “BroadCom BMC2836“
     * There should be a big memory chip on the backside of the PCB
     * Below the GPIO connector it should say something like “Raspberry Pi
       2 Model B“


   You can also use cat /proc/cpuinfo  from the command line.
   The output should show 4 blocks (one for each core), each with
   something like this:


   processor   : 0
   model name  : ARMv7 Processor rev 5 (v7l)
   BogoMIPS    : 38.40
   Features    : half thumb fastmult vfp edsp neon vfpv3 tls vfpv4 idiva
   idivt vfpd32 lpae evtstrm
   CPU implementer : 0x41
   CPU architecture: 7
   CPU variant : 0x0
   CPU part    : 0xc07
   CPU revision    : 5


   Raspberry Pi 2

   Raspberry Pi 2

What do we need …?

   Obviously we need a Raspberry Pi 2, the one with the quad core ARM
   based Broadcom chip.

   We also need a 16 Gb or larger micro SD card (8 Gb worked for me with
   Wheezy, but other users have ran into space issues with newer versions
   – Thx Bosseb!).
   Probably good to look for a faster model (at least a Class 10 – see
   SD-Card.org).

   For this process you’ll need a HDMI capable monitor or HDMI capable TV,
   and at least a USB keyboard.
   A USB mouse is in the first steps not needed, but definitely required
   for using Lazarus by itself, unless you’re planning on using
   remote-access (VNC).

   We will need Internet access for which I highly recommend using a wired
   Ethernet connection – USB WiFi dongles on the Raspberry Pi are
   notoriously known to be super slow and drop a lot of packets. I would
   definitely NOT use WiFi. It will become highly annoying and unreliable
   very fast!

   After collecting those items, we need to downloaded the latest RaspBian
   image from the Raspberry Pi download page, the described steps might
   work for other distro’s as well, but I have not tested that. I’ve been
   working with RaspBian Wheezy.

   In the steps to follow we will install a few packages, subversion, FPC
   and of course the Lazarus Pascal IDE.

     Note: this process will take about 2 hours …!

Preparing the Raspberry Pi to get started with Lazarus Pascal

   These are the steps we will execute:
     * Step 1 – Flash RaspBian to your SD-Card
     * Step 2 – First Boot Configuration for RaspBian
     * Step 3 – Some initial tweaking
     * Step 4 – Getting the latest FPC (Free Pascal Compiler)
     * Step 5 – Install the Lazarus Pascal IDE
     * Step 6 – Going to the Desktop (Remote Access, Direct Access)
     * Step 8 – Running Lazarus the First Time


Step 1 – Flash RaspBian to your SD-Card

   Like I said before, we first need to download the latest RaspBian image
   (ZIPPED IMG file) from the Raspberry Pi download page.

   Next step is to install that image on our SD-card. Read the article
   “Raspberry Pi – How to get an Operating System on a SD-Card” how to do
   this – it relatively easy. Note that Rasbian is typically downloaded as
   a ZIP file and unzipping that file before proceeding might be needed,
   unless you use v1.6 of ApplePi-Baker (MacOS X only).

   To jump directly to the section relevant for you:
     * Windows users
     * MacOS X users
     * Linux users


Step 2 – First Boot Configuration for RaspBian

   After flashing the SD card, time to place it into your Raspberry Pi 2
   and boot for the first time.
   Hookup your monitor or TV, and you’ll need at least an USB keyboard
   connected for this procedure and finally connect the powersupply (this
   can be any 2A or better Android charger).

   During the initial boot you’ll see some text flying by, never mind
   that.
   After a few seconds you’ll see the initial RaspBian configuration
   screen.

    Note : Do NOT enable booting into the desktop just yet! It takes away
   too much memory for compiling FPC/Lazarus.

   In this screen use the   Arrow Up and   Arrow Down key to go through
   the options, and use the ENTER key to select.

   Once you’ve done all the settings use the   Arrow Right or   Arrow Left
   key to go to the “Finish” option.

   In the next steps we will:
    1. expand the filesystem,
    2. change the user password,
    3. overclock the Raspberry Pi,
    4. enable SSH and
    5. reboot the Raspberry Pi  ….


 Expand Filesystem (required)

   This is the basic step we all do: maximize the filesystem so that our
   entire SD card is being utilized.

   Select “1 Expand Filesystem” and press ENTER.
   RaspBian - Expand FileSystem

   RaspBian – Expand FileSystem

   Some text will fly by, and a window will appear confirming that the
   filesystem has been expanded. Click “OK“.

 Change the user password (optional)

   This step is optional.
   The default username is “pi” and the default password is “raspberry”
   (without the quotes).

   I changed mine to an even simpeler password, but that’s completely up
   to you.

   Select “2 Change User Password” and press ENTER.
   RaspBian - Change User Password

   RaspBian – Change User Password

   You will be prompted (at the bottom of the screen) to enter the new
   password twice and after that a confirmation will show that the
   password has been changed. I’m not even sure if this is possible, but
   I’d avoid an empty password.

 Overclock your Raspberry Pi (optional)

   I’m not a big fan of overclocking, but in this case we can make a
   relatively safe overclock.
   The compiling process we will start will chew a lot of resource, so a
   few extra MHz could be beneficial.

CAUTION with OVERCLOCKING

   Overclocking your Raspberry Pi might give a nice speed boost, but be
   very aware that it might reduce the life span of your Raspberry Pi. At
   higher speeds, your Raspberry Pi will get hotter! Proper cooling would
   be a good thing to do.

   I have had good experiences with settings up to and including “Medium”.
   But this does not mean that it will work fine for your Raspberry Pi as
   well.

   Overclock at your own risk!

   Select “7 Overclock” and press ENTER.
   RaspBian - Overclocking

   RaspBian – Overclocking

   After a warning message, you can select the amount of overclocking you
   prefer.
   The maximum overclock I would consider “safe” is the “Medium” setting –
   I’d avoid anything above that, even though your Raspberry Pi might work
   just fine with higher settings. Overclocking is always at your own
   risk!
   Raspberry Pi - Overclocking Options

   Raspberry Pi – Overclocking Options

 Enable SSH access (required)

   For the steps following we will need SSH access, since we will do most
   of the work in an SSH Shell.

   Select “8 Advanced Options” and press ENTER.
   RaspBian - Advanced Options

   RaspBian – Advanced Options

   In the next window select “A4 SSH” and press ENTER.
   RaspBian - Enable SSH access

   RaspBian – Enable SSH access

   In the next window, select “Enable” to actually enable SSH.

 Completing RaspBian configuration (required)

   Once you’ve done all the settings use the   Arrow Right or   Arrow Left
   key to go to the “Finish” option and reboot.

Step 3 – Some initial Tweaking

   In this step we will:
    1. Disable the boot rainbow,
    2. Increase Swap File Size,
    3. Find the IP address of our Raspberry Pi (for SSH access).


   These steps can be executed in the command line directly.
   However, when you already know the IP Address of your Raspberry Pi and
   you have already shell access through SSH, then you can most certainly
   execute them there as well. In that scenario you can of course skip the
   “Find the IP Address” step …

 Remove SplashScreen Rainbow at boot (optional)

   I personally am not a fan of the rainbow that appears during boot, so
   with a little trick we can remove this.
   Raspberry Pi - Disable boot rainbow

   Raspberry Pi – Disable boot rainbow

   In the command line of your Raspberry pi, we can edit the configuration
   file for this, which is found on the directory called “/boot/” where we
   will find a file called “config.txt“. We can use Nano to edit this
   file:


   sudo nano /boot/config.txt

   At the end of this file, we will add an extra line to disable the
   rainbow (for more options see the config.txt documentation):


   disable_splash=1

   After adding this line, save it and close the text editor. This can be
   done with CTRL+X, press “y”, and press ENTER.

 Increase the swap file size (required)

   Since we need extra memory for the compiling process, we temporary up
   the swap size of RaspBian.
   We can use NANO to edit the swap file size.


   sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile

   There will be only one line in this file, change it so it reads:


   CONF_SWAPSIZE=500

   Once modified, press CTRL+X to close Nano. It will ask if you want to
   save it (press “y”) and confirm the filename (press ENTER).

“can’t call the assembler, error -1”

   When recompiling the Lazarus IDE at a later time, you could run into
   this error. In this case it indicates that we’re running out of memory.

   In the rare ocassion that this happens (I was installing BRGAControls),
   up the swap value even more:

   CONF_SWAPSIZE=1000


       Determine the IP address of your Raspberry Pi for SSH access (required)

   To be able to use SSH, we will need to know the IP Address of the
   Raspberry Pi – you could try using the [default] device network name
   “raspberrypi” but it failed in my setup.

     Make sure you’ve connected the Ethernet of your Raspberry Pi before
   continuing.

SSH needed for this project …

   All the following steps have been done with SSH (until the point where
   I switch to starting Lazarus in Step 7).

   It is crucial that for example X (Desktop) is not be running during
   these steps to conserve as much memory as possible, as we we need as
   much as possible desperately during the compilation and installation of
   FPC and Lazarus Pascal IDE.

   To find the IP address, in the command line or Teminal type:


   ifconfig

   You should see something like this:


   1
   2
   3
   4
   5
   6
   7
   8
   9
   10
   11
   12
   13
   14
   15
   16
   pi@raspberrypi ~ $ ifconfig
   eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr b8:27:eb:f6:5e:4d
             inet addr:192.168.2.9  Bcast:192.168.2.255
   Mask:255.255.255.0
             UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
             RX packets:545 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
             TX packets:98 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
             collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000
             RX bytes:34746 (33.9 KiB)  TX bytes:14520 (14.1 KiB)
   lo        Link encap:Local Loopback
             inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
             UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1
             RX packets:8 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
             TX packets:8 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0

             RX bytes:1104 (1.0 KiB)  TX bytes:1104 (1.0 KiB)

   If you look at line 2, you’ll see it starts with “eth0” – this is your
   ethernet adapter.
   In line 3, next to “inet addr:” you will see the IP address of your
   Raspberry Pi – take note of it (in this example: 192.168.2.9).

   Now you can use your favorite SSH application to access your Raspberry
   Pi from your computer – as of this point HDMI Monitor (or TV) and USB
   keyboard will no longer be needed.

   Read this short article on “How to work with SSH connections (SSH
   Clients)” – You can right away jump to the section relevant for the OS
   on your computer with these links:
     * Windows users
     * MacOS X users
     * Linux users


   If you’d rather use your browser, then you could also use this method
   with Google Chrome.

       Reboot you Raspberry Pi

   If you made any of these changes: Reboot your Raspberry Pi:


   sudo reboot

Step 4 – Getting the latest Free Pascal Compiler

   Before we can install Lazarus, we will need Free Pascal Compiler (FPC)
   to be able to compile it.
   But here comes the kicker … to get the latest FPC version we will need
   FPC to compile the latest FPC version. This is called Bootstrapping
   (according to the Wiki page).

   Don’t worry, I’ll walk you through the process, one step at a time.
   Please keep in mind that I’m not an expert either.

Bad Suggestion… that seems to work…

   I’ve installed FPC and Lazarus IDE on several SD-Cards, so I had to go
   through these steps a few times.

   Funny observation is that when I simply copy the suggested commands in
   the SSH window, followed by pressing ENTER, without even thinking, the
   process goes very well. The minute I start thinking about what I’m
   doing, I seem to be bound to fail haha …

   Now I can already hear the more experienced users grinch… and they are
   very right in doing so.

   This however works for me time and time again (with these particular
   steps).

       Install SubVersion (SVN)

   First we will get “subversion” (a.k.a SVN) so we can download the
   latest version from the Free Pascal SVN.
   From the shell, via your SSH connection, execute the following (when
   asked for confirmation, simply press ENTER):


   1
   2
   3
   sudo su
   apt-get update
   apt-get install -y subversion

   This will open a Super User shell (su), tell “apt-get” (a package
   manager) to update, and finally download and install subversion.

       Install FPC 2.6.4

   To be able to compile the latest FPC version, we will first need to get
   an older FPC version, which is relatively easy by getting a
   pre-compiled ARM version.


   1
   2
   3
   4
   5
   mkdir /usr/local/fpc
   cd /usr/local/fpc
   wget
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/freepascal/files/Linux/2.6.4/fpc-2.6.4.
   arm-linux.tar
   tar xvf fpc-2.6.4.arm-linux.tar
   cd fpc-2.6.4.arm-linux

Caution: Use the right Install Prefix

   In the next step, we will install FPC, but you have to be aware that
   the [first] question

   Install prefix (/usr or /usr/local) [/usr] :

   MUST be answered with /usr/local, otherwise everything will go to hell
   and fail.

   Now execute the install script as follows, and remember to answer the
   first question correctly – all other questions can be answered by
   pressing ENTER and therefor taking the default option.


   1
   ./install.sh

   Once done, you can type fpc  on the command line for verification,
   which should give you the help info for FPC, starting with a statement
   of the FPC version (2.6.4).

       Downloading the latest FPC version sources

   The next step is to get the latest FPC sources from SVN. This will take
   a little bit, so start looking for that cup of coffee …


   1
   2
   3
   cd /usr/local/fpc
   svn co http://svn.freepascal.org/svn/fpc/trunk source
   cd source

       Compile the latest FPC version

   This step is going to take a while (hence the suggested overclocking):
   Compiling and installing FPC.


   1
   2
   3
   make all OPT=-dFPC_ARMHF
   make install OPT=-dFPC_ARMHF PREFIX=/usr/local
   make install sourceinstall OPT=-dFPC_ARMHF PREFIX=/usr/local

   Each of these steps will take a while, and a LOT of messages, including
   warnings, will fly by over your screen.
   Just be patient until each step completes before starting the next
   step.

   If you’d try fpc now, you’ll notice you’re still running FPC 2.6.4, and
   that’s not what we want. To achieve using the new version, we will need
   to create a symbolic link to ppcarm (which stands for Portable Pascal
   Compiler ARM – see this Linux man page) so it points to the right
   binary.

   To do this, we will first need to find out what version we just
   installed – at the time of this writing, it’s 3.1.1. By the time you’re
   reading this, it might be a different number.

   So let’s see what we’ve got …


   ls /usr/local/lib/fpc

   This should list something like this:


   1
   2.6.4   3.1.1   lexyacc

   In this example we see that we have version 2.6.4 and 3.1.1 (the latter
   might be different for your situation).
   Now remember that number, 3.1.1, as we need it in the following step.

   In the second statement, change the number 3.1.1 for what you’ve seen
   in your setup:


   1
   2
   rm -f /usr/local/bin/ppcarm
   ln -sf /usr/local/lib/fpc/3.1.1/ppcarm /usr/local/bin/ppcarm

   We double check the symbolic link with:


   ls -l /usr/local/bin/ppcarm

   It should show something like this:


   lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 31 Apr 20 13:48 /usr/local/bin/ppcarm ->
   /usr/local/lib/fpc/3.1.1/ppcarm

   You see how it points to our new compiler
   (/usr/local/lib/fpc/3.1.1/ppcarm)?
   If it DOESN’T, then you made a booboo with the second statement – go
   back to “Let’s see what we’ve got …” and try again.

   If you’d try fpc  now, you’ll notice you’re still running the new FPC
   version (in my example: 3.1.1).

Step 5 – Install the Lazarus Pascal IDE

       Getting some additional Packages

   Before we can build Lazarus Pascal IDE, we will need to install the
   following packages … when running the “apt-get”, just use ENTER to
   confirm the question if you’d like to install all this.


   1
   2
   apt-get update
   apt-get install -y libx11-dev libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev libcairo2-dev
   gir1.2-coglpango-1.0 libpangox-1.0-dev xorg-dev libgtk2.0-dev
   libpango1.0-dev

       Download the latest Lazarus sources

   This will look very similar to what we have done with FPC … so here we
   go:


   1
   2
   3
   mkdir /usr/local/lazarus
   cd /usr/local/lazarus
   svn co http://svn.freepascal.org/svn/lazarus/trunk source

       Compile the latest Lazarus Pascal IDE version

   This again will be a lengthy process, so this is also a good time to
   read the Lazarus Wiki page on using “Lazarus with the Raspberry Pi“,
   specially the GPIO section looks interesting. Did you get a coke or a
   coffee …?

   Here we go:


   1
   2
   3
   cd source
   make all OPT=-dFPC_ARMHF
   make install OPT=-dFPC_ARMHF PREFIX=/usr/local

   If this didn’t crash somewhere, then you have finally installed the
   latest Lazarus IDE with the latest Free Pascal Compiler.

   After compilation has completed, you should see a “lazarus” copy in the
   “/usr/local/share” directory.
   The sources we just used can now be removed (about 1Gb worth of
   duplicate data):


   1
   rm -rf /usr/local/lazarus

Step 6 – Going to the Desktop

   We will need access to the desktop of your Raspberry Pi, and with that
   I mean access to the windows environment (X).

   You can choose one, or both of the options below.

       Option 1 – Remote access with a VNCServer (optional)

   For those of us (me included) who prefer to use their regular computer
   to work on their Raspberry Pi, consider installing a VNCServer. In this
   example (taken from the Raspberry Pi documentation) we will use
   TightVNC server.

   First download and install TightVNC Server:


   1
   2
   apt-get update
   apt-get install -y tightvncserver

   The installation of ThightVNC Server will ask confirmation for
   installation, press ENTER to confirm.

   I would want TightVNC Server to start whenever the Raspberry Pi boots,
   so we need to create a file in init.d for that (the “autoexec” of
   Linux  ), which we will do with the Nano text editor:


   nano /etc/init.d/vncboot

   Now that Nano is open, paste the following in it:

      #Insert your favoured settings for a VNC session
      /usr/bin/vncserver :0 -geometry 1280x800 -depth 16 -pixelformat
   rgb565
      ;;
    stop)
      echo "Stopping VNC Server"
      /usr/bin/vncserver -kill :0
      ;;
    *)
      echo "Usage: /etc/init.d/vncboot {start|stop}"
      exit 1
      ;;
   esac
   exit 0

   After that press CTRL+X, press “y” to confirm that you want to save it,
   and press ENTER to confirm the filename.

   You can change the desired resolution if you’d like of course.
   On my computer I prefer the 1440×900 resolution over the 1280×800,
   which would make line #21:


   21
   /usr/bin/vncserver :0 -geometry 1440x900 -depth 16 -pixelformat rgb565

   Now that we have this file, we need to change the permission so that on
   boot it can be executed, and we will have to tell the OS about it:


   1
   2
   3
   cd /etc/init.d
   chmod 755 vncboot
   update-rc.d vncboot defaults

   (the Raspberry Pi documentation suggest using  update-rc.d
   /etc/init.d/vncboot defaults , but that didn’t work for me)

   As of this point you should start TightVNC Server with:


   /etc/init.d/vncboot start

   When starting TightVNC Server the first time, it will ask you to
   provide a password needed to be able to access your desktop. I would
   recommend using one …

   A Read-Only password can be provided as well. I have no purpose for e
   read-only view, so I chose to answer this with “n”.

   You can reboot your Raspberry Pi now, and see that TightVNC Server
   actually starts at boot time. But you can also wait until later. (in a
   Super User shell, you can simply type “reboot” to reboot)

   Oh and before I forget, you can stop TightVNC Server with:


   /etc/init.d/vncboot stop

       Option 2 – Boot Raspberry Pi directly into the Desktop (optional)

   Accessing your Raspberry Pi remotely is nice … but using it as a
   standalone computer would be nice too.

   For this we can use the RaspBian configuration that we have used at the
   beging of this project (see also Raspberry Pi Documentation for more
   details):


   sudo raspi-config

   Under option “3 Enable Boot to Desktop/Scratch” you can choose to boot
   in the console (shell/terminal), the graphical user interface desktop,
   or scratch (a simple tool for learning to program for kids).

   Choose “Desktop Log in as user ‘pi’ at the graphical desktop” and
   select “Finish” to save the changes.

   Your Raspberry Pi will now always boot in to the Desktop.

Step 7 – Running Lazarus the First Time

   You can either start remote access right now, or reboot your Raspberry
   Pi into the Desktop – which ever you prefer.

       VNC Access

   When using remote access (with TightVNC), you’ll first need to get a
   VNC Client – which is available for pretty much any platform you can
   come up with. Even versions for Android and iOS exist – even though you
   can argue how practical that we be.

   RealVNC has versions for Windows, Linux and MacOS X, which can be
   downloaded for free.

   VNC Viewer alternatives :
     * MacOS X users can use “Screen Sharing“, which comes with MacOS X,
     * Windows users can use “TightVNC Viewer“,
     * Ubuntu users can use “Remote Desktop Viewer” that comes with Ubuntu


       Starting Lazarus

   Starting Lazarus is easy … simply click the menu button in the upper
   left corner of your RaspBian desktop. Under “Programming” you’ll find
   “Lazarus” – amazing right?

   Start Lazarus

   Start Lazarus

       Telling Lazarus where the FPC sources can be found

   However,… during the first start of Lazarus, you’ll see that Lazarus
   cannot find it’s FPC sources …

   This is only a one-time event … once set you do not have to repeat this
   step.

   RaspBian - Lazarus can't find the FPC sources

   RaspBian – Lazarus can’t find the FPC sources

   Simply enter /usr/local/fpc/source  and click “Start IDE” and you’re
   good to go …

   To do a quick test of Lazarus, I always throw a button on the form, add
   some on-click code and run it (i.e. press the green arrow icon in the
   upper left corner) to make sure everything works OK.

   Note that compiling an application on the Raspberry Pi is slower than
   on a regular PC – so be patient.

   I’ve tested if the debugger worked correctly with break-points, and I
   can confirm that this works very well as well.

 Tip: Reclaim some more disk space

   RaspBian comes pretty clean, but some stuff is included that I have no
   use for, which can be removed saving quite a bit of disk space. With
   the commands below, I still assume you’re having your SSH open with a
   Super User (su) shell.

   If not, then type “sudo su” first right after you opened a shell.

   The statements below will remove some unneeded old fpc files, log
   files and games, and some packages like some more games, Wolfram,
   Scratch, Dillo, GPicView, etc.
   After that “apt-get” will do a clean up.

    If you still want to use SubVersion, for example for newer FPC or
   Lazarus Pascal source, then please remove “subversion” from line 5 as
   well.

            Hi John!
            Thanks for the positive feedback – it’s much appreciated.
            OTAPI’s manual is actually pretty good, but I kept getting
            error messages when trying to compile the Lazarus IDE.
            A few minor changes and optimizing some of his steps, made it
            work. Still not sure why  .
            I also added my own “prep” steps …
            Thanks again!

       Really good guide! Thanks!
       I have trouble adding components to the palette though. Using the
       “Install/Uninstall Packages” doesn’t work. I keep getting an error
       saying “One or more packages were not found. See package graph for
       details”. It also says the packages will be installed on next
       start. This doesn’t happen though… I have checked and confirmed
       that the packages are available and located exactly where they
       should be.
       Any idéa on how to solve this? There are a few components that I
       need. For example the TAChart components and the SQlite components.
       Best regards,

            I should not take all the credit for it … but I’m glad this
            work for you.
            I will try to install TAChart and SQLite components, hopefully
            this afternoon.
            I did test anchordocking earlier, just to see if packages
            would be installed, and that worked just fine.
            Are these the packages you’re getting the error with?

            I apologize for the delay, mom’s birthday got in the way …
            I’ve installed “sqlite3laz 0.4” without a problem. To use
            SQLite 3, you’ll probably also need:
apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
            p.s. If you installed “sqlitelaz 0.4” as well then you might
            get a duplicate file error.
            Next I’ve tried “tachartlazaruspkg 1.0” and that one installed
            just fine as well. And even placing it on a form work fine.
            Could you please let me know which component cause the error
            message, and maybe post the error message as well? This would
            be helpful in determining what’s going on …
            (would also be helpful for this article if this is indeed an
            issue)

                 I’ll give it another try. I might have included another
                 component that causes the error. I’ll let you know wich
                 component cthat is if I can figure it out.

                      This may be caused by using Lazarus 1.5 which is not
                      a release version… Installing 1.4 seems like a
                      better idea…

                      Haha, great … you’re running into the same error
                      I’ve run into.
                      This meant in my case that I had to increase the
                      swap size even more.
                      At least that worked for me when I started compiling
                      the BRGA components.
                      (I’ve added a warning in the swap size section
                      yesterday addressing exactly that)
sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile
                      Set
CONF_SWAPSIZE=1000
                      and reboot.
                      Lazarus 1.5 runs fine with my setup – but if you’d
                      like you could try to checkout 1.4.
                      I have not tested this, but I think the SVN for 1.4
                      would be:

                           Awesome!
                           Was it the swapfile size?
                           If so then I probably should recommend a bigger
                           size in general in this article …

                           It was the swap size that solved it. I set it
                           to 1000 and it all works fine now.
                           I do get a warning when compiling applications
                           though.
                           “crtbegin.o not found, this will probably cause
                           a linking failure”

                           linking failure”
                           The compile still works fine and the resulting
                           application runs fine.

            Hi Aidv,
            Ehm… can you tell me what the error message is?
            Without it, I can’t really help troubleshooting.
            First and foremost; start with a clean Raspbian.
            Next follow each step to the tee – I’ve done these steps
            several times and found that bluntly copying the steps works
            best. The only point where I make an exception is with the
            Lazarus IDE compiling step.
cd source
make all OPT=-dFPC_ARMHF
make install OPT=-dFPC_ARMHF PREFIX=/usr/local
            I always execute that one step-by-step – so I can see the
            errors from the “make all” line, in case any occur.
            Other tips:
            – This guide was written for a “Raspberry Pi 2 Model B“, so do
            not try this with a regular Model A or Model B Raspberry Pi.
            – Increase the swap file size to 1000 (versus 500) when you
            see this error:
lazarus.pp(142,42) Error: Can’t call the assembler, error -1 switching to extern

                 Sounds like the 2nd step (below) of the 3 steps to
                 compile and install the Lazarus IDE failed.
make all OPT=-dFPC_ARMHF
                 Can you work your way up to that point and see what the
                 output is?
                 (I apologize – I know it takes a LOT of time to get to
                 that point)

This time it works. I'm up and running. I think that SwapSize = 1000 does the tr

       I noted that when using the vnc server we actually run as user
       root. That is not always a good idea. I’d like to run it as user
       pi. How can that be done?

            I just followed the recommendations of the Raspberry Pi
            Documentation and since security isn’t a big deal on my
            Raspberry Pi that I use for development I didn’t even bother
            looking at it.
            I have not tested this, but you might be able to create a
            “vncuser” and modify
nano /etc/init.d/vncboot
            and modify lines 12 and 13 (replace root):
USER=root
HOME=/root
            Like I said: untested, because I do not have access to my
            stuff at the moment (traveling).

            Did you maybe skip the building of FPC and making a symbolic
            link?
            Is this in the compile steps of FPC or Lazarus?
            What do you see when you type just “fpc” and press enter on
            the command line?
            Does it say version 2.6.4? Or 3.3.1?
            If it says 2.6.4 then the symbolic link did not work, or you
            might have skipped it.
            See Step 4 – Install the latest FPC version.

       Thank you so much !
       Coming from windows world, dealing with this linux thing on RPi2
       was just a nightmare for me.
       your guide was just what i needed to start programming pascal
       without any knowledge of linux.
       Thanks again, you saved me so much time with this !

            Hi Testeurfou!
            You’re welcome, and I’m glad to hear that you’re working with
            Pascal on your RPI now …
            p.s. especially when you’re not using the GPIO of your RPI;
            consider developing the program first on a regular desktop or
            laptop – it will go a lot faster when testing your
            application. I’ve done the same thing for an application I’m
            building.
            Once I’ve build the major GUI and functions, I transfer the
            sources to the RPI to then add GPIO functions and tweak things
            in the GUI.

       Thanks for the guide.  Very precise and actually worked.  I had to
       wade through a lot of disinformation before finding this.
       You’re da man !
       One little thing I had trouble with:
       >If you’d try fpc now, you’ll notice you’re still running FPC
       2.6.4, and that’s not what we want. To achieve using the new
       version, we will need to create a symbolic link to ppcarm (which
       >stands for Portable Pascal Compiler ARM – see this Linux man page)
       so it points to the right binary.
       Even after doing the above I couldn’t get Lazarus to compile until
       I ran ./samplecfg from the fpc folder.

            Good find on the “samplecfg”! I was totally unaware of that
            one.
            Next time I build Lazarus, I’ll try to do that as well so I
            can properly document it above.

       Found your instructions today and plan to try them shortly.
       Regarding not being able to install fpc/lazarus using apt-get on
       the model B, I had the same problem and found the workaround which
       involves fixing the sources.list file. My notes for the fix are
       here:

            Hi Dan!
            Thanks for the info! I took the liberty of copying the info
            here as well, please let me know if that’s OK with you. If
            not, then I’ll just remove it again …
               o From Dan’s Blog:
            Apt-get install fpc lazarus fails with “fpc : Depends:
            fpc-2.6.0 (= 2.6.0-9+rpi1) but it is not going to be
            installed” on Raspberry Pi
            Evidently, something has been changed recently in Raspbian
            making it impossible to install FPC or Lazarus. From what I
            can tell, it seems to be the inclusion of a package called
            binutils-gold. After spending time researching the problem, I
            found the answer here.
            The solution is pretty simple.
            Using a text editor of your choice edit the sources.list file:
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
            Now add the line:
deb http://plugwash.raspbian.org/wsf wheezy-wsf main
            Save source.list, apt-get update and you should be good to go:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install fpc
sudo apt-get install lazarus

                 which is excellent. Now I’m trying again, except with the
                 stable releases of fpc/lazarus. And of course straying is
                 not working smoothly.

       First of all, your guide is excellent. This is the best guide I’ve
       been able to find and your hard work is evident in the detail you
       supply.
       I have encountered a problem with the installation of FPC on
       a Raspberry Pi Model B+ with 512MB.
       If I follow the simple instructions at the start of the article FPC
       and Lazarus both install properly:
       sudo apt-get update
       sudo apt-get upgrade
       sudo apt-get install fpc
       sudo apt-get install lazarus

       But when I follow the instructions (using cut & paste as
       suggested) to build the latest version when I get to these
       commands:
       make all OPT=-dFPC_ARMHF
       make install OPT=-dFPC_ARMHF PREFIX=/usr/local
       make install sourceinstall OPT=-dFPC_ARMHF PREFIX=/usr/local
       I get multiple instances of the following exception error:
       make -C linux all
       make[7]: Entering directory ‘/usr/local/fpc/source/rtl/linux’
       An unhandled exception occurred at $0005FFC4:
       EAccessViolation: Access violation
         $0005FFC4
         $0003CE94
         $00036E94
       and the make process fails.
       I have tried setting the swap file to 1000 with the same results.
       Any ideas on what else to try would be appreciated.

            Hi Rusty,
            thank you very much for the compliment – it’s always very much
            appreciated.
            As for the error you’re running into: my guess is that has to
            do with the target CPU?
            This article was written with the Raspberry Pi 2 in mind
            (blows my mind why they call it a “Raspberry Pi 2 Model B” as
            it’s very confusing and suggests the “Raspberry Pi Model B”,
            which has a different CPU).
            Maybe the info in this post is helpful?
            Or follow the tip bij BigDan?

            I was able to duplicate this problem on my Model 1 B +. After
            digging around some, I found if I change the OPT parameter on
            all of the make commands to OPT=”-dFPC_ARMHF -CpARMV6 -OpARMV6
            ” then it will compile fine. As I understand it, this compiles
            FPC/Lazarus for version 6 of the ARM CPU which is what the
            Model 1 is.
            I compiled it (it took MANY hours to do this on a Model 1 B)
            and created a single test application which ran OK.

                 1: I forgot to give my reference for figuring the above
                 out. It is here:

                 -1-on-raspberry-pi/
                 2: I have found that a program compiled on a Model 2
                 using the procedure laid out here will NOT run on a model
                 1. However, code on a Model 1 WILL run on a model 2.
                 Tomorrow I will try compiling the ARMV6 version of code
                 on the ARMV7 CPU to see if that allows backward
                 compatibility. I have quite a few Model 1 RPIs and I
                 would like to be able to distribute software in both
                 directions.

                      I was able to verify that compiling FPC/Lazarus for
                      ARMV6 on a model will allow the FPC compiler to
                      produce code that will run on both model 1 and model
                      2.

                           I would think so. I believe the Raspian Lazarus
                           package was compiled for Model 1 and runs on
                           both.
                           If I knew how to build packages, I would
                           package the new compiler to allow for easy
                           installation.

                           Or I should have used Google …
                           I found this link in the Lazarus Wiki – How to
                           build a Debian Package.
                           I’d test it myself, but unfortunately I have no
                           Raspberry Pi laying around (still somewhere
                           between the US and Europe).
                           It “looks” pretty simply, but when reading it,
                           I’m not sure if it does only FPC or FPC and
                           Lazarus in one package, and you’d need to
                           compile FPC (and Lazarus?) before one would be
                           able to do this.
                           From the Lazarus Wiki:
                           Important: This script does not create the
                           official debian/ubuntu packages. It creates a
                           fpc package that contains the compiler and all
                           packages.
                           To build the package you need to install some
                           packages:
sudo apt-get install libgpmg1-dev fakeroot libncurses5-dev build-essential
                           Go into your lazarus source directory. The
                           directory must be writable.
cd ~/freepascal/lazarus/tools/install
./create_fpc_deb.sh fpc ~/freepascal/fpc
                           If you get an error about a missing file or
                           tool you may have to install a missing package.
                           If you get a compilation error your installed
                           fpc is not the released compiler or you were
                           unlucky and fetched a fpc svn reversion that
                           contains a bug. Search help on the mailing
                           list, forum or chat. If it ran through you now
                           have a deb file, which you can install:
sudo dpkg -i fpc_2.5.1-091121_i386.deb
                           The file name is different for you.
                           Note : When I tried this in a VM Linux distro,
                           I couldn’t even find the initial path. So info
                           might be missing. Or my Linux distro did not
                           have the complete stuff.

                           I’ve added this to my todolist to try when I

                 Thanks BigDan for posting the solution for Model 1 Pi’s!
                 As far as I understand the model 1 has an ARM v6 and the
                 model 2 has an ARM v7 CPU.
                 Now we can only wait for FPC to automatically use
                 multiple cores so we see some serious speed increase.
                 When developing apps for the Raspberry Pi, except for the
                 PIO pins, I always do the majority of the work on a
                 regular computer (Mac, Windows, Linux) since compiling
                 takes a while each time you’d want to test some code.
                 After that I move the sources over the RPI and finish the
                 RPI specific parts.

                      Hans, BigDan,
                      Thank you for your help. Your advice and links saved
                      me an incredible amount of time.
                      I got a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B, built the FRC on it
                      and then modified it to build for the Raspberry Pi
                      Model B+.
                      I can now write Pascal code that will run on either
                      platform which is nice since I’m generating code for
                      an array of Raspberry Pi processors that might
                      contain any of the different Raspberry Pi models.

       I think you’re correct.
       The B+ has a single core processor (ARM 6) while the Raspberry Pi 2
       Model B has a quad core processor (ARM A7/A15).
       The exception error probably comes when the compiler tries to use
       some feature not present in the A6.
       I’ll look at the make files to see if they can be modified to avoid
       this problem.
       In the mean time I’ll try to use FPC 2.6.4 or just get a RasPi 2
       Model B.
       Thanks for your help, keep up the great work.

       I tracked down how to correct the linking error indicating
       ‘crtbegin.o’ and ‘crtend.o’ are not found.
       The compiler needs to know where to find the gcc library.
       To determine the directory I use:
       sudo find / -name crtbegin.o
       It found the file in /usr/lib/gcc/arm-linux-gnueabihf/4.6
       Now you need to add that library to /etc/fpc.cfg. Type (or use the
       editor of your choice)
       sudo vi /etc/fpc.cfg
       Search for the comment “# path to the gcclib”. You will find there
       is no library listed under this comment. Add the library directory
       above like this:
       # path to the gcclib
       -Fl/usr/lib/gcc/arm-linux-gnueabihf/4.6

       Just a head’s up:
       After building a current compiler for my Raspberry Pi, I decided to
       build a current cross as well. My old one dates back to Lazarus
       9.8. I documented concise instructions to build the cross compiler
       here

            Hi BigDan!
            Thanks for the write-up and for posting the link!
            If I understand the article right; this is to develop and
            compile Raspberry Pi Apps under Linux.
            Would it be capable of developing using GPIO? Or not (which I
            assume)?
            Right now I develop on a Mac, minus GTK2 and GPIO specific
            code. Then move the code to the Raspberry Pi and add the
            missing GPIO/GTK2 stuff – would not mind doing this in an
            easier way.

                 My normal flow is to maintain the code on an linux i386
                 box. When I compile, I have a command in the compile
                 script that transmits the object code to the RPI and I
                 test it there. I will be updating my post, shortly, to
                 describe those settings.
                 Also, sadly, I have found the same stupid bug still
                 exists in the cross compiler that messes up GUI fonts
                 which really makes cross compiling worthless for GUI apps
                 (which I don’t normally write but I am trying to write
                 one now). I’ll document that further in my post as well.

                 Yeah, the “font” issue seems a common theme with all
                 cross platform development [with Lazarus].
                 I’ve had my share of issues with that as well. Wait until
                 you start using a HighDPI screen (ie. Apple Retina screen

       Hi,
       I have an ethernet enabled device that has a driver written in

       Pi 2 Model B 1GB (box label).  I’ve been stuffing around trying to
       get Pascal running and eventually ended up at this site.  I’m
       having trouble getting Lazarus to compile, the error I’m getting is
       :-

       I hope someone can help.
       This is probably the 2nd or 3rd attempt at Lazarus so I hope I
       don’t need to restart at the very beginning with fpc.  I in fact
       installed (using apt-get) the earlier version of Lazarus after
       compiling the latest fpc (3.1.1).  Lazarus runs but the code for
       the driver uses about 5 other libraries, I since forgotten some are
       ‘lazutils’, another about printers Laz4printers ???
       Looks like most of us with the Pascal need – end up at this page –
       invaluable.

            Hi Mike!
            I wouldn’t call this page invaluable, but I do very much
            appreciate the thought  .
            I know “LazUtils” is a standard component for Lazarus. This
            makes me wonder if your path (to the component sources) set
            correctly in Lazarus IDE. Now, I do not have access to my RPI
            right now, so I cannot verify the exact path you’d need. But
            this is where I would start looking.
            I hope others can chime in as well … oh and of course you’re
            familiar with the official Lazarus Forum, there are some quite
            helpful people there as well.
            Sorry I could not be of more help …

            Had another attempt, starting from building fpc, this time I
            set to superuser using ‘su sudo’  earlier I had executed the
            commands using ‘sudo’.  I made through to the lazarus install
            where I ran out of space.  So I did a ‘make clean’ from
            lazarus and rip the install again, this time it worked.  I
            even get Lazarus up without the warnings of missing packages.
             Still having issues on build/compile.  Like:
            Compile package FCL 1.0.1: Exit code 256, Errors. 1
            * registerfcl.pas(45,28)Fatal: Cannot find process used by
            RegisterFCL of package FCL.
            Maybe this is simply a pascal coding thing and nothing else.

                 Actually, a closer reveals that I may well have the
                 latest versions of fpc and Lazarus, I’m still getting the
                 original problem, missing packages showing as required in
                 the Project Inspector :- LazUtils, FCL, Printer4Lazarus,
                 TAChartLazarusPkg, SynEdit, LCL.  So do I need to get
                 these from somewhere, or is it likely I already have just
                 can’t see them?

                      You most likely have them and for example LCL is
                      required … even if it’s just to start/compile the
                      IDE.

                 Hi Mike,
                 I didn’t know SU and SUDO would result in different user
                 access – I always was under the impression that both
                 triggered root access. SU being a shell and SUDO for a
                 single command.
                 Either way, Lazarus cannot find the sources of it’s
                 packages,… I’d really start looking in the settings in
                 the IDE.
                 Most certainly LazUtils, SynEdit and LCL are standard
                 Lazarus components.
                 Check “Tools” – “Options” – “Files”, I suspect that
                 “Lazarus Directory” is not correct, … “LCL” should be in
                 that directory, and so should the directory “components”.
                 Check the Lazarus directory also to make sure those
                 directories exist.
                 The components other packages, TAChartLazrusPkg (dir:
                 components/tachart), SynEdit (dir: components/synedit)
                 and Printer4Lazarus (dir: components/printers), should be
                 there too. FCL I am not familiar with (could this be:
                 components/pascalscript ?). But this is what I found in
                 my Lazarus directory.
                 Did you maybe relocate Lazarus after compiling it?

       You are the man!.  This was clear and to the point.  Worked
       perfectly.  One note to add to it is another reason you can get a
can’t call the assembler, error -1
       is because you have dorked around with the GPU memory in the
       initial configuration.  I set it to 256 (default 64) and that
       caused this error as well.

            Thanks for the tip – I had never played with the GPU memory in
            the config.txt file, but it’s good to know that this has an
            effect as well.
            For those interested, read more here.
            Did you notice any advantages in increasing the GPU memory
            (performance wise)?

       Thank you from someone who has recently finished full time work and
       is getting back into electronics and programming after many many
       years of doing none of it! (Although I started 3D printing a couple
       of years ago!).
       Tutorials like this are invaluable to people like me who have a
       base knowledge which has not kept up to date as the technology has
       expanded over the years. I didn’t understand most of the steps but
       thanks to your very well written instructions, I now have a Visual
       Pascal system which works on my new RPi, (I managed to compile and
       run a two button, one label, one edit box program without any
       problem) AND some bits of Linux command knowledge which I didn’t
       have before.
       What I need to do now is find out how to install BigDan’s “wrapper”
       code for WiringPi so that I can get to grips with the GPIO pins. I
       used to teach Delphi back in 1995 before I left programming behind
       but there a are a lot of new terms around now that I have never
       come across which makes things a wee bit ‘challenging’ :-)
       Top work – thank you again,

       I found this How-to when trying to set up a Lazarus/fpc environment
       on a RPi2B.
       The purpose is to create a control program for RPi2 based on a
       number of source files from Delphi7/2007 in Windows.
       So it was natural to try the Lazarus/FPC route….
       I have followed the steps successfully until this command:
make all OPT=-dFPC_ARMHF
       It chugs along for quite a while and then outputs this error after
       doing 53% of the job:
[ 53%] Compiled package utils-fprcp
Start compiling package utils-h2pas for target arm-linux.
Executing command "/usr/local/bin/plex h2pas/scan.l h2pas/scan.pas"
The installer encountered the following error:
External command "/usr/local/bin/plex h2pas/scan.l h2pas/scan.pas" failed with e
xit code 256. Console output:

       It seems to me to be a deficiency in the sources downloaded by svn,
       but I am not sure.
       Notice I am using Raspbian-Jessie because that was the latest
       version of Raspbian.
       And I have set swap to 1000.
       What could be the reason for this error???

            UPDATE:
            I pulled the SDcard from the RPi2 and created a new system
            using the Raspbian-Wheezy image from 2015-05-05 instead.
            With this image the error does not appear on make of FPC.
            I have now executed all of the steps without error to the end.
            :)
            Lazarus is running on my Pi2B and I can interact via TightVNC,
            just exactly like I wanted to!
            THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS INVALUABLE TUTORIAL!!!!!!!!

                 I was too quick!
                 I found out that when following your instruction for
                 setting up VNC the resulting VNC GUI shell runs as root,
                 which is not what we want…
                 What you need to do is the following:
                 1) Installation of tightvncserver
                 do this as user pi in pi:s home dir:
sudo apt-get install tightvncserver
tightvncserver  (in order to run for the first time and set up the environment i
ncluding logon password)
                 2) Create the /etc/init.d/vncboot script
                 Proceed as in your description but use this script
                 instead (changes are USER and HOME values and a su
                 command in the vncserver line):
#!/bin/sh
### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides: vncboot
# Required-Start: $remote_fs $syslog
# Required-Stop: $remote_fs $syslog
# Default-Start: 2 3 4 5
# Default-Stop: 0 1 6
# Short-Description: Start VNC Server at boot time
# Description: Start VNC Server at boot time.
### END INIT INFO

USER=pi
HOME=/home/pi
export USER HOME
case "$1" in
 start)
   echo "Starting VNC Server"
   #Insert your favoured settings for a VNC session
   su - pi -c "/usr/bin/vncserver :0 -geometry 1280x800 -depth 16 -pixelformat r
gb565"
   ;;
 stop)
   echo "Stopping VNC Server"
   /usr/bin/vncserver -kill :0
   ;;
 *)
   echo "Usage: /etc/init.d/vncboot {start|stop}"
   exit 1
   ;;
esac
exit 0
                 Set the script permissions etc as described.
                 3) If you need to change the installation after it is
                 already active as root (like I had to) then:
                 You must first stop the running server and then move any
                 existing .vnc dir in the pi home dir.
cd /home/pi
sudo su
/etc/init.d/vncboot stop
mv .vnc .vnc.old

                 Next switch back to user pi and run the server once
                 manually and enter the password when requested:
tightvncserver
                 Then you could edit the vncboot script as above and
                 activate its changes and restart the server with:
update-rc.d vncboot defaults
/etc/init.d/vncboot start

                 I think this should solve the problem.
                 In any case I advice to modify the description such that
                 the logon user for the VNC window becomes pi rather than
                 root.

                      Thanks BosseB for the good explanation.
                      I have to admit that I just followed the Raspberry
                      Pi documentation on the VNC part.
                      For a developer it might not be too bad (on a
                      Raspberry Pi) to just have root access, but in
                      certain scenario’s I can imagine that it might be
                      better to use te user “pi”.
                      Thanks for the excellent tip!

       Hi again,
       I have now repeated the steps in this tutorial (with my slight
       modifications regarding VNC) 4 times and it works just fine on
       Raspbian-wheezy.
       But on Jessie I did not succeed…
       Did you try to complete the installation also on Jessie so you can
       confirm that it is possible?
       I will try once more using a blank 8GB SDcard today and note what
       goes wrong.
       I know already that the VNC installation will require modification
       because the Jessie default is to boot into the GUI and this
       reserves display :0.

            I have now tested to do the installation on Jessie.
            Started with an 8GB card but then I got an error while
            compiling the lazarus IDE, which indicated that I needed more
            swap.
            But when I tried to increase swap from 1000 to 1500 Raspbian
            became sluggish even at logon so I checked disk usage and it
            was too small.
            So I transferred the image to a 16 GB card instead and then I
            could actually compile to the end without errors even with
            swap set to 1000.
            I started the installation with the default setting for boot
            (boot to GUI with pi logged on) and this forced me to install
            tightvncserver to operate on display :1 rather than :0.
            When I received the compile error I changed the boot option to
            only boot to the command line interface.
            So when I finally succeeded in compiling both FPC and Lazarus
            the Pi was set to boot to the command line. I did all work via
            the PuTTY SSH shell.
            The problem now remaining for Lazarus is that unlike what
            happened in Wheezy when I compiled and installed Lazarus there
            is no Menu item Programming/Lazarus to actually start lazarus
            from! It seems like this time it was not created even though
            that happened when I installed on Wheezy.
            Do you have any idea what caused this or what I could do in
            order to start Lazarus?

            Hi BosseB,
            I have yet to try to do this on Jessie.
            Did you do a clean install or follow the upgrade path as
            suggest here?
            There are two factors that play a role: the system and the
            FPC/Lazarus version.
            Now we know the system is a newer version, which version are
            you using for FPC and Lazarus IDE?
            Since you’re missing the “shortcut” to Lazarus, you can run
            “startlazarus” or “lazarus” from the commandline. You should
            be able to find it in the Lazarus install directory, since I
            do not have a RPI at hand right now, you should be able to
            start it with something like:
/usr/local/lazarus/startlazarus

                 I did a clean install from a downloaded Jessie image so
                 there should be no problems due to faulty migration or
                 such.
                 I followed the installation steps here (again) and now
                 the svn downloads got me revisions fpc=3200,
                 lazarus=50023
                 So those are the bleeding edge versions from svn trunk as
                 of yesterday.
                 I should also add that in order to complete the lazarus
                 compile without errors I had to set swap to 1000 as
                 suggested here but also configure the Pi to boot into the
                 CLI so it does not use up so much RAM for its GUI. After
                 compile I changed back to boot into the GUI.
                 It IS possible to start Lazarus from the Menu in a
                 roundabout way:
                 Menu/Run…
                 Then type in laza and some wizard suggests lazarus-ide,
                 which I select and Lazarus starts up.
                 But it is really an awkward way of starting a GUI
                 program.
                 Once started it works all right in my tests so far. I
                 have checked that I can manipulate GPIO pins using the
                 pigpio.pas driver obtained from the lazarus wiki,
                 although I had to modify it for the RPi2 hardware
                 differences (address of the GPIO for example). I also
                 added defines for the Pi connector pins so they could be
                 matched up correctly. The defines used in the pigpio
                 example are wrong in 4 cases…

                 I’ve tried to locate my Lazarus SD card for my RPI, in
                 the hope that I could locate Lazarus there, but (due to a
                 recent move from the US to the EU), I somehow have
                 misplaced it.
                 You could try straight from Terminal:
startlazarus
                 Or try to locate it in (maybe) one of these directories:
/usr/share/lazarus
/usr/share/lazarus/install/Lazarus
                 Not sure why there is no shortcut, but I guess that’s
                 part of the nature of Linux being slightly different for
                 each distro.

                      Very strange, must be a mistake in Jessie…
                      I installed cvs and cervisia in order to use the
                      company version control system.
                      As a side effect of this installation Lazarus at
                      last appeared in the Menu/Programming sub-menu!!!!
                      But Cervisia is now the program missing from the
                      Menu. Have to start it from Menu/Run.
                      Extremely strange, it seems like the last installed
                      GUI program is always missing from the start Menu
                      (not a great statistical sample though…). But it
                      will appear if another GUI program is installed.
                      How could that happen? Or did the install of
                      Cervisia co-inside with me having started Lazarus
                      enough times from the Menu/Run.. function?
                      Maybe I should post a report in the Raspbian
                      subforum at RPi?

                      That’s weird indeed.
                      With Wheezy it always seems to install in the menu.
                      I’m just not sure if it is the Lazarus install
                      script that adds it, or if the Window/Menu manager
                      of Wheezy is doing this.
                      Maybe it was just a delayed “update” of the menu?
                      If you ask in the RPI forum, which is a good idea,
                      and you find out what the deal is, would you mind
                      posting it here?

                           I got a reply that located a menu handler
                           program. It is apparently written in Python and
                           it can be found here: Menu/Preferences/Main
                           Menu Editor
                           When I opened it it allows navigation to
                           different parts of the Main Menu tree so I
                           looked at the Programming subnode. Surprise!
                           Cervisia was present there and checked but
                           still it did not show up on the Menu. I even
                           rebooted after finding this but still no
                           Cervisia on the Menu.
                           Next I tried this:
                           – In Main Menu Editor I unchecked Cervisia
                           – Waited a bit (seemed like “something” was
                           being done
                           – Checked the checkbox again and closed the
                           dialog with the OK button
                           Amazingly now the Cervisia entry showed up in
                           the Programming submenu!
                           So to make an invisible newly installed
                           application show up you seem to have to do
                           either:
                           A) Install another GUI application, this makes
                           the previously installed program visible
                           or
                           B) Open the Main Menu Editor and uncheck the
                           missing program, then check it again
                           To me this sounds like a bug to me and this is
                           what I also reported in the Pi forum.

       Is anybody else experiencing the problem that after this process
       the user pi has no access to lazarus files?  I can’t install any
       components as user pi and in fact, lazarus doesn’t show up in user
       pi’s start menu.  If I run: sudo startx, then it comes up in the
       start menu and components can be installed, but I’m loathe to setup
       the RPi such that I have to run LXDE as SU.
       I’ve tried changing the permissions for everything in the
       /usr/local/share/lazarus directory, but that seemed to create new
       problems.
       Anybody else? What am I doing wrong?

            I login with root through VNC, so I cannot confirm the issues

            I’ve seen another user (BosseB) use the user “Pi”, maybe he

            I am following the discussion on the Lazarus mail list and
            while reading that I have realized that the procedure outlined
            here has to be modified regarding the permissions used during
            install.
            Basically what they say is that Lazarus should be installed by
            user pi rather than su. I am preparing to do so but I have put
            some questions there to clarify how I could rectify the way
            the installation is done now.
            But these seems to be the main steps after having built the
            fpc compiler on the Pi:
            Exit su mode to get to the pi prompt first!
# exit
$ mkdir /home/pi/development
$ cd /home/pi/development
$ svn co http://svn.freepascal.org/svn/lazarus/trunk lazarus
$ cd lazarus
$ make bigide  <== From Juha Manninen on the Lazarus list
            I don’t know how to get rid of the installation I did as su,
            so I cannot do the above just yet, but I will make a test
            later tonight.
            Mind you, I can use Lazarus as it is right now, but I have not
            tried to modify the IDE like you have so I did not run into
            that problem (yet).
            Concerning Pi access, I already found that I have to change
            the way VNC is installed in order to make it run as pi rather
            than root. That is not so difficult really, one just have to
            modify the procedure a bit and switch to user pi when starting
            up the VNC server.
            If you run Raspbian Jessie there are a few gotchas right
            there!
            1) The procedure to get the tightvncserver start at boot does
            not work because Jessie uses a different boot manager
            (systemd) where the way to start stuff apparently has changed
            a lot. Issue not yet solved. So after each boot I have to log
            on using SSH and start the VNC server as pi (I use a
            shell-script file for that).
            2) Any program installed in Jessie does not show up in the
            start menu until the next GUI program has been installed!
            However, there is a workaround for this:
            Open Menu/Preferences/Main Menu Editor and go to the
            Programming section. Here you will find Lazarus checked and
            yet it does not show up… Now, uncheck Lazarus, wait a few
            seconds and then check it again. Finally hit OK. Now you
            should find Lazarus on the start menu. I have asked about this
            on the Pi forum and it is confirmed as a bug.
            I will be back here and report the solutions once I am done
            with the new procedure.
            And another note for Jessie:
            Due to the size of Raspbian Jessie I failed to install Lazarus
            on an 8GB card. Ran out of disk space during compile…
            The minimum size for Jessie seems to be 16GB. And I had to
            change the boot sequence to boot into the CLI rather than GUI
            in order to do the compile step. Jessie defaults to boot into
            the GUI if one does not change it.

            Awesome write up BosseB! Thanks for taking the time and
            posting it here!
            I have not worked with Jessie yet … and not with systemd
            either haha …
            You’ve been searching quite a bit, so maybe you’ve already
            read this concerning systemd (both are TigerVNC related, but
            the regular vncserver probably starts the same way): Starting
            and stopping vncserver via systemd?  Or maybe this read
            concerning RedHat (works similar – it all starts to look very
            much Apple-like).
            I’m kind-a curious what the Jessie advantages will be over
            Wheezy …?

       Thanks BosseB.  Yes, I’m using Jessie as well and I found out about
       the 16gb the hard way.. It failed to make on the 2nd to last step
       so I had to start over with a larger sd card.
       For the Lazarus menu button, I had do what you said about the menu
       settings but then also reboot… it wouldn’t come back without the
       reboot.
       As for the permissions.. I’m running everything as root now.  If I
       have time, I’ll try to start over and install Lazarus after exiting
       sudo.  When I tried to change ownership of the lazarus directory to
       pi, I ran into a bunch of new problems, so it seems that
       reassigning the permissions after the fact is a little more
       involved.
       Thanks Hans for your time to document this.  If installing Lazarus
       as pi works, I’d recommend updating the workflow accordingly.
       Thanks again!

       Following advice on the Lazarus list I have now done this all as
       user pi:
       1) Renamed the old installation dir to disable it as follows:
sudo mv /usr/local/share/lazarus /usr/local/share/lazarus_old
       2) Create a folder /home/pi/development
       3) Check out lazarus trunk from subdir development into lazarus
       (got svn
       50059 this time)
svn co http://svn.freepascal.org/svn/lazarus/trunk lazarus
       4) Reconfigure Pi to boot to the command line interface to save
       memory
       and reboot.
       5) Go to ~/development/lazarus and run:
time make bigide
       This completes in about 17 minutes as reported by time
       6) Start tightvncserver and log on to the GUI via VNC
       7) Now try to run Lazarus. The Menu item does not work since it
       points to the disabled version.
       So I used the Menu/Preferences/Maqin Menu Editor to add a new item
       for Lazarus where I navigated to ~/development/lazarus/startlazarus
       as the command to run. I could not find a way to add the Lazarus
       icon to the command, though.
       When I now use the new Menu command for Lazarus it shows a big
       dialog telling me that it has detected a new Lazarus in use and do
       I want to transfer the settings to this Lazarus? I reply yes and
       then another dialog is shown where the file paths for Lazarus are
       checked to be OK. Then finally Lazarus starts up. I got another
       error dialog about some macros, which I don’t know the reason for.
       Seems not to make my program misbehave though.
       Now one can do a svn update in the lazarus dir and then rebuild
       Lazarus from its menu Tools/build Lazarus…
       The last step for me now is to remove the disabled version of
       Lazarus from the disk.

       Thanks BosseB and Chris,
       I’ll try Jessie in the very near future and take the tips from
       BosseB to rewrite it for the “pi” user (vs root).
       Maybe I see a few things that address the macro issue.
       I do recall however, that running svn might actually require root,
       and maybe that macro issue is the reason why.
       I have to go find my RPI2 again and make some time to do all the
       steps again.
       Thank you both for the excellent information!

            No, svn does not require root to run.
            I have used svn co to get the lazarus sources into the Pi home
            tree and it works just fine.
            Compiling lazarus as Pi also works fine, what I have had
            problems with now is to get Lazarus onto the Menu…
            After a number of iterations I found that Main Menu Editor had
            placed a number of start items for Lazarus under “Other”…
            Go figure…..

            Ah, then the root issue must be MacOS specific, my bad.
            Good to know that you’ve gotten it to work as “pi”, well minus
            the menu incident of course haha.
            If this is a bug, then you might want to start a thread at the

            Hi Don,
            thanks for recognizing that it takes a lot of work haha. Yeah
            even the smaller articles take up to 2 days of work (research,
            test and try, write, create graphics, and I translate it to a
            Dutch article afterwards as well). But I do enjoy it a lot  .
            Wish this could be my daytime job  .
            As for adding a menu item;
            Unfortunately I do not have a running setup at the moment
            (still catching up after my big move to Europe).
            Assuming Raspbian, as far as I could find (source or the
            source he used) – please let us know if this is helpful:

     How to add menu items to the start menu of your Raspberry PI?
     The menu files for the start menu are stored in the directory:
     /usr/share/applications
     (with the .desktop extension)
     Let’s say you want to add Processing to the ‘Programming‘ section of
     the start menu:
     rpi_startmenu
     create a 32 x 32 pixels .png icon for the application and save it to
     /usr/share/pixmaps/
     create a new desktop file:
     sudo nano /usr/share/applications/Processing.desktop
     enter the following lines of text:
     [Desktop Entry]
     Type=Application
     Name=Processing
     Comment=Processing programming language
     Icon=/usr/share/pixmaps/processing.png
     Exec=/home/pi/processing-1.5.1/processing

       I’m back with a different problem:
       It seems like using the trunk versions of FPC and Lazarus while not
       being part of the development community for fpc and lazarus is not
       recommended. One can be hit with various problems caused by recent
       code changes.
       So I wanted to switch to using the latest release of fpc (2.6.4)
       together with the latest release of Lazarus (1.4.4).
       But I did not want to go through the big hurdle of starting from
       scratch on a new SDcard…
       So I set out like this:
       1) I still have the 2.6.4 version of the fpc compiler on my system
       so I changed back the symlink to point to it:
sudo ln -sf /usr/local/lib/fpc/2.6.4/ppcarm /usr/local/bin/ppcarm
       2) Then I created a home for Lazarus in the pi home dir and
       downloaded the Lazarus release sources there (time as a leading
       command word makes it possible to see how long the process took):
cd /home/pi
mkdir lazarus
cd lazarus
time svn co http://svn.freepascal.org/svn/lazarus/tags/lazarus_1_4_4 1.4.4
cd 1.4.4
       3) Then I tried to build the Lazarus IDE:
time make bigide
       Unfortunately this ended after 2m27s with these errors:
/usr/bin/ld: warning: ./link.res contains output sections; did you forget -T?

       work on my Pi2 with Raspbian Jessie.
       Any idea why it fails? (I have posted the question on the Lazarus

            I’m not an expert, but it seems that you’re running into a
            linking problem.
            Did you try “make clean”?
            If I understand it correctly, it tosses all binaries of
            previously compiled units, forcing the compiler to recompile
            them, hopefully in the right version.

                 Well, there should not have been any old binaries in this
                 case because I am building bigide in a directory tha is
                 freshly checked out with svn, hence it does not contain
                 any binaries at all.
                 But I just did a make clean followed by make bigide. Same
                 errors

                 Could it be that the compiler is pointing to the wrong
                 sources?
                 I’ve had similar issues when trying to compile a newer
                 version for my Mac – it kept picking the wrong sources or
                 wrong compiler.
                 As for the issue with submitting a comment (which is
                 embarrassing and a pain): I have submitted a support

                 traveling the past weeks.
                 As soon as I get back home (end of this week), I’ll give
                 it a try and see …

            Look here:
            https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/entry/is_it_armhf_or_armel
            also googling around states that FPC was NOT compatible with
            ARMHF until 3.0 and Jessie is ARMHF while per the blog Wheezy
            was ARMEL
            By running the 2.6.4 distribution from the released SVN I bet
            the HF support was not added yet.  In the current Trunk it was
            likely added somewhere along the way and is official for 3.0

                 Here is where it says 3.0 finally support ARMHF
                 http://wiki.freepascal.org/FPC_New_Features_3.0#Support_f
                 or_the_armhf_EABI
                 Does this mean that if you compile with ARMHF in Wheezy
                 now it will have problems?  Does it really need a
                 different parameter (is ARMEL valid in FPC?)

       Do you know of a way to communicate serially using the Raspberry Pi
       2 GPIO serial UART from Lazarus?  I have read that TLazSerial does
       not work on RPI2.  Is there some other package for Lazarus that can
       do it?
       Thanks.

            Hi DonB,
            Oh, I did not know that.
            I am unfortunately not aware of an alternative either, mostly
            because I’ve never used TLazSerial.
            Do you know why TLazSerial is not working with RPI2?
            Not sure how helpful it is, since it’s from 2014, but I did
            find this rather extensive post at the Lazarus Forum. I do not
            believe it’s RPI2 specific, but it deals with some compile
            issues that might be helpful to get it going on the RPI2 as
            well.

            Well, I looked through the messages and can’t really determine
            what the problem might be.
            I’d recommend starting the process from scratch again – I know
            that’s probably not the “pro” solution, but I have found
            myself doing just that once or twice in the past.

                 Unfortunately I’m traveling for the next few weeks, so
                 I’m unable to test this myself.
                 Maybe it’s an issue in the latest FPC version (from SVN)?
                 Something goes wrong in “types.pp”, line 667. The
                 following output is most likely caused by that error.
                 Is there something before that, which might state
                 something more useful why “types.pp” is failing?

            If you used an 8 GB SDcard as the description here says and
            also used the latest RaspBian from the download site then
            chances are very high that you have run out of disk space!
            I did that mistake myself. You need at least a 16 GB card
            because the latest RaspBian is based on Debian Jessie and has
            a lot more stuff included than the older RaspBian based on
            Dabian Wheezy.
            Also the procedure described at the beginning is slightly
            different since RaspBian Jessie boots directly to the GUI
            after startup. To reach the configuration screen you have to
            start it manually. The GUI consumes a lot more RAM when
            running.

                 I have exactly the same issue as other forum members with
                 the fatal error connected to the file “types.pp”, etc.
                 I have read through quite a number of 2015 installation
                 articles on the web have:
                 – the latest Raspian Jessie image
                 – a 16GB card (I have expanded the distribution to fit
                 the entire space of the 16GB SDCard)
                 – a 1GB swap file
                 – deleted all unnecessary applications such as games,
                 Libre Office etc
                 – booted directly to the CLI (not the GUI)
                 – tried the procedure at least twice, but it always
                 generates a fatal error message when compiling after the
                 subversion trunk step (in response to the command ” make
                 all OPT=-dFPC_ARMHF”).
                 I’m at the end of the road at present.  Any suggestions?

                 Hi Eapperley!
                 Seems to have become a common problem, so I’m beginning
                 to suspect that this might be a bug in the subversion
                 code we pull down. I’m unfortunately nowhere near my
                 stuff (traveling), so it might be an idea to get a SVN
                 version of FPC, one version before the one SVN pulls as a
                 default. Not quite sure how that works though – maybe
                 someone has a suggestion?
                 I have no ability to test any of this [at this time], but
                 maybe this link might be helpful?
                 So we can go 1 or 2 revisions back …

                 I have not tested this, but after some looking around I
                 found this:
                 Checkout a working copy in REV revision (where REV seems
                 to be the revision number you’d like to grab):
svn checkout --revision REV http://svn.freepascal.org/svn/fpc/trunk
                 Update your local working copy to REV revision:
svn update --revision REV
                 The current trunk version seems to be 32601.
                 Or maybe we could try this approach (untested, early in
                 the morning, etc):
cd /usr/local/fpc
svn co http://svn.freepascal.org/svn/fpc/tags/release_3_0_0 source
cd source
                 (not sure if this will work though – I’m not the most
                 experienced SVN user)

            I have not tested this, and unfortunately I’m traveling so I
            don’t have my RPI with me:
            Lazarus Pascal standard comes with the SQLDB components, there
            you’ll find MySQL support. You’ll find more info in the
            Lazarus Pascal Wiki page related to this topic.
            DevArt offers MyDAC, which is commercial, and I did not test
            this one on a RPI either, but it definitely is one of my
            favorites. The Lazarus Wiki mentions that MyDAC is free for
            Lazarus but I could not find that particular free version and
            I’m not sure if they only offer the pre-compiled components
            (probably only suitable for Windows?) or actually the complete
            source code so you could recompile on your RPI.
            There is also the ZEOS component package, which is free and
            appears open source (SourceForge).
            If it were me, I’d test the SQLDB components first. If that
            doesn’t work [to your satisfaction], consider trying the ZEOS
            components.
            MyDAC is absolutely the best (under Windows anyway), but it’s
            commercial and not cheap.
            Hope this helps …

                      The SQLDb tab sits in my Lazarus 1.5 (built from
                      trunk rev 50059M) 7 tabs to the right of the tab
                      “Data Access”.
                      It contains many connection components for various
                      databases, like MSSql, Sybase, PQ, Oracle, ODBC, 6
                      different MySql versions, SQLite3, IB and FB.
                      How did you build Lazarus? Did you build using “make
                      bigide” or what? That is what I did in any case.
                      I am just in the process of switching to the FPC

                           Lazarus on my Mac, there is a small arrow
                           pointing to the right, on the very far right of
                           the component tool bar. This allows you to
                           scroll through the different component groups.
                           Even on my Mac I have to scroll

                           Hi.
                           After installing I have 9 tabs in my Lazarus. I
                           don’t have “SQLdb” tab after “Data Access” tab.
                           The next tab after “Data Access” is “System”
                           tab. I also try to use Debian Wheezy. But the
                           result is the same than Jessie.
                           I hope that some day the old Lazarus install
                           will be work again. Just a few commands and
                           everything works. :)

                           Hi Vermos,
                           I can’t verify this for the RPI at this time
                           (traveling), but on my Mac, the SQLDb tab is
                           one of the last tabs in the component window.
                           Even with full-screen I need to scroll using
                           the little-tiny-well-hidden arrow …
                           On my component window “System” indeed follows
                           “Data Access”.
                           “SQLDb” appears after “RTTI” (not sure if that
                           one exists on the RPI – I have never used it).
                           I apologize if this sounds repetitive, and is
                           what you already looked at, just wanted to make
                           sure …

                      And I had a look in Lazarus 1.2.4 which I also
                      installed in the RPi2.
                      The SQLdb tab is still there but even further to the
                      right, almost at the end.

                           I double checked but I have not SQLdb tab. But
                           I installed this from component library and now
                           it seems to be working fine. I don’t know why
                           this component are not installed automatically.

       FPC 3.0.0 and Lazarus 1.6RC1?
       I have tried to install the latest fpc 3.0 release and the release
       candidate for Lazarus 1.6, but it was not possible to complete.
       I wonder if someone has succeeded in doing it? I have done the
       exercise on an RPi2 with Raspbian Jessie where I earlier installed
       according to the description above (with modifications for user vs
       superuser).
       I basically used the method described here but checked out fpc
       release 3.0.0 and lazarus 1.6 RC1 via svn.
       FPC 3.0.0 was compiled using the bootstrap compiler 2.6.4 as
       described here and then I tried to make bigide in the lazarus
       sources.
       But it fails almost immediately with an error message:
(9009) Assembling lazaruspackageintf
/home/pi/development/src/lazarus/1.6.RC1/packager/registration/registerfcl.pas(4
5,22)
Fatal: (10022) Can't find unit process used by RegisterFCL
Fatal: (1018) Compilation aborted
       Is there anyone that can explain this? I have asked at the lazarus
       mail list but get only unhelpful replies.
       I even tried setting the syl´mlink for fpc back to the 2.6.4
       version but get the same error.

            It turned out that I received a reply on the lazaus mail list
            and it guided me to a working procedure.
            Here is how I did it in a Pi2 which had alredy older versions
            of fpc and lazarus running so all required extra stuff was
            already installed:
            1) Build the FreePascal release 3.0 compiler
            ————————————————————
            Download latest FPC sources:
cd ~/dev/src/fpc
svn co http://svn.freepascal.org/svn/fpc/tags/release_3_0_0 3.0.0
            Compile the FPC release compiler (using the bootstrap 2.6.4
            fpc compiler):
cd 3.0.0
make all OPT=-dFPC_ARMHF
sudo make install OPT=-dFPC_ARMHF PREFIX=/usr  <==Notice the use of /usr!
            Make the new version globally active by moving the symbolic
            link for ppcarm:
ln -sf /usr/lib/fpc/3.0.0/ppcarm /usr/local/bin/ppcarm
            2) Build the Lazarus IDE release candidate 1.6RC1
            ———————————————————————
            Download sources:
cd ~/dev/src/lazarus
svn co http://svn.freepascal.org/svn/lazarus/tags/lazarus_1_6_RC1 1.6RC1
            Compile Lazarus IDE 1.6RC1:
cd 1.6RC1
make bigide
strip -s lazarus  (reduces the size of the binary)
            Now one just have to create a new profile directory for this
            lazarus and then add it to the Jessie Main Menu.
cd ~
mkdir .lazarus_1.6RC1
            In the start menu item for lazarus 1.6RC1 one must enter the
            command as:
/home/pi/dev/lazarus/1.6RC1/startlazarus --pcp=/home/pi/.lazarus_1.6RC1 %f
            Then on first start of lazarus one has to enter the location
            of the fpc compiler and the fpc sources.
            Lazarus now runs fine.
            Note that the sources have been all collected into the
            /home/pi folder tree and sudo is only used when doing make
            install for fpc and thereafter creating the symlink that puts
            it on path on the system.
            PS:
            Is there a way to have this comment tool NOT make double
            spaced lines?
            It is extremely irritating that it shows code lines in
            separate code sections with whitespace inbetween  when I
            select a block of code and hit the code formatting button.
            And when typing normal text it does the same, every time I hit
            Enter it creates an extra empty line space between the
            previous and the new line. I have always to remember to hold
            down the shift key when I hit Enter to get to the next line
            without the extra wasted space…
            And that does not work for the code lines, which I have to
            backspace out and then use Shift-Enter to get a decent format.

                 Thanks BosseB!
                 Excellent info! I’ll get started with that right away
                 when I get back from my trip (somewhere in January).
                 As for the comment editor. Yeah it’s not always working
                 as smooth as I’d like to see it. Unfortunately, there are
                 not many “good” rich text editors for WordPress, except
                 for tinyMCE, which a pita to get running properly and
                 it’s relatively huge to load. But I’ll look into that one
                 again. This editor actually does everything HTML style,
                 so pressing ENTER = a hard line break, and shift+ENTER =
                 soft line break.
                 I’ll make it priority to get a better editor … sorry for
                 the inconvenience.

                      I’m putzing with the Rich Text Editor … the
                      WordPress default (tinyMCE) shows similar issues.
                      I’ll keep working on it ….

                 I tried this after trying what was in the main article,
                 but it didn’t work either. I started with a clean SD
                 again, but no luck.
                 When I run bigide it fails ie

                      Obviously you have the exact same error message as I
                      had. So the advice I received from one of the
                      developers of Lazarus should apply to you too.
                      Did you try the steps I outlined above? They solved
                      the problem for me at least. Notice specifically the
                      use of these fpc 3.0.0 compile commands which were
                      all executed as user pi (hence sudo in some places):
make all OPT=-dFPC_ARMHF
## NOTE: Use the PREFIX=/usr below
sudo make install OPT=-dFPC_ARMHF PREFIX=/usr
## Move the symlink to point towards the new fpc 3.0.0
sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/fpc/3.0.0/ppcarm /usr/local/bin/ppcarm
## Now deal with Lazarus...

                           Yep, I’d followed your instructions exactly
                           (given I’d had the same problem with the
                           original article..)  So I’m wondering if it
                           worked for you because you had an older version
                           floating around…
                           Did it twice – we a clean sd card install in
                           the middle – just to make sure, but it still
                           didn’t work…

                           Yes, my RPi 2 was not pristine. I had already 2
                           working fpc versions (2.6.4 bootsrtap and 3.1.1
                           from trunk as described earlier). Same for
                           lazarus, I had the old release 1.2.4 and trunk
                           which is 1.5.
                           So if there is something else that is also
                           needed it might lurk in the background…
                           I don’t have time to make a pristine RPi2
                           Jessie and do it from scratch right now, maybe
                           after the holidays in beginning of next year…

            I tried this process
            http://otapi.com/2015/02/10/raspberry-pi-2-freepascal-lazarus-
            and-delphi/ and it all worked fine.
            The only thing I had a slight problem with was lazarus wasn’t
            on the menu when I finished. I think it may have been because
            the ide wasn’t running when I did the install, so I turned on
            the ide, rebooted, re did
make all OPT=-dFPC_ARMHF
make install OPT=-dFPC_ARMHF PREFIX=/usr/local
            and then everything was fine, and it was on the menu. Got in
            and did a quick program, everything fine!
            So what I should do is go through that process, and the one on
            this web site, and see what difference made it all work… :-)

                 I have noted the following items on that process that I
                 feel are not really good:
                 1) The operating system is old, should be Raspbian Jessie
                 now and then an 8GB card will not nearly suffice. Must be
                 at least 16 GB. And the swap should be set to 1000 rather
                 than 500.
                 2) There is no need to go through the hoops of
                 partitioning the SDcard. The downloaded RaspBian Jessie
                 image is already partitioned, just write it to the SDcard
                 with Win32DiskImager and it is ready to go.
                 3) The TightVNC server should NOT be configured to run as
                 user root! It is generally not considered good practice
                 to run a computer routinely as root. Only those
                 operations that are needing root should be done as root
                 (using sudo)
                 4) For anyone that is not involved in developing FPC or
                 Lazarus themselves it is also not advisable to check out
                 trunk from svn. Much better to use a stable release
                 versions, these are also available via svn so the only
                 change needed for that is to go for another tag.
                 5) I also think that the sources should be downloaded
                 into the user pi home directory, for example
                 /home/pi/dev/src/fpc/<rev number> and
                 /home/pi/dev/src/lazarus/<rev number> respectively, and
                 then built there.
                 Then sudo make install will put them into the proper
                 common locations if needed (note that lazarus and fpc can
                 be perfectly well used from the home directory). An RPi
                 is usually not a multi-user system in practice so there
                 is no real need to provide for *all* users to run
                 Lazarus…
                 These are my views in any case….

                      1) I agree, and I ignored the OS instruction and did
                      have jessie, I also used a 32GB card, and 1200 for
                      swap (just to make sure.. :-)
                      2) I didn’t do that either
                      3) I didn’t do the VNC at all either, SSH is fine,
                      and my pi is plugged into a monitor anyway.
                      So (1) (2) (3) couldn’t be why it worked when the
                      one from here didn’t…
                      4) I DID get trunk (both this page and that one said
                      that), and it worked (could be for another reason)
                      where 1.2, 1.4, and 1.6 (all R1) didn’t….
                      5) I don’t think that would have made the
                      difference…
                      Now I’ve got it working I don’t want to touch it,
                      but I should go through each step changing one thing
                      at a time to see if I can figure out what made it
                      work..

            Hi Cyleen,
            This could be an issue on your end – the link works just fine
            here.
            Could it be that your ISP, or a proxy, is blocking this? (not
            sure why they’d even do that)
            Can you click the link you’ve posted directly in your browser?
            (http://svn.freepascal.org/svn/fpc/trunk)
            When I do that, it just opens the correct page.

                 Hi Cyleen,
                 That sounds correct. So you do have access to the link in
                 your regular browser, which means there is nothing
                 blocking access to the SVN sources.
                 Does your Raspberry Pi have a proper and stable network
                 connection?
                 You could also try the link in a browser on your
                 Raspberry Pi – just to test if the connect works
                 correctly.

                 hi again sir, i think the issue above has been solved.
                 But now after the ‘make all OPT=-dFPC_ARMHF’, it doesn’t
                 show a lot of messages as you said. I’d only get ‘make:

                      That message basically says that I doesn’t know what
                      to do with ARMHF as a target (for the compiler).
                      This is either because you made a typo, or because
                      the Free Pascal compiler installation didn’t go as
                      it was supposed to.
                      Double check for typo’s, or use copy and paste …
make all OPT=-dFPC_ARMHF
make install OPT=-dFPC_ARMHF PREFIX=/usr/local
make install sourceinstall OPT=-dFPC_ARMHF PREFIX=/usr/local

       Ok I wrote a script that installs FPC 3.0.0 Release and Lazarus 1.6
       RC1 on Jessie (full not LITE).   You can get it from the link in
       the instructions below.   Let me know how it goes.
       This procedure will NOT use the /usr/local folder as FPC 3.0.0
       seems to look for a few things during the compile that assume it is
       in the /usr/fpc folder and not the /usr/local/fpc. This means I
       don’t know how this will coexist with any pre installed versions of
       FPC and Lazarus in the /usr/local folder. The scripts was conceived
       assuming a fresh version of Raspian Jessie 11/21/2015 or newer (it
       may work on older versions but this is the first version of Jessie
       I downloaded)
       1) Follow the instructions in Step 1 above to install Jessie on
       your 16G or larger SD card. After Step 1 follow these instructions
       and run the script as explained.   I have run it several times and
       it succeeded every time on fresh Jessie SD cards.
       2) Boot the RPi with a network connection, monitor, keyboard and
       mouse connected
       3) [Menu>Preferences>Raspberry Pi Configuration] and click “Expand
       File System”, click OK to the message
       4) Click OK for the Preferences dialog and Yes to Reboot
       5) Open the web browser and download the script file from,
       “http://www.mustangpeak.net/install_laz.sh“, and place it on the
       Desktop
       6) Changing the swapfile size is NOT necessary
       7) Open a terminal window from the Task Bar (yes this can all be
       done from within the GUI!
       8) Type “cd Desktop” in the terminal window
       9) Type “sudo sh install_laz.sh” in the terminal window and sit
       back with a cup of coffee and answer a few questions along the way
       10) Answer all questions during the legacy FPC install with the
       default choices (this is different than explained in the tutorial
       above)
       11) Follow the last few line printed to the terminal window to tell
       Lazarus where to find the FPC sources

            Hi Jim!
            I had planned on writing a script like this myself once I had
            gotten all of the details ironed out. But now I don’t have to.
            :)
            Anyway I have a few comments:
            The script runs as su and installs both fpc and lazarus into
            the read-only (for user pi) location /usr
            But I found that when one uses Lazarus and installs some new
            packages it wants to rebuild Lazarus itself and this is a
            problem when I run Lazarus on a daily basis as user pi. All
            advice I have read about Lazarus is to place it below the pi
            home dir because then it will be writeable for user pi.
            So I will modify the script to place Lazarus into
            /home/pi/dev/lazarus and test it that way on a new Jessie.
            Concerning Jessie I will download the new image as you alerted
            me that there is a newer version available now. I have done my
            tests with the 2015-09-24 version, but my image currently is
            probably messed up due to the many tests I have done so a new
            fresh image is really needed  anyway. I would have done it
            today if I had gotten the time, lucky I didn’t so I had time
            to see your script post! :)
            Thanks for posting it!

                 Yes, I am not a Linux/UNIX expert by any means.  I was
                 hoping this would be the start of a community effort to
                 fix issues like this.   I was just trying to “make it
                 work”.  Since it takes a good hour to execute the entire
                 script on my DSL many tests take too much time.   In
                 Wheezy, and how Hans describes it above, I have my custom
                 component set I compile into Lazarus all the time with
                 Lazarus installed in /user/local/lazarus.  I alway run as
                 the normal “pi” user all the time as well.
                 I have not tried the component set it with Jessie and
                 this install yet though.

                 I just synced up my component repository and installed
                 the components into Lazarus.  The IDE recompiled fine
                 under /usr/Lazarus while logged in as the Pi user.  I

                 I am preparing my attempt at using a modified script
                 which uses sudo internally when needed so the script
                 itself can be executed by pi.
                 But since I did not know how shell-scripts really work I
                 made a test script just to test if one could use sudo
                 inside a script:
echo Creating directory testing as pi
mkdir testing
cd testing
ls -la
echo Creating directory sutest as root
sudo mkdir sutest
echo Trying to enter sutest as pi
cd sutest
ls -la
pwd
echo press Enter to quit
read junk
echo Done!
                 What happened when I ran this is that it proved that it
                 is possible to switch to root using su for specific
                 commands.
                 The directory sutest is owned by root as was the goal.
                 So I will use this approach when I modify your script.
                 Now I will just have to save the work I have done in the
                 current image to somewhere I can access it when the new
                 image is running the Pi…

                           Awesome, would be great if we’d create a
                           “universal” script like that yes …!

                 Awesome guys!
                 You are doing all the work and by the time I get back
                 home from my trip it will be all ready haha.  Just
                 kidding
                 Please share the script when done … I’ll look at it by
                 the end of this week.

            I have made a first test using my slightly modified script in
            a brand new Raspbian Jessie (latest image). I did not even
            install tightvnc, instead I have a monitor and keyboard/mouse
            connected to see the desktop.
            The script ran for quite a while but it finished with errors.
            But the errors were hard to see because the script chugged
            along even if a command ended erroneously, so I will have to
            add error checking into it.
            One error was surely caused by lack of swap, so step 6 saying
            swap could be left as-is seems not to be right. I could not
            compile manually either until I increased swap to 1000. Then I
            could manually run each command in the script file to a
            successful end.
            In some places there is supposed to be user interaction (hit
            enter on questions) but no questions appeared it when running
            in the script, it just continued running. Has to be
            investigated.
            So I will add error checking after each command and I will
            look for the missing stops for user input.

                 Yes it does need error checking.  The swap is very odd.
                 I have built at least 6 SD cards without touching the
                 swap size including one last night using the ARMV6
                 switches.

                 I cannot definitely say that it is swap, but when the
                 script had run and there was no fpc installed (no symlink
                 in any case) I tried running the command to compile fpc
                 manually and again it failed after a while. Since I
                 recognized the behaviour I had a look at swap and it was
                 set to 100. So I changed to 1000, rebooted and repeated
                 the manual build, which now succeeded.
                 One item I am struggling with is the fact that the user
                 interaction seems to be missing. Only at the points where
                 there is a command:
                 read junk
                 in the script itself will it stop.
                 But when for instance the 2.6.4 installation script is
                 executed there are user entry stops when manually run but
                 not via the script.
                 Is there some setting somewhere that tells the script to
                 forward “internal” user input requests to the real user?
                 It might be this problem that made the run fail.
                 Note that I am trying to run the script as user pi by
                 including sudo inside the script wherever needed.
                 I have never written shell scripts for Linux before so I
                 might have done some error here. Of course lacking error
                 checking makes the process just run on even when a vital
                 part has failed…
                 I got some info on error trapping in scripts here so I
                 have tried to include these procedures inside the script.
                 Next problem is how to reset to a known starting point
                 where there are no traces of the tests done so far.
                 Probably need to wipe the SD-card with a fresh image and
                 start over from scratch….

                 I was wrong about the user input prompts! Failed memory…
                 They appear all right!
                 I have now checked the script with my modifications on a
                 brand new Raspbian Jessie SD-card (32 GB) with swap set
                 to 1000.
                 During this test the script had a number of stop points
                 so I could check the state of things along the way.
                 All went fine and Lazarus 1.6RC1 appears on the start
                 menu as intended. My error traps are there but were not
                 activated this time around. No errors occurred.
                 I will now clean up the script and then publish it.
                 I will relocate stuff so that all apt-get commands are
                 collected together as well as the file downloads before
                 the real action is started.

                 Now I have tested the script and restructured it so that
                 it can be easily adapted to install other versions in the
                 future.
                 It installs FPC as root into /usr just like the original
                 script does, but Lazarus will be installed by user pi in
                 /home/pi/dev/lazarus and a menu entry is set up for that
                 location.
                 The script now contains error checking for virtually all
                 commands executed inside and it will abort when an error
                 is detected while showing which line number the error was
                 detected on.
                 Furthermore I have collected the commands into groups:
                 – Start by doing all system updates via apt-get
                 – Then download all of the files needed for the install
                 (seed compiler, fpc sources, lazarus sources)
                 – Next install the seed compiler and then build and
                 install fpc 3.0.0 as root
                 – Now build the Lazarus bigide
                 – Finally create the Lazarus entry for the Jessie start
                 menu
                 The modified script is available online here. I changed
                 its name to install_laz_pi.sh.
                 Notice that in my experience the swap should be increased
                 to 1000 as follows before running the script:
sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile
change as follows:
CONF_SWAPSIZE=1000
                 Then reboot the Pi

                      Hi,
                      Great work!  I did not need to change the swap size.
                       I have also updated it to ask a question to compile
                      for the ARMv6 (All Pi Models) or ARMv7 (Pi 2 only).

                           Jim,
                           I wonder how you have set up the Pi2 while
                           installing via the script?
                           Did you disable booting into the GUI by any
                           chance?
                           In earlier versions of Jessie at least I tried
                           to see if only booting to the command line made
                           a difference, and it did. If the GUI was not
                           started then the swap setting did not need as
                           high a value. But if I did not change anything
                           in Jessie regarding boot then it boots into the
                           GUI and apparently that consumes a fair amount
                           of memory, which makes a bigger swap size
                           necessary. Anyway it could be tested again of
                           course but the cycle is fairly long when
                           starting from a new SD-card, so I think I don’t
                           have the time anymore. With a fair size SD-card
                           1000 MB of swap is not all that bothersome
                           either….
                           But I guess I could change the swap and then
                           just rebuild Lazarus (that is where the swap
                           made a big difference before).
make clean
make bigide
                           should be the two commands needed for this.
                           BTW, the script I posted is not the same as I
                           ran to completion! After I succeeded I
                           rearranged the commands to collect all
                           downloads in one place before starting
                           installing and building, and this was not
                           tested…
                           So there might be a typo somewhere even though
                           I was careful when I moved text around.

                           I went ahead and changed swap back to 100,
                           rebooted and executed:
make clean
make bigide
                           in the Lazarus source dir. The main build took
                           15m27s and succeeded.
                           I could compile and run a “Hello World” program
                           just fine.
                           So it looks like if one uses a big SD-card
                           (mine is 32 GB) and Raspbian Jessie from Nov
                           21, 2015 there is no need to increase swap.
                           You were right! :)

                           end.   All I did was instead of using the first
                           wait for “junk” I use it to type in ARMv6 or
                           ARMv7 and compile to the different processor if
                           wanted.

       Just tried this, and all appeared to go well, but there is no
       “Lazarus” option under Menu->Programming.
       Downloaded script onto 32GB SD card with latest Jessie, changed
       access permissions to allow execution, then executed script by
       typing “./install_laz_pi.sh”
       Should I have prefixed that with “sudo” ?
       As I said the script appeared to run to completion, and it did
       create the
       “/home/pi/.local/share/applications/lazarus-test.desktop” file.
       Any thoughts on what I’ve done wrong ?

                 1) No you should not use sudo. The purpose of my script
                 changes was to make the script itself use sudo wherever
                 needed and otherwise not.
                 I wanted it to put the lazarus sources inside the pi home
                 so they could be updated easily.
                 2) The Jessie menu system is really frustrating…
                 I have struggled a lot with it and finally I thought I
                 found a working way to get the darned menu items onto the
                 menu. The script makes a desktop file that should be used
                 by the menu handler. It works for me but apparently not
                 for you..
                 What I can suggest is the following:
                 – Open the file
                 /home/pi/.local/share/applications/lazarus-test.desktop
                 in nano so you see the commands inside it
                 – Select the menu command: Preferences/MainMenuEditor
                 – In the window that pops up select the “Programming”
                 node
                 – Then use the “New Item” button to bring up a dialog
                 – Fill in Name and Comment as you like but copy the Exec
                 command from the desktop file in to the Command field
                 – Click the box in the upper left part of the dialog,
                 this brings up the Icon setting. Copy the Icon item from
                 the desktop file to here
                 – Now hit OK and wait a while until all settles (takes
                 upwards of 10s)
                 At this point you should have a Programming menu item for
                 Lazarus and quite possibly two (the one deposited may
                 have been activated now).
                 The menu handling is really shaky in Jessie in my
                 opinion.
                 By the way the actions above will have created a desktp
                 file alacarte-made.desktop in the applications dir. Why
                 it uses such a strange name is beyond me.

            Thanks for the link AndyW!
            But that link is already listed under the “additional
            resources” below the article  .
            It’s a very good article though! Thanks for highlighting it

            Notice that FreePascal is now on release 3.0 and Lazarus 1.6
            was released Feb 18, 2016 and uses the release version of
            FreePascal.
            So in order to get these onto the Raspbian Jessie system on an
            RPi2 the best way is to use Subversion to download the releaee
            sources into directories named after the version numbers:
svn co http://svn.freepascal.org/svn/fpc/tags/release_3_0_0 fpc_3.0.0
svn co http://svn.freepascal.org/svn/lazarus/tags/lazarus_1_6 lazarus_1.6

            In order to build fpc 3.0.0 you need to have seed compiler
            2.6.4 as described in the tutorial above.
            But the fpc make all command will run a final pass using
            itself so the resulting fpc will have been compiled with fpc
            3.00 too.
            After all that is done and the fpc symlinks are fixed as
            described you can go as pi to the lazarus_1.6 dir and issue
            make bigide and it will build just fine.

                 Thanks BosseB!
                 I know some users here were working on a script –
                 unfortunately, I didn’t get around to testing any of
                 those yet.
                 Is there a script yet that uses “the latest”? Or any way
                 we can capture that in a script, so it always does the
                 latest version?

                      I was doing that and there was additions made by
                      Jim.
                      I have now reconfigured the script with the new tag
                      values. It is available here.
                      But I have not used it myself after this change
                      since I already have all the other needed stuff….

                           just the Pi2(ARM7) or for all the Ri Family

                           Hans,
                             Could you put this somewhere like GitHub and
                           make you, BosseB and myself contributors so we
                           can keep it updated in a single place and have
                           a link to it above in an obvious place? with
                           the notes that with Jessie several of your
                           steps up there are not necessary such as you
                           CAN installed from the default GUI in Jessie,
                           and you DO NOT need to increase the swapfile
                           size.

                           Hi Jim,
                           I think I got the script from you and then I
                           modified it a bit to get Lazarus installed
                           inside the Pi home and such.
                           In any case the last change I made was done in
                           the config section to define the tag to
                           download for Lazarus and where to deposit the
                           files. Nothing changed in the body.
                           Hopefully it is useful for some Pi users! :)

                           Hi BosseB
                           I then updated YOUR script, I am running
                           Lazarus from within the Pi user based on your
                           script now.  I added the switch for the ARM
                           version to your base script.
                           http://www.mustangpeak.net/install_laz_pi.sh
                           This one should be the latest and greatest with
                           all our merged work, unless you had updated you
                           since you posted it.

                           I have modified your script ONLY in the config
                           section where I redefined the LAZDESK, LAZTAG
                           and LAZVER variables to reflect the release
                           version and its tag values.
                           So subversion download will use tag lazarus_1_6
                           and download into dire 1.6
                           Then the desktop file will become
                           lazarus.desktop
                           Everything else stays the same.

                           Thanks guys for the great work!
                           As for posting it on Github – Maybe that’s
                           something either of you would like to do. After
                           all, the credit goes to you guys for working on
                           the script.
                           I’m wondering if we can modify the script in
                           such a way that it will always pick the latest
                           and greatest?
                           We could pull the tags directory, ignore all RC
                           versions.
                           Or … even write a small app that handles this
                           with a GUI? Allowing updates as well and such?

            That is a typo in the URL (should be two e in freepascal).
            Don’t know from where it came but it is not in my version of
            the script in any case.
            The script can be downloaded from my provisional server.
            I have modified it by adding an apt-get command pertaining to
            making SqlDb calls against MsSQLServer work.
            So with this script Lazarus will be ready to roll with such
            database accesses too.

            Were you able to download my script from the link I shown?
            If that is OK then it might be a problem accessing the
            freepascal svn site from Iran.
            Try to go to this location in your browser:
            http://svn.freepascal.org/svn/fpc/tags/
            You should get to a list of all existing freepascal tags.
            If that works then there is a problem with the way svn works
            from your end, but I am not able to help further in that case.

            The Pi 2 uses a ARMv7 CPU, where as the older models use a
            ARMv6 CPU.
            I have never tried running it on an older Pi – maybe recompile
            it on an older Pi?
            Anyone have experience with this?

            Hi,  which script did you run?  I am not sure if BossB
            implemented my small change that asks when you install Lazarus
            if you want to compile for just the ARMv7 (Pi2) or all the Pi
            family (ARMv6 and ARMv7).
            This is mine and will ask you to enter ARMv6 or ARAMv7 while
            it runs.

                 The script I am linking to from my temporary webpage did
                 include your modification with the ARM selection.
                 But now I have improved a bit on the script so that it
                 offers a default value (ARMv7) so if this is OK the user
                 just has to hit Enter.
                 If the user wants to change to ARMv6 he just backs off 7
                 and enters 6 instead.
                 I also added apt-get for a database connectivity library
                 to make Lazarus able to talk to MSSQLServer databases
                 “out of the box”.
                 And I restructured the sequence so that the seed compiler
                 is downloaded and installed before the big downloads from
                 svn happen. This way the user interaction with the seed
                 compiler installation comes before the downloads…
                 Finally the script is configured for the release versions
                 of both fpc and lazarus.

       Hi all
       Great work !
       Thanks for all.
       I got a new RaspberryPi 3 and installed Ubuntu Mate on it.
       I try to run the install_laz_pi.sh and it breaks in the beginning
       (apt-get update) indicating an error in dpkg.
       I solved it and run again. It does’nt work due to some missing sudo
       :
       – sudo svn … in line 88,
       – sudo mkdir … several times.
       I manually run each command and it finished (/usr/fpc with both
       2.6.4 and 3.0.0 versions, home/pi/dev/lazarus/1.6RC1 populated and
       /home/pi/.lazarus_1.6RC1 empty).
       The only “strip -s lazarus” command gives an error.
       I manually create the lazarus-test.desktop (I cannot succeed to put
       it in the /home/pi/.local/share/applications folder which was not
       created ! I created it manually).
       I put a launcher in the desktop, but it displays an error when
       running.
       It seems that startlazarus.sh is missing.
       What is its contents ?
       Thanks a lot for your help.
       Best regards.

            Hi Ahmad,
            took me a bit to look this up, but as far as I know with:
apt-get -s install lazarus-1.6
            More info in the Debian documentation (look at paragraph

            You might have to mention the source, and I have not tested

                 “SID”!
                 When I run “apt-get -s install lazarus-1.6” on Raspberry
                 Pi, it shows:
                 E: Unable to locate package lazarus-1.6
                 E: Couldn’t find any package by regex ‘lazarus-1.6’

                 I’d have to play with a Pi to test … I think your apt-get
                 source is not having this package.
                 Not sure what ‘SID’ is (sorry for the ignorance).
                 I have not played enough with apt-get to determine how to
                 switch sources.
                 Either way, I’d think you’d end up getting the sources
                 and have to compile both compiler (FPC) and Lazarus.
                 Maybe someone more experienced with the Debian packages
                 can assist?

            This blogspot is really about installing FPC/Lazarus from
            sources and not using binaries precompiled by someone else….
            So did you read and follow the instructions and advice
            available here?
            And why go to Debian for something specifically geared towards
            a Raspberry Pi?
            (Trying to post for the second time…)

       After some investigatio, it seems that this very nice doc is
       deprecated (April 2016)
       FPC does not compile is version 3.0.0 is not installed and there
       are no binaries for ARM…
       LAZARUS compile fails here :
       svn2revisioninc.pas(791) Error: Error while linking

            I just took a quick look, but FPC 3.0.0 is indeed still
            available for ARM, see also this post in the Lazarus forum,
            where Raspberry Pi bundles are announced.
            I have not tested these yet, but it looks promising and
            suitable for multiple ARM processors:
ARMV3
ARMV4
ARMV4T
ARMV5
ARMV5T
ARMV5TE
ARMV5TEJ
ARMV6
ARMV6K
ARMV6T2
ARMV6Z
ARMV6M
ARMV7
ARMV7A
ARMV7R
ARMV7M

       Indeed this is OK,  I did get-apt install fpc and lazarus, it works
       But when I compile a single pascal application with lazarus I have
       an error and the application crashes (External: SIGSEGV).

            Hi Cyril,
            Well, since they posted this in the Lazarus Forum, I would
            assume a build can be made on your Raspberry Pi as well (steps
            described here and you probably do not need to download
            anything if you installed the bundle from the Lazarus Forum).
            It also opens the door to ask questions in that particular
            Lazarus Forum topic.
            The crash makes me think that maybe the wrong processor is
            defined?

            Hi Stefan,
            this guide is already a little older, and it seems you’d need
            the FPC 3.0.0 compiler to get started.
            In this step:
mkdir /usr/local/fpc
cd /usr/local/fpc
wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/freepascal/files/Linux/2.6.4/fpc-2.6.4.arm-
linux.tar
tar xvf fpc-2.6.4.arm-linux.tar
cd fpc-2.6.4.arm-linux
            We would need to get FPC 3.0.0, however when looking for 3.0.0
            I could not find one for ARM (Raspberry Pi).
            So we should probably get FPC 3.0.0 sources (after downloading
            2.6.4) and compile those before we can work with the latest
            version.
            The sources can be found here:
            https://sourceforge.net/projects/freepascal/files/Source/3.0.0
            /
            I will have to go find a Raspberry Pi and try this to
            determine the exact steps.
            You could give this method a try, maybe they are more up to
            date than they used to be:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install fpc
sudo apt-get install lazarus

                 i gave your method a try
                 i got fpc ver 2.6.4
                 and lazarus ver 1.2.4
                 durng first run i got a error message
The package EditorMacroScript (pascalscript macros) has detected a problem and w
as deactivated.
The package failed its selftest with the message:
"Failed getstr2 [Exp: "456" / Got: "abc"]"

                 but the IDE started as I am used to from other systems
                 I will test and play around with it in the next days
                 bye

                      glad to hear you’re making progress. I did found
                      that message on the Lazarus Forum (see this

                      It does not seem critical (you might want to disable
                      it to prevent future error messages).

       Thank you for this great tutorial
       I’ve got one comment to this:
       This procedure won`t work anymore cause the compiling of the new
       repository/trunk of the latest svn of the FPC requires the
       FPC3.0.0. version at least.
       To complete all you’ve got to install a minimum 3.0.0. version
       first.
       Refer to this link, where you can get this:
       http://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php?topic=30647.0
       So don’t install the 2.6.4 otherwise the fpc command will conflict
       with the 3.0 version. Take the 3.0 from the link, install it with
       the setup.sh and don’t forget to set the PATH instructions so that
       the fpc will be available in the system. Afterwards proceed as you
       described in your tuttorial.
       Thank you and Greets

            Hi Dylan,
            you’d indeed need the latest FPC compiler 3.0.0. (see also
            BosseB’s post step 1 – on how to get FPC 3.0.0)
            I have not been able to test or update this article. AFAIK
            you’d need 2.64 (which you already have) to update to 3.0.0
            before building Lazarus.
            Alternatively, you could get it from GetLazarus.org as well.
            Hope this helps.

                 I am going to modify the script on my blogpage so it gets
                 a seed compiler v 3.0.0 for ARM (Raspberry) by putting
                 the compiler itself without any other stuff in a tar file
                 on my site and directing the script to get seed from
                 there.
                 I have been rather busy lately so I have not had time to
                 check the way it will work yet, but as soon as it is done
                 I will reply here with the new script.
                 Note: I am extracting the ppcarm file from the GetLazarus
                 package since apparently all one needs as a seed is this
                 file. But I need to test it before releasing the
                 installer script.

                           After hours of attempts and failures I have
                           finally got FPC 3.0.0RC2 installed with Lazarus
                           1.6RC2.
                           I followed your tutorials exact instructions,
                           except when downloading the FPC source from svn
                           I used:
http://svn.freepascal.org/svn/fpc/tags/release_3_0_0_rc2/
                           Instead of:
http://svn.freepascal.org/svn/fpc/trunk/
                           That way I knew I was going to compile version
                           3.0.0 using 2.6.4 instead of using 2.6.4 to
                           compile one of the nightly releases (which are
                           later than 3.0.0, therefore canoot be compiled
                           by 2.6.4). Which was causing the error from the
                           very beginning.
                           In the end these steps worked for me:
                           After following all the steps to install FPC
                           2.6.4:
cd /usr/local/fpc
svn co http://svn.freepascal.org/svn/fpc/tags/release_3_0_0_rc2 source
cd source
make all OPT=-dFPC_ARMHF
make install OPT=-dFPC_ARMHF PREFIX=/usr/local

       I just want to reveal that I have put the 3.0.0 seed compiler for
       RPi2-RPi3 on my website.
       This means that the installer script needs to be modified to grab
       that seed compiler than the 2.6.4 version from SourceForge.
       Here is how:
       In the section about downloading and installing the seed compiler
       replace the existing lines with this:
cd /usr/fpc || error_exit "$LINENO: Cannot access directory /usr/fpc! Aborting"
sudo wget http://blog.boberglund.com/projects/freepascal/files/Linux/3.0.0/fpc-3
.0.0.arm-linux.tar  || error_exit "$LINENO: Cannot download seed compiler! Abort
ing"
sudo tar xvf fpc-3.0.0.arm-linux.tar || error_exit "$LINENO: Cannot expand tar f
ile! Aborting"
sudo rm fpc-3.0.0.arm-linux.tar
sudo ln -sf /usr/fpc/ppcarm /usr/bin/ppcarm || error_exit "$LINENO: Cannot creat
e symlink to new fpc compiler! Aborting"

       Remove the other lines dealing with the 2.6.4 seed compiler such as
       running the install.sh script.
       Note: I have not tested the script with the change above, I am
       working on a total overhaul of the script so it will no longer need
       sudo and it won’t install anything outside of the user home dir
       (/home/pi/).
       You might need to add the option FPC=/usr/bin/ppcarm to the make
       commands, but I think that the symlink should be enough.

            I have now tested it and it turns out that 2.6.4 is still
            needed to build FPC 3.0.0 as a seed compiler.
            So I have uploaded another file to the website containing this
            and nothing else. It makes the download a lot smaller too and
            my site seems to be faster than SourceForge in my tests. The
            download command is:
wget http://blog.boberglund.com/projects/freepascal/files/Linux/2.6.4/fpc-3.0.0.

            Thanks BosseB!
            I was already afraid we’d otherwise had to go to 2.6.4 ->
            3.0.0 route, but having it available like that is much easier

                 Notice that the only file needed for a seed compiler is
                 ppcarm itself, no other files are needed to build FPC
                 itself.
                 And to be sure one can specify FPC=<path to ppcarm> on
                 the make command line, so a symlink is also not needed.
                 Once that has been done and FPC 3.0.0 is present one can
                 rebuild FPC using itself too. But the make program senses
                 that FPC has not been built yet and then it REQUIRES
                 2.6.2…

       I can report a strange new problem with Lazarus on a RPi3 with
       Raspbian PIXEL (the latest version of Raspbian):
       When one starts Lazarus main top window uses only about 60% of my
       screen width and there is no way I can resize the window either!
       Even the maximize button is disabled, so one cannot change the
       width of Lazarus at all…
       The other windows are normal and resizable as expected.

            Since I bought a Pine64 when I should have bought a RPi3, I
            better go order one to test this.
            That sounds like a strange and not very practical issue …

            I have now checked that this is a problem with Lazarus 1.6.2
            and is reported by others as well on the lazarus mail list.
            Lazarus 1.6 on the same system does not behave this way. It
            resizes as expected.

       Update on the installation system:
       I have now verified that Lazarus and FPC can be installed on a
       Raspbian RPi3 in such a way as to keep everything local below
       /home/pi and therefore no sudo or such things are needed.
       I updated my installation script and made it available on my
       website:
       This script relies on svn to get the sources of both FPC and
       Lazarus and it uses a 2.6.4 seed compiler from my site since that
       is the only acceptable seed to build FPC 3.0.0 with. When FPC 3.0.2
       is out it will need the 3.0.0 seed, which is also available (just
       edit the script and change 2.6.4 to 3.0.0 in the line that fetches
       the tar file).
       All dependencies and tools needed are installed by the script too,
       so it works on a brand new installation.
       Advice:
       It puts the binaries into /home/pi/bin, which is created if it does
       not yet exist. This dir is automatically added to path by Rasbian
       if it exists when one logs on. So the best way is to create the bin
       dir if it does not exist, then log off from the system and log on
       again. Now /home/pi/bin should be on path.
       The script will fix the path if bin is not existing so the
       remaining parts of the script will work, but it is not permanent.
       So therefore the procedure above is recommended.

            This is what you must do:
            Assuming you are running on VNC straight on the Pi. You will
            need to do a find and replace in the FPC config file.
            So if you’re running VNC or if you’re using the Pi’s HDMI out
            you will use LeafPad to do so:
            $ sudo leafpad /etc/fpc.cfg
            The file will now open in leafpad.
            Look for the section labelled:
# -----------------------
# Set Filenames and Paths
# -----------------------
            You need to see if your Compiler is looking in the right place
            for it’s dependencies.
            For instance, in my case, the path for the first file will be:
#-Fr/usr/local/lib/fpc/$fpcversion/msg/errore.msg
            But in your case it might be:
#-Fr/usr/lib/fpc/$fpcversion/msg/errore.msg
            You need to make sure that all the paths in your file are the
            same as mine.
            Meaning:
            /usr/lib/fpc
            must be replaced with
            /usr/local/lib/fpc
            To do this click ‘Search’ and then ‘Replace’.
            In ‘Find What’ type ‘/usr/lib/fpc’ (Or whatever your path may
            be)…
            In Replace with type ‘/usr/local/lib/fpc’
            Click ‘Find and replace’.
            Save and close the file.
            It should work now…
            If not it means your FPC sources are somewhere else. You need
            to find them and then fix the paths in the fpc.cfg file.
            Because that is the only reason you will receive the error
            message.

       I have a major challenge. I bought the Raspberry Pi 2 yesterday.
       While trying to install freepascal, I get errors at stage:
       make all OPT=-dFPC_ARMHF
       “Makefile:2911:  *** The only supported starting compiler version

       Is there an easy fix for this compiler version issue?

       Got the same error message while building Lazarus:
       ‘Can’t find unit db used by fcllaz’
       There is a bundled script one can use to generate the .fpc.cfg file
       (it was missing after building fpc 3.1.1), for me the script is
       located at:
       /usr/lib/fpc/3.1.1/samplecfg
       After writing out .fpc.cfg, i added paths to it under ‘# searchpath
       for units and other system dependent things’:
       -Fu/usr/lib/fpc/3.1.1
       -Fu/usr/lib/fpc/3.1.1/*
       -Fu/usr/lib/fpc/3.1.1/units/*
       -Fu/usr/lib/fpc/3.1.1/units/arm-linux/*
       Then Lazarus can be compiled.
       It would be nice to handle the above hassle in BosseB’s script.
       If you are getting ‘Can’t call the resource compiler
       “/usr/bin/fpcres”, switching to external mode’, then you are on low
       swap file:
       Change ‘CONF_SWAPSIZE=100’ from 100 to 2000 in
       ‘/etc/dphys-swapfile’ then reboot.

       Hey There! Has anyone tried compiling a project originally created
       under Windows? I followed the instructions given on this site and
       I’m able to compile a simple project in Lazarus under a Raspberry
       Pi 2. I’ve imported a project I’ve been working on in windows to
       try and compile to for the raspberry but when I click “run” the
       execution stops with a “Error while linking”. Any idea what might
       be wrong?

            Hi Oscar,
            I have done something similar; build my application under
            MacOS X and then recompile on the Raspberry Pi.
            The “error while linking” might refer to a unit or file that
            might not be supported on the Raspberry Pi.
            Do you have more details about the output?

                 Thanks Hans! Unfortunately it doesn’t say anything else.
                 It simply says “Generic Linking Error” with no additional
                 output as to what might be causing it. I assumed it has
                 something to do with some unit clashing with the OS or
                 something, but can’t really tell which because I have no
                 additional information.
                 Is there a way I can single-out which units I want to
                 compile? I can only set which “Forms” I want lazarus to
                 build/compile. However units are always compiled. If I
                 could somehow choose which units I want lazarus to
                 compile, I could maybe check where this linking error
                 might be occurring.
                 Thanks anywa!

                      Nevermind, I figured it out. The “linking” error was
                      caused by some libraries that weren’t compatible
                      with my linux distribution. The IDE wasn’t throwing
                      any library-related error when compiling, and it
                      wasn’t pointing to any library in particular. What I
                      did was the following:
                      1- Removed all units from the project inspector
                      2- Add them again
                      3- Do a clean/build of the IDE (I’m inclined to
                      believe this was the ONLY thing needed, but I’d
                      clean/built it before and nothing changed so I’m not
                      100% sure)
                      After trying to compile (following the clean/build)
                      the IDE was showing me exactly which libraries were
                      causing the linking issue. Wrapping things between
                      {$IFDEF WINDOWS}{ENDIF} did the trick. The “error
                      while linking” is no longer an issue.
                      Thanks for all! If it wasn’t for this tutorial, I’d
                      have never gotten lazarus to work on my RaspBerry.

                      Awesome, glad to hear you found those libraries – it
                      can be a pain to find that one single little file

       problem though referencing the rtl directory.
       On startup, Laz displays:
Directory: /home/pi/dev/fpc/3.0.0/rtl/
Error: directory rtl not found
You can download FPC and the FPC sources from http://sourceforge.net/projects/la
zarus/?source=director
       OK, I saw the bit in the article on that but the directory
       reference on my startup screen after I browsed to it is
/home/pi/dev/fpc/3.0.0/rtl
       Also tried /home/pi/dev/fpc/3.0.0/rtl/linux
       Still no-go
       What am I missing?

       I just want to confirm that my script Install FPC and Lazarus on
       RPi3 works fine also for FPC 3.0.4 and Lazarus 1.6.4 on Raspberry
       Pi3B running Raspbian Jessie.
       As is outlined in the comments you have to edit the configuration
       items to set the new versions as follows:
# Location of Lazarus start menu entry for Raspbian Jessie
LAZDESK=/home/pi/.local/share/applications/lazarus_1.6.4.desktop
#Fpc and Lazarus tags and versions
FPCTAG=release_3_0_4
FPCVER=3.0.4
LAZTAG=lazarus_1_6_4
LAZVER=1.6.4
       The seed compiler needed is still the 3.0.0 which the script will
       download automatically from my website.
       Furthermore the svn commands should be modified to use https rather
       than http.
svn co "https://svn.freepascal.org/svn/fpc/tags/$FPCTAG/" "$FPCVER"
svn co "https://svn.freepascal.org/svn/lazarus/tags/$LAZTAG/" "$LAZVER"
       Notice that the script installs FPC and Lazarus into the Pi home
       directory, i.e. it is not a global install.
       This makes it easier to configure and use as well as to modify the
       compiler and IDE.

            Hi Bo
            Don’t know if this page is still working but I take a chans.
            I tried to instal FPC and Lasaruz on a new pi3 with jessie,
            using your script. Everything went well for a long time until
            Lasaus was compiled and I got the following lines that 2
            errors during the compilation. When I used to program ( many
            years ago, I’m 68 now) a compilation error was normally due to
            an error in the code.
            what can be wrong? any Idea? iI haven’t bee able to figure out
            where in your script this sequese is started, so i don’t have
            a clue about the problem.

                 It looks like you are using a Pi that has been localized
                 to Sweden, this is what I have never tried to do.
                 So this might be one issue here, even though I really
                 doubt it.
                 The place where this action is started from is near the
                 bottom of the script itself, right after the line:
                 echo “Compiling Lazarus, first clean files from earlier
                 attempts”
                 There are two make calls here, one for “clean” which is
                 usually not needed if this has beena fresh download from
                 svn, but would be needed if you want to rebuild the IDE.
                 The final make is this:
                 make bigide “OPT=$OPTIONS” “FPC=$LOCALBINDIR/ppcarm”
                 Here the variables $OPTIONS and $LOCALBINDIR are expanded
                 to the settings earlier in the script file.
                 It looks like it did not find the assembler, and went
                 over to use some other executable it could find:
                 /home/pi/dev/lazarus/1.6/ide/lazarus.pp(150,42) Error:
                 (9008) Can’t call
                 the assembler, error -1 switching to external assembling
                 Question:
                 It looks like you are trying to install Lazarus 1.6 here,
                 this should be changed to a later version since 1.6 is
                 quite old now. The latest stable is 1.8.4 and 2.0 is soon
                 to be released.
                 I cannot see which version of FPC you selected, but the
                 latest stable here is 3.0.4
                 In both cases there are fixes branches that could be used
                 to get the best release version if you like too.
                 The script is configured on top for these values so you
                 can use nano on the Pi to edit these to later and better
                 versions like this:
                 # Location of Lazarus start menu entry for Raspbian
                 Jessie
                 LAZDESK=/home/pi/.local/share/applications/lazarus_1.8.4.
                 desktop
                 #Fpc and Lazarus tags and versions
                 FPCTAG=release_3_0_4
                 FPCVER=3.0.4
                 LAZTAG=lazarus_1_8_4
                 LAZVER=1.8.4
                 If this does not help you might want to join the Lazarus
                 mailing list and ask for assistance there concerning the
                 specific problem. I have posted a question there now.

                      Got a reply from the Lazarus list that brought back
                      old memories…
                      The problem could be caused by lack of swap space on
                      your RPi3, even though I doubt it.
                      You can check it in any case, so on a command prompt
                      (example from my RPi3 with FPC/Lazarus installed):
$ free -m
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:           925        487        438         35         92        218
-/+ buffers/cache:        176        749
Swap:           99          0         99
                      Here you see swap at 100 MB, which is the default.
                      This had to be set to 1024 on older RPi units to be
                      able to build Lazarus.
                      It could be done like so:


                      1
   sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile<br>   Edit the
   line:<br>CONF_SWAPSIZE=100<br>   so it reads:<br>CONF_SWAPSIZE=1024<br>
     save and exit (Ctrl-O then Ctrl-X)<br><br>Restart the swap
   service:<br>sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile stop<br>sudo
   /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile start<br><br>

                      Thanks a lot for the tips.
                      it worked after swapfile was increased. If that was
                      the problem, I don’t know,  but after reinstalled OS
                      and started all over againg with a bigger swapfile
                      it worked OK.

   Since one of my WordPress plugins seems to have been ghosted by it’s
   developer, I had to develop my own plugin. Not a big deal, just a lot
   of work.

   For this I wanted to use Ajax calls to retrieve data.
   Reading up on WordPress and using Ajax, I found it difficult to find a
   complete and working example.
   Even the WordPress Codex example produced a “400 (Bad Request)” (you
   can see this in the console of your webbrowser).

   So, once I figured it all out, and got it to work, I decided to
   dedicate a short article on a quick and easy working example on how to
   get started with Ajax in WordPress by using PHP, JavaScript and jQuery.

   I hope others benefit from this, potentially saving you a lot of time
   to get started.

   As a hobby developer, when testing dark theme vs light theme under
   MacOS X, I have those moments where I have to switch back and forth
   between both themes quite often.
   Going into the System Preferences to toggle theme, choosing the
   Appearance option, and then selecting the desired theme, does indeed
   work, but I wanted just a “one click” theme toggle.

   To help myself with that, I created a small application that does
   exactly this: it toggles to “the other” theme, with just a simple
   click.
   So when Dark Theme is active, it switches to the Light (Aqua) Theme. If
   however the Light Theme is active, it switches to Dark Theme.

   The application is super simple, and has no interface. Just start the
   App and it changes theme and then closes itself.
   Normally, this App would just sit in your Applications directory, with
   the optional shortcut in your Dock or even on the Touch Bar (if your
   Mac has one).

ApplePi-Baker 2.1.6 Update – Bug fix release

   ApplePi-Baker 2.1.6 Update – Bug fix release

   ApplePi-Baker is build specifically for MacOS, to make backups or
   restore images (IMG).
   Initially intended for Raspberry Pi users, this tool can be used for
   plenty other applications as well.
   For example flashing LibreElec or disk for ODroid, making backups of
   photography SD cards, etc.
   All this is done in the same format as used by the command line tool
   “dd”.

   ApplePi-Baker supports a nice list of compression formats.
   For making backups: 7Zip, tbz, tgz, tlz, txz and Zip.
   For doing restores: 7Zip, bzip, gzip, ISO, Jar, lzip, rar, tar, tbz,
   tgz, tlz, txz,xz and Zip.

   Besides supporting compression, ApplePi-Baker can also resize a Linux
   partition to make it fit on your target disk (depending on the amount
   of used data in the partition of course) or minimize your backup to
   what is really used on the disk.
   Note: Resizing only works for regular MBR disks with a standard
   partition table.

   After some major changes in ApplePi-Baker 2.1.x, I’ve released version
   2.1.6 today which fixes some minor issues.

   To list a few:
     * Access Violation error when showing advanced view when there were
       no supported drives available
     * During resize (shrink or expand partition), ApplePi-Baker couldn’t
       find the temporary file on occasion (thanks Loe and Wolfgang!)
     * ODroid resize issue resolved (thanks Götz!)
     * Improved stability for partition resize (shrink/expand)

   At this moment one bug remains open, and that is when there is not
   enough disk space on your Mac to do a backup and/or resize.

   Download the latest version of ApplePi-Baker from the original article:
   ApplePi-Baker v2 – Backup & Restore SD cards, USB drives, etc.

   If you run into any issues, bug, or errors using ApplePi-Baker, then
   please report these with the original article as well.

ApplePi-Baker v2.1 Update – Faster and Expand or Shrink IMG

   I’m very excited to announce that ApplePi-Baker now supports
   shrinking and expanding of Ext2, Ext3 or Ext4 Linux partitions on a
   Mac!!
   This is something I wasn’t able to do before and is commonly seen as a
   challenge on a Mac (since MacOS does not support these Linux File
   Systems).

   This update can only shrink or expand Linux partitions on a MBR
   partitioned disks (very common format used for the Raspberry Pi).

   Keep in mind: I’ve done quite a lot of successful tests, but by lack of
   beta testers, I’m still marking it as experimental.

   During backup, if the option has been enabled, ApplePi-Baker will
   locate a Linux partition and if found shrink it to it’s minimal size,
   and update the IMG file and it’s partition table (the source will not
   be affected). This will result in a much more compact IMG file, and
   offers a restore to a device of a different capacity.

   On Restore, this same option will expand that Linux partition to the
   maximum available size on the target disk.
   Obviously, the target device needs to be able to accommodate at least
   the minimum size of the IMG file.

   Since quite a bit needs to be done (find partition, check file system
   integrity, resize partition, etc), this will naturally slow down the
   backup and restore process, but it will help restoring to different
   sized target disks/SD-card.

   Not only that, version 2.1.0 is much faster than 2.0.0 – I’ve seen
   speed increases up to 300% during backup.

   You can find the latest version of ApplePi-Baker in the original
   article (please place comments there).

   ApplePi-Baker has become well known amongst Raspberry Pi users, with a
   Mac running macOS, to backup and restore SD-cards. Users do not just
   use ApplePi-Baker for this purpose anymore – I have seen users use it
   for backup and restore of pretty much anything not Raspberry Pi
   related.

   Late 2013, I created ApplePi-Baker for my own use – I just got tired of
   looking up the proper command-line statements.
   This way, ApplePi-Baker became my personal frontend for command-line
   tools like “dd“, “diskutil“, “mount” etc.

   Over time, the use of command-line tools came with some problems;
   thanks Apple for changing command-line tool output with every new
   version of macOS. Besides that, having to enter your “sudo” password
   each time was a pain as well, and came with the occasional problems for
   a small group of users, so that had to go as well.

   About 2 years ago I decided to rebuild ApplePi-Baker from scratch, no
   longer using any of the command-line tools. This came with quite a few
   challenges, especially since Apple increased security for macOS, not
   allowing me to do certain things straight from my program (see also
   SMJobBless: Elevated Privileges in Lazarus Pascal). I’m not even
   mentioning the drama when it comes to supporting the different
   compression formats, signing applications, and 64-bit requirements.

   Almost 2 years later, I proudly present ApplePi-Baker v2.
   [t4a_smug.png] – special thanks to Jeff and Mark for testing!

   UPDATE: ApplePi-Baker now also support shrinking and expanding of Linux
   partitions!

   As some of you know, I created ApplePi-Baker a while ago, and with a
   new version I wanted to get away from using command-line tools like
   “dd” and “diskutil“. To do this the right way I needed to know how to
   use SMJobBless, in order to get root access, a.k.a. elevated
   privileges, privileged helper tool, etc.

   Back in the day, we could do this pretty easy in our application,
   simply by using opening, reading and writing data from/to disks as
   “files”, with relatively simple code in our applications. These days
   seem to be gone …

   With all kinds of malware trying to “hack” us, companies like Apple and
   Microsoft keep making it increasingly more difficult to actually get
   admin (root) access straight from our application (not to mention the
   seemingly cumbersome signing of applications). Which is all good, just
   too bad that the now majority of the time I spend on developing an
   application involves adapting to these limitations, instead of doing
   the creative thinking towards what the application really is for.

   Apple has created a poorly documented mechanism for this, referred to
   as “SMJobBless” or “Privileged Helper“, and focusses heavily on
   Objective C and Swift – neither of these I like, let alone working with
   XCode (yuk!) – I really prefer working in Pascal, and specifically in
   an awesome IDE provided by Lazarus Pascal.

   So in this article, I’m documenting my own findings to get this working
   with Lazarus Pascal – which took a lot of work and testing.

   Keep in mind – I’m definitely not an expert on this topic, and I tried
   to include as much of what I found out as possible. It appears no-one
   has done this with Lazarus Pascal yet, so please bear with me, and
   definitely feel free to post improvements and/or suggestions. I’m sure
   there may be better ways and I’m always open to improving things,
   including myself.

   Apple has done a pretty good job with the Dock in MacOS. There is just
   one thing that I do not like though; the way it stacks icons when you
   add a folder to your Dock.

   A smart guy from Japan (2007 – Yasushi Chida) actually came with a neat
   idea for that, by introducing “buckets” (or better said: Stack
   Overlays) placed over the folders in your Dock. All that without the
   need to install any extra applications!
   Unfortunately, his website at Yahoo!/Geocities has been gone for quite
   a while now.

   The few steps you have to take can be a little bit challenging for
   MacOS beginners (even though it is pretty easy – as usual; once you
   know how it works). So in the article I’ll show you how to use buckets
   (a.k.a. Stack Overlays) in your MacOS Dock. This seems to work as of
   MacOS X Leopard and still works in Mojave (and I do expect this to work
   in future versions as well).

   Some of you may be familiar with the problem … no sleep button on your
   keyboard.

   You have a really nice Mac, but you’re using a Windows keyboard since
   there is no MacOS keyboard that you really like.
   I’m using a keyboard from Havit (you can find it here).

   One of the things I hate about this setup is that I have no key or
   key-shortcut to put my computer to sleep.
   When you look at the Apple reference, you’ll only find keys that cannot
   be found on your Windows keyboard, like the Eject key, or the Power
   key.

   So in this article, I’ll show you, without the use of special software,
   how I have created a keyboard shortcut to put my Mac Pro to sleep,

   Working with scripts in Bash (Terminal or Shell) isn’t what I do daily.
   The day I had to create a script to help me do an SVN update followed
   by a massive recompile. I wanted to see the SVN result first before
   proceeding with recompile, so I had to add a “Press Any Key To
   Continue” option in the script.

   Since it took me a little effort, I figured; let’s describe this in an
   article. After all, it may be good reference for myself and for others.

   Waking up devices that are network connected, can be done with the so
   called “Wake On LAN” feature provided by certain devices (like for
   example a NAS, FileServer, or even a PC). A while back I created a
   simple application for this – miniWOL – keeping in mind that the user
   may not be too familiar with all the configuration details (see:
   previous miniWOL versions).

   I wanted just a simple menu in the System Tray (Windows: next to the
   clock, usually the lower-right corner of your screen) or Menubar (MacOS
   X – top of your screen, Linux often at the bottom of your screen).
   Well, after a bit of searching I could not find anything suitable or to
   my liking and I decided to just write something myself.

   The old miniWOL been good so far, and plenty folks seem to have a good
   use for it privately and professionally. However, Apple had to change a
   few things (moving to 64 bit, using Cocoa instead of Carbon, and the
   need to sign applications – unfortunately Microsoft will probably
   follow soon) so while revamping the Mac version, I revamped the Windows
   version as well, and added a 64-bit Linux version as well (by request).

   Rename My TV Series, a tool to rename tv series episodes, has been
   around for a while now, and it’s time for an update (the “old one” can
   still be found here). So I proudly present: Rename My TV Series 2.

   Two of the main reasons for this new version are the needed update of
   the user interface and support for the new API of TheTVDB.com. But
   there is more; macOS users wanted a 64 bit version to avoid the 32 bit
   complaining and having the application signed was on the wishlist for
   them as well. Support for SSL (since theTVDB.com API requires this),
   the use of notifications and the support for a dark theme, the merging
   of 2 episodes, caching results, are a few of other desired or needed
   items.

   I’m still striving to do as much cross-platform development as
   possible, so macOS, Windows and Linux users can use my tools, which
   means that this new version will be available for all these 3
   platforms.

   easier ways to make empty dummy files.

   In this article I’ll show you how it can be done under Windows (incl.
   DOS and PowerShell), Linux and macOS.

pfSense 2.x – How to fix Strict NAT for XBox One

   I’m always up for playing with new toys, and this time I did build a
   firewall using pfSense. I wanted to play with OpenVPN and my NetGear
   R7000 Nighthawk (running Asus xWRT) capped out at 5Mbps. So I migrated
   to pfSense.

   However, doing so, my XBox One decided to not like this and detected
   STRICT NAT – which results in limitations with online gaming.

   In this article I’ll show you how I fixed this with pfSense so NAT now
   shows as OPEN (keep in mind that I’m NOT an expert).

   Note: This may apply to PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, XBox 360 and
   other consoles as well.

Lazarus Pascal – Custom Fonts for MacOS Applications

   I’m not sure about other developers, but I occasionally like to use my
   own custom font for my Lazarus Pascal applications. Typically I do this
   so I have access to better icons and symbols available in my
   application, instead of semi blurry bitmap icons. If you use this the
   right way, your icons and symbols will look much better and will scale
   really great.

   Usually, I use a TTF font for this which I generate at IcoMoon.
   IcoMoon is an awesome website where you can compile your own TTF font
   (or SVG or PNG images of symbols) for use with your website
   (Tweaking4All uses it as well) or … in your applications.

   Since there are plenty examples out there how to do this in Lazarus
   Pascal for Windows, here an article that shows you how to do this
   in Lazarus Pascal under macOS.

QNAP – How to set the VNC Password for Linux Station

   QNAP – How to set the VNC Password for Linux Station

   For modern and more powerful QNAP devices, you can now run a complete
   Linux environment on your NAS. In this case by using Linux Station
   which basically runs a Ubuntu variant.

   Since Linux Station is not really running as a virtual machine, it runs
   pretty fast. You can even hookup a HDMI monitor and a USB mouse and
   Keyboard to your QNAP and use it as a workstation. But most of us do
   not use their QNAP that way. Instead you can access Linux Station
   through their webbrowser, or … VNC.

   VNC access comes with a challenge though. What the heck is the
   password? No matter what you do in the remote desktop settings, the
   password is fully ignored.

   In this short article I’ll show you how to set a password – albeit in a
   not so conventional way.

Arduino – All LEDStrip effects in one (NeoPixel and FastLED)

   If you’ve read the article I wrote a while ago “LEDStrip effects for
   NeoPixel and FastLED“, then you might have noticed quite a few requests
   to combine all these effects in one single sketch.

   I have seen some users come up with some nice examples, but the
   challenge remained (for me): how do I instantly toggle from effect to
   another?

   Well, today I’ll have such a sketch available for you; it allows you
   toggle between effects with a simple switch.

   Ever needed to help a friend or family with their computer issues with
   remote access? Quick Assist is the way to go for Windows 10 users for
   remote assistance!

   If you’re reading this, then there is a good chance that you’re looking
   at the same challenge I have every now and then; a friend or family
   member is having issue with their PC and if you can please help them …
   like right now! In that case (or when you live on a different
   continent) remote access is the way to go, unless you’re pretty close
   by.

   In the past I used LogMeIn, it was probably the best tool I’ve every
   used for remote access, but unfortunately it’s no longer free or
   affordable.

   For a while I’ve used TeamViewer, but in all honesty – I really dislike
   how the tool works even though it is free. The fact that both parties
   need to install software and those funny codes, weird screens, and
   sometimes confusing settings – well, it’s just not for me.

   This weekend I had to assist my nephews, both of them using Windows 10.
   And again I was stuck with the same question: what tool to use?
   Well not entirely … seems Windows 10 is equipped with everything we
   need and in this article I’ll show you how it’s done.

   For those of you working with JavaScript, and the ability to store some
   data on the client side (browser) with the help of Cookies; here a
   short description what cookies are, what kinds there are, and how to
   work with them.

   Since I rarely use it, I keep forgetting the details, so I figured;
   well, put it on my website so I can find it again when I need it in the
   future and maybe others will benefit from this as well.

   It really is an easy process, and I’m honestly surprised that
   JavaScript and jQuery do not offer some simple functions for this right
   out of the box. For jQuery several cookie plugins can be found – just
   too bad it’s not right away included.

   Outfits like Google, Let’s Encrypt, cPanel and Comodo are pushing for a
   more secure Internet.
   Obviously there is nothing wrong with that, and I commend them (and
   others) for pushing and supporting for this.

   In this case we are talking about adding a so called SSL certificate to
   websites, allowing encryption, which can be identified by the url
   starting with “https”. In other words making the good old and regular
   “http” protocol secure.

   In the past one would have to pay yearly to keep the SSL certificate
   valid, for every single domain, or pay even more for so called wildcard
   certificates. But, for basic purposes, this is no longer the case (for
   commercial use one still will have to pay for a certificate) – thank
   you Let’s Encrypt and Comodo for providing those free certificates.

   Now keep in mind though that we have nothing critical here at
   Tweaking4All that would need encryption. However, in the push for
   website owners to start using encryption, Google has seemed to have
   gone the route where their browser will display messages that may look
   misleading to the end-user, for those website that do not support
   encryption. Not even mentioning the possible negative Google ranking
   impact for websites that are not encrypted.

   So I’ve spend the better part of this weekend to implement SSL/HTTPS on
   Tweaking4All as well – it has caused some problems, and possible
   downtime and odd behavior of the website in the past 2 days. My
   apologies for that … you should now see a green “Secure” message near
   the address-bar of your browser.

   Please feel free to report issues, or moments where this does not show
   a green “Secure” indicator – it’s not impossible that I overlooked one
   or the other small piece.  [t4a_smile.png]

   Previous miniWOL versions proved that just reading the specifications
   of Wake on LAN and testing with your own equipment is not going to
   result in a 100% perfect application, as it seems that certain machines
   prefer to see a broadcast over the network instead of a specific IP
   address.

   In this new version, you can still retrieve the Mac Address based on IP
   address, and use a broadcast mask (255.255.255.255 is the default).
   This should help with certain setups like Synology devices.

   This update applies to Windows and MacOS versions of miniWOL.

   Note: I have just uploaded a revised v1.2 (Friday Dec. 9 2016) which
   fixes sending a WOL when miniWOL starts for those servers that have
   been tagged as such.

   Read the original MiniWOL article. Comments, bugs, question etc, can be
   posted there as well.

   I like dabbling with Lazarus Pascal, a free IDE for developing Pascal
   programs for Windows, MacOS X and Linux, quite similar to Delphi.

   One of my projects, would look great with a weather forecast, so I went
   an figured out how this works by accessing the Yahoo Weather API. This
   took me a little bit to figure out, but I’ve got it running now, even
   using https.
   This week I decided to put it all in a small unit, so others can use it
   as well.

   This unit only needs Synapse, which is free as well, and uses fcl-json,
   which comes with Lazarus.

   ConnectMeNow, a small application for Mac OS X to quickly mount network
   shares, has been updated to version 1.7.9 – yes i’ts an odd version
   number, but this has to do with a lot of testing by Steffen and others.

   Some of the changes include:

   Support for separator lines in the menu, buttons to move items up and
   down in the list, support to save the config file anywhere you’d like
   (they can even be shared with other computers, for example through
   DropBox etc.), option to backup/restore your config file, “Execute
   AutoMount” function, menubar fix for macOS Sierra, fixed bug which
   would reset the number or shares to zero (= loosing all settings!),
   standard preferences are now stored per Apple Guidelines, and a minor
   bug in WOL has been fixed.

   For  download of the latest version, please read the original article
   (Quickly connect Network shares on a Mac with ConnectMeNow), where you
   can also ask questions or report issues. Or … find the application on

   For most of us, working in Linux or in a shell is not necessarily a
   daily activity, and that’s totally OK.
   I’m not daily working with it either, but occasionally I use one of
   those funny commands to set the access rights to certain files and/or
   directories.

   This command, chmod, is not super complicated to work with, and is
   commonly used when working in a shell or terminal on both the MacOS X
   and Linux platforms. But we need a “magic number” to set these rights.
   The “magic number” for chmod is also commonly used with FTP programs.

   Whenever I use this command, I need to refresh my mind on how to
   calculate the “magic number”, and I find myself looking for a chmod
   calculator.
   Since I’m lazy at times, I figured: why not have one on my own website?

   So I started playing with JavaScript and created this chmod calculator.

   A new version of Name My TV Series is available, version 1.8.0, with
   quite a few new features.

   For those who followed the comments and forum posts, you will have seen
   some new features popup. This is the main reason why I ended up
   skipping the 1.7.x version numbers – thank you Collin for taking the
   time to test and thank you CDRSteve for the motivational beers!

   Some of the new features include folders, setting airdate for folders,
   detection of video resolution (720p, 1080p, etc), video codec, and
   audio codec, and history drop-downs for file-naming, directory naming,
   and previously loaded shows.

   For the most recent version, go to the original Name My TV Series
   article, or our Download-page.

   Occasionally I have those FTP jobs to either download or upload a truck
   load of files – for example when I want to make a backup of my website.

   Now you could start a regular FTP client on your PC and have it run all
   night to do just that, or … you could use your QNAP for that – mine is
   running 24/7 anyway, so why not? The biggest issue is: where do you
   find a FTP client that can download or upload entire directory
   structures?

   Download Station, and the likes, only take one URL at a time, or other
   apps do silly things like zipping all files before up- or download (who
   came up with THAT idea?).

   After a long search I found something interesting; One of the best
   hidden features of File Station, the file manager in the web-interface
   of your QNAP, is the fact that it supports FTP … albeit poorly
   documented and hard to find … in this article: how do we do this with
   QTS 4 (tested with QTS 4.2.1). Note that this only supports regular
   FTP, so not SFTP!).

   When running Windows on your Mac through BootCamp, you might be
   searching for the CD/DVD Eject button every now and then, and back in
   the day (2009) I wrote a little application for that for my own use:
   BootCamp CD Eject.
   This application works with all Windows version as of Windows XP –
   and you can use this without BootCamp as well.

   This little application lives in the Windows Systray and allows you to
   eject a CD/DVD from a menu or through a key combination. There is
   also a key combination to quickly put your Windows in standby.

   I’m posting the application (free!) since I recently ran into some
   users that actually had a use for it even 7 years after developing it.
