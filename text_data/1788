Support

   First of all, check that your question is not already in our FAQ.
   Then, you can submit a support ticket at the inria helpdesk portal
   (inria account is mandatory). On this portal, select "IT support
   request", then "ask for a fix" or "service request", and then select
   "services for research", then "inriaforge". You can also submit a
   support ticket by mail at address sed-forge.helpdesk-prc at inria.fr
   (this is the way to go if you don't have an inria account).
   The old support email address help.et.gforge at inria.fr is an alias to
   sed-forge.helpdesk-prc at inria.fr.
   When submitting your request, don't forget to provide accurate details
   of what's going wrong. Read, for example, How to Report Bugs
   Effectively.
   Finally, you can also have a look at our bug tracker.
