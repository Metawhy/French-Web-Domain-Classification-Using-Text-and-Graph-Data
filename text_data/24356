Customer Quotes

     * ActionLogic is a great company to work with. Their Association
       Runner management tools are a wonderful resource for our members
       and make it easy for new members to join. I highly recommend their
       solution for any association.
       John Adams, Director of Technology for the California Society of
       Municipal Finance Officers
       ActionLogic was instrumental in working with our association to
       provide us the services needed to accomplish a very large task of a
       re-design. Wow, they took it to the next level and accomplished
       what I had envisioned for the Oregon Municipal Finance Officers
       Association. Thank you for such a wonderful job!
       Michelle Hawkins, President of OMFOA.

   How Can ActionLogic Help You?
   Whether your business needs a wireless application, web application, or
   an entire e-commerce site, ActionLogic can help. We are experts at
   designing applications that are fast, easy to update, easy to navigate,
   and work on a variety of browsers and platforms. At ActionLogic, we
   don't design electronic brochures, we put the web to work for you.
   Managed Server Solutions
   Are you fed up with your ISP? Are you thinking about co-locating your
   own server, but are afraid of the costs involved? ActionLogic's managed
   server solutions may be the answer for you. For a monthly fee, you can
   lease Dell PowerEdge servers from us and let us take care of setting up
   and maintaining your web sites and applications. It's like having your
   own IT department at a fraction of the cost.
   Your Business Can Use the Web to Cut Costs
   It's about information and getting that information to the people that
   need it in a cost effective manner. Utilizing Allaire Corporation's
   Cold Fusion web application server technology, your sales staff can be
   just a 'click' away from vital customer information, information they
   may need to close a big deal.
