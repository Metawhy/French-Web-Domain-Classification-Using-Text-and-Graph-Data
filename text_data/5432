   New research out of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
   finds that physically active adolescents are not only improving their
   health – they also are decreasing the chance that they will get into
   trouble.Among teens who fare well are skateboarders, particularly
   regarding their self-esteem and despite a lack of wide public support
   for this activity.

   The study found that teens who participate in a wide variety of
   physical activities, particularly with their parents, are at decreased
   risk for drinking, drugs, violence, smoking, sex and delinquency,
   compared to teens who watch a lot of TV.

   “Adolescents who spend a lot of time watching TV or playing computer
   video games tend to be at higher risk for engaging in all of these
   risky behaviors,” said study co-author Dr. Penny Gordon-Larsen,
   assistant professor of nutrition, a department housed jointly in UNC’s
   schools of public health and medicine, and a fellow at the Carolina
   Population Center.

   “Anything we can do to get kids to be physically active will help them
   in terms of their physical health, but this research suggests that
   engaging in a variety of activities may also have social, emotional and
   cognitive benefits, including reduced likelihood of engaging in risky
   behaviors such as drinking, drugs, violence, smoking, sex and
   delinquency,” Gordon-Larsen added.

   The study is published in the April issue of the journal Pediatrics.
   The first author is Dr. Melissa C. Nelson, who received her doctoral
   degree from UNC and now is assistant professor of epidemiology and
   community health at the University of Minnesota.

   The study compared seven distinct clusters of adolescents, defined
   according to the types of physical or sedentary activities they
   participated in frequently. These clusters were identified in 2005 by
   Nelson and Gordon-Larsen, and UNC professors of nutrition Drs. Linda
   Adair and Barry Popkin.

   “Our previous research revealed physical activity and sedentary
   behavior patterns that vary among teens, and these activity patterns go
   beyond highly active and not active,” Nelson said.

   Examples of clusters include:
     * Adolescents who frequently played sports with their parents, who
       also spent a lot of time playing sports overall;
     * Skaters/gamers, who did a lot of skating, skateboarding, bicycling
       and playing video games;
     * High TV/video viewers, who made their own decisions about TV
       viewing and did a lot of it;
     * Teens who often use neighborhood recreation centers; and
     * Adolescents who often participated in school activities, including
       sports, clubs and physical education.

   The current study also asked questions about self-esteem, finding that
   risk of low self-esteem was lowest for the cluster of adolescents
   engaging in sports with their parents.

   The remaining clusters were groups of adolescents who often used
   community recreation centers, as well as the group who participated
   frequently in school activities. Both also tended to have high
   self-esteem, compared to adolescents who watched a lot of TV.

   The risk was similarly low for the skaters/gamers. Skateboarding may
   get a bad rap, since schools don’t generally sponsor it, many public
   places ban it and not a lot of adults participate in it. “But we found
   that adolescents who skateboard actually fared well in terms of
   self-esteem and were less likely to engage in risky behaviors compared
   to teens who watch a lot of TV,” Gordon-Larsen said. “I think that
   parents should find ways to participate in sports and physical
   activities with their children,” Gordon-Larsen said. “So, instead of
   having family TV time, build in time that the family is together and
   active.

   “It’s also extremely important for communities and schools to provide
   safe and affordable recreation facilities and opportunities for
   physical activity,” she added.

   At this point, Nelson said, researchers still trying to understand all
   of the benefits of being active. “This research leads us to believe
   that those benefits extend well beyond physical fitness. It could be
   that active teens are being exposed to more opportunities for
   team-building, engaging in more social interactions with others, or
   seeing the benefits of hard work and practice.”

   “We also suspect that all teens might not benefit similarly from the
   same kind of activity – it’s not a one-size-fits-all kind of thing.
   Helping to provide kids with the opportunity to get involved in any
   number of physical activities, instead of staying at home and watching
   TV, may provide a kind of resilience against engaging in these other
   risky behaviors.”

   Funding for the research came from the National Institute of Child
   Health and Human Development of the National Institutes of Health and
   from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
