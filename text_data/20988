The Story Behind the WWW Hypertext 91 Demo Page and UNC and me

   In 2013, we got a lot of nice coverage of my rediscovery of perhaps the
   earliest World Wide Web pages. In honor of Internaught Day August 23,
   2016 — the 25th aniversary of Tim Berners-Lee making the WWW code
   publicly available, I’m reposting the story behind that oldest page
   here.

   Fact is that those pages — Tim Berners-Lee’s Demonstration Page for
   Hypertext 91 and my own personal page — have been on the net almost
   continually since they were developed and/or modified on my NeXT cube
   during Tim’s visit to UNC in the late Fall of 1991 on his way to San
   Antonio and the ACM conference in December 1991. While the pages have
   moved from server to server as we upgraded, the pages mostly worked
   just fine even in modern web browsers without modification. True, there
   are HTML tags that are strange to us now: DD, DT, DL, NEXTID, and a
   requirement that each A link have a NAME field. (place
   view-source:http://ibiblio.org/pjones/old.page.html and
   view-source:http://ibiblio.org/pjones/old.paul.html in Chrome to see
   the old school html unrendered).

   But how did those pages get created and how did they end up in Chapel
   Hill on my NeXT in first place?

Apollo Guidance Computer on ibiblio

   Screenshot of AGC

     I got the idea while watching the movie Apollo 13. The instant in
     the movie where the AGC is powered up on Earth approach is the
     instant when the viewer suddenly feels that survival of the
     astronauts has changed from “highly unlikely” to “very probable”. It
     gives me a chill whenever I see it. Anyhow, on watching this one
     day, it struck me that it was a shame nobody knew any longer how to
     operate the AGC—let alone write the programs for it. (As it happens,
     that thought was a bit premature: only 35 years had passed since the
     AGC software was written, thus many of the original software
     developers were still reasonably young. Nevertheless, the principle
     is correct, since very few people could use or program the AGC.)

   It had been a long journey for the AGC from the original mission
   computer in 1970 to the movie release in 1995 to the film inspiring Ron
   Burkey as he viewed it in 2003. Then not long after, Ron began recreate
   a simulation and later a physical version of the AGC.

   Along the way, Ron collected documentation, scanned and transcribed
   code, and built a space for collaboration and dissemination at
   ibiblio/apollo.

   The site and collection greater than a decade in the making recently
   received more attention as the code was placed for download in a github
   repository.

   But to experience the technical complexity and to work on the project
   yourself, you’ll want to visit Ron’s site. You might want to begin with
   the ”Kinder Gentler Introduction” to the AGC unless you know a bit
   about the period and the Apollo already.
