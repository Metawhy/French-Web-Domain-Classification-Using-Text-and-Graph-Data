   and Materials, you acknowledge and agree to abide by the following
   Terms of Use. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Intel
   Web Sites or download any Materials.

Scope of Terms

   These Terms of Use are applicable to all Intel Websites, whether a
   sponsored site, managed through a third party vendor or hosted by a
   third party (referred to hereafter as the "Web Sites"). These Terms
   also apply to any resources and tools provided through Intel Web Sites,
   including but not limited to developer tools, download areas, research
   areas, community forums, chat rooms, blogs, sharing sites and product
   information. These Terms apply to all the Intel Web Sites, both now and
   in the future. Hereafter, all the materials covered by these Terms of
   Use will be referred to as the "Materials."

   Intel may provide activity or program specific Terms of Service, for
   example when Intel provides interactive Materials and/or enables User
   Generated Content. If so, to the extent that these Terms do not
   conflict with the program specific Terms of Service, the Terms herein
   remain in full force and effect.

   the Web Sites or Materials is governed according to Intel's Privacy
   Policy.

   Member Account, Password, and Security: Intel may, from time to time,
   host a program or activity specific site that may require you to
   establish a member account and/or site password. In such cases, you are
   entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
   password and account. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any
   and all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify
   Intel immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other
   breach of security here. Intel will not be liable for any loss that you
   may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account,
   either with or without your knowledge. However, you could be held
   liable for losses incurred by Intel or another party due to someone
   else using your account or password. You may not use anyone else's
   account at any time, without the permission of the account holder.

   Use of Intel Products: Intel products are not intended for use in
   medical, life saving, life sustaining applications. UNLESS OTHERWISE
   AGREED IN WRITING BY INTEL, THE INTEL PRODUCTS ARE NOT DESIGNED NOR
   INTENDED FOR ANY APPLICATION IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE INTEL PRODUCT
   COULD CREATE A SITUATION WHERE PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH MAY OCCUR.

   Changes to Specifications: Intel may make changes to specifications and
   product descriptions at any time, without notice. Designers must not
   rely on the absence or characteristics of any features or instructions
   marked "reserved" or "undefined." Intel reserves these for future
   definition and shall have no responsibility whatsoever for conflicts or
   incompatibilities arising from future changes to them. The product
   information on the Web Site or Materials is subject to change without
   notice. Do not finalize a design with this information.

   Processor Numbers: IntelÂ® processor numbers are not a measure of
   performance. Processor numbers differentiate features within each
   processor family, not across different processor families.

   Defects and Errata: The products described in the Web Site or Materials
   may contain design defects or errors known as errata which may cause
   the product to deviate from published specifications. Current
   characterized errata are available on request. Contact your local Intel
   sales office or your distributor to obtain the latest specifications
   and before placing your product order.

   Benchmarks and Performance Claims: Any performance tests and ratings
   provided in the Web Site are measured using specific computer systems
   and/or components and reflect the approximate performance of Intel
   products as measured by those tests. Any difference in system hardware
   or software design or configuration may affect actual performance.
   Buyers should consult other sources of information to evaluate the
   performance of systems or components they are considering purchasing.
   For more information on performance tests and on the performance of
   Intel products, visit Intel Performance Benchmark Limitations.

   Software and workloads used in performance tests may have been
   optimized for performance only on IntelÂ® microprocessors. Performance
   tests, such as SYSmark* and MobileMark*, are measured using specific
   computer systems, components, software, operations and functions. Any
   change to any of those factors may cause the results to vary. You
   should consult other information and performance tests to assist you in
   fully evaluating your contemplated purchases, including the performance
   of that product when combined with other products.

   Non-Intel Benchmarks: Intel does not control or audit the design or
   implementation of third party benchmarks or Web sites referenced in the
   Materials or on the Web Sites. Intel encourages all of its customers to
   visit the referenced Web sites or others where similar performance
   benchmarks are reported and confirm whether the referenced benchmarks
   are accurate and reflect performance of systems available for purchase.

   Simulated Benchmarks: Results that have been simulated and are provided
   for informational purposes only. Results were derived using simulations
   run on an architecture simulator. Any difference in system hardware or
   software design or configuration may affect actual performance.

Supply Chain Responsibility

$13M in Fees Returned

   To prevent forced and bonded labor in our supply chain, we set
   expectations with our suppliers that workers should not have to pay for
