Sew a Halloween Softie - Frankenstein's Friendly Monster

   Oh. My. Gawd.
   It's been over a year and a half since I last shared a blog post, and
   that was a 'Sew a Softie' tutorial.
   Life has kinda taken over.
   What's happened?
   Well in the last year and a half we have moved countries! We were in
   the UK and now we're in Ireland... not very far away, but still and
   all...!
   So anyway, on with the business at hand... sewing your own Friendly
   Frankenstein's Monster - we'll call him Fred, Fred the Friendly
   Frankensteiny!
   [freddy%2Bthe%2Bfriendly%2Bfrankensteiny%2Bsoftie%2Btutorial%2Bby%2Bgra
   ce%2527s%2Bfavours.jpg]

You Will Need:

   Felt in mint green, brown and white
   1 pipe cleaner
   Toy stuffing
   Thread in black, white, mint green, grey and brown
   Pattern (at the end of this tutorial)

Steps:

   [freddy%2Bthe%2Bfriendly%2Bfrankensteiny%2Bsoftie%2Btutorial%2B1.jpg]
   1. Using 2 strands of brown thread, stitch on the brown hair piece to
   one of the green face pieces.
   2. Using 1 strand of white thread, stitch the white eyes to the felt,
   leaving enough room for the eyebrow(s)!
   3. Using 2 strands of black thread, stitch on the eyeballs, which is
   easiest if you outline the eyeballs first.
   4. Then go back and fill them in with your black thread, keep going
   over the white parts until completely filled in with the black thread.
   [freddy%2Bthe%2Bfriendly%2Bfrankensteiny%2Bsoftie%2Btutorial%2B2.jpg]
   5. Stitch on the details, starting with the eyebrows (monobrow!) and
   then the nose and mouth using 2 strands of black thread. And then using
   2 strands of the grey thread stitch on a scar or two, wherever you
   like. If you struggle to stitch on the details freehand, you can draw
   the details on first with a pencil or with an air drying pen.
   6. Then bend your pipe cleaner into the bolt shape. Try and keep the
   ends of the pipe cleaner in the middle of your bolt piece, so that they
   are hidden inside the head once you stuff it. Then using your green
   thread stitch the bolt into place on the back head piece, or if you
   don't want to see the stitches you can glue the pipe cleaner in place.
   7. Start stitching the front and back head pieces together at the pipe
   cleaner, using 2 strands of green thread. Work around the bottom of the
   head and up to the hairline.
   8. Stitch around the hair piece, using 2 strands of brown thread,
   through all 3 layers of felt. Once you get back to the green felt,
   stuff the softie with the toy stuffing and then stitch up the gap using
   green thread.
   And then you have a Friendly Frankensteiny Softie!

Sew A Softie Tutorial for Valentine's Day - Puppy Love

   Things are moving a darn sight too quickly for me this year... today
   marks the 2 month count down to our moving date! I have so much to do,
   but I couldn't miss out on taking part in the Sew A Softie Tutorials
   round up for Valentine's Day. (Catch up with our other tutorials here)
   I've always struggled to come up with handmade Valentine's
   gifts/creations, but this one came to me while I was walking the dog,
   so I've entitled it 'Puppy Love'
   [puppy%2Blove%2Bsew%2Ba%2Bsoftie%2Btutorial%2Bby%2Bgrace%2527s%2Bfavour
   s.jpg]

You will need:

   2 pieces of red felt 10cm x 10cm
   1 piece of pale pink felt 10cm x 10cm
   1 piece of pink felt 10cm x 10cm
   Scraps of black & white felt
   Pink embroidery thread
   Black embroidery thread
   Red embroidery thread
   Glue
   A good handful of stuffing
   Tweezers

Instructions:

   [puppy%2Blove%2Bsew%2Ba%2Bsoftie%2Btutorial%2Bby%2Bgrace%2527s%2Bfavour
   s%2B1.jpg]
   1. Use all the pattern pieces to cut out 2 red felt hearts, 2 pale pink
   ears, 2 pink ears, 2 white eye pieces, 2 black eye pieces and 1 black
   nose piece. Take 1 pale pink ear and 1 pink ear and whip stitch them
   together. Do the same with the other ear - I reversed the colours, so
   the ears were not the same both sides, but you don't have to.
   2. Turn the ear inside out - I used a pencil to poke the bottom of the
   ear up inside of itself and then used a pair of tweezers to pull it out
   of the top. If you are getting children to sew this pattern, you can
   skip this step and leave the ears right side out.
   3.  Glue the whites of the eyes onto one of the red hearts.
   4. Glue the black part of the eyes onto the whites. I used the tweezers
   again to get them in the right position. With younger children it might
   be easier to draw the blacks of the eyes on with a felt pen.
   [puppy%2Blove%2Bsew%2Ba%2Bsoftie%2Btutorial%2Bby%2Bgrace%2527s%2Bfavour
   s%2B2.jpg]
   5. Glue on the black nose and using a pencil or pen, draw on the mouth.
   6. Using your black thread, back stitch the mouth onto the face.
   7. Pin both red hearts together with the ears sandwiched in between.
   Then using the red thread, back stitch round, following the picture
   above. Leave an opening for the stuffing.
   8. Stuff the face, making sure it is full, but not over stuffed. Then
   back stitch up the opening and you have a finished Puppy friend!
   [puppy%2Blove%2Bsew%2Ba%2Bsoftie%2Btutorial%2Bby%2Bgrace%2527s%2Bfavour
   s%2B3.jpg]
   I hope you've enjoyed making this along with me and keep a look out for
   the rest of our Sew a Softie Valentine's series.

Happy New Year... Stressful New Year?

   Well, we made it to 2017 - Hurrah!
   Do you have any of the fluffy white stuff where you are? We had the
   lightest smattering last night, which had all the kids very excited on
   the walk to school today, even though there was barely enough for a
   snowball - bless 'em.
   I'm very jealous of one friend, who lives in Oregon, USA where they've
   had 6 days off school already with more to come - I'm sure she's bored
   of it by now, but living in the UK, we very rarely see that much in one
   year, let alone in one go!
   However, I digress. Did you have a good new year? We had a very busy
   holiday season as it's our last in the UK for a while. We're planning a
   big move, not a very far one, but a biggie... we're going to Southern
   Ireland!
   [Wales%2Band%2BIreland%2BTour%2BMap.jpg]
   We're moving from the purple arrow to the blue arrow and that little
   stretch of water causes so many more headaches!!
   With that in mind, I'm trying not to take on too much as I have a whole
   house to pack up and ship overseas... but I have decided to join in
   with the 100 Day Project this year which encourages people to explore
   an idea for 100 days, as a creative exercise.
   I'm going to recreate some of my favourite band logos in felt, ending
   up, I hope with 100 logos, with magnets in the backs which I can
   display on a magnetic notice board.
   Typically the project starts next week, so I'm going to trying not to
   fall too far behind during the move.
   I've not been successfully blogging for a while now, so if you want to
   keep up with what I'm up to, Facebook and Instagram are the best places
   to find me:

Christmas Craft Tutorial - How to Make a Robin Softie

   Gulp. It's been a while.
   I didn't mean to take such a long break from blogging, but as with all
   of us, sometimes life just gets in the way.
   But now, I'm baaaaaaack! (Don't groan - I have exceptionally good
   hearing you know!)
   So, I'm posting this as part of another brainchild by Trixi Symonds of
   Coloured Buttons the fab idea - Sew a Softie for Christmas. There'll be
   a host of wonderful bloggers taking part and I'll have another post
   written up later with all their details.
   The idea is that each tutorial is something that you can make at home,
   preferably simple enough to make with your children.
   Here is my offering - A Christmas Felt Robin Softie:
   [Possee%2BFelt%2BXmas%2BRobin%2BSoftie%2BTutorial%2Bby%2BGrace%2527s%2B
   Favours.jpg]
   I love these little guys and after doing my trial run, I had a go at
   making one with Seren, my 8 year old. She was off sick last week, which
   gave us the ideal time to sit down, without any interruptions and get
   going.
   Seren decided she was fine with everything except the sewing machine as
   it was a bit fiddly. Although that stage could be done by hand, which
   she would have managed fine. (Her's is the one with purple legs on the
   left of the picture above)

You will need:

   1 piece of mid brown felt 20cm x 20cm
   1 piece of dark brown felt 10cm x 10cm
   1 piece of red felt 10cm x 10cm
   1 pipe cleaner (any colour you like)
   2 small black brads
   Toy stuffing
   Thread to match your felt
   Sewing machine (optional)
   Pattern pieces which are at the end of this tutorial

Instructions:

   [1%2BFelt%2BXmas%2BRobin%2BSoftie%2BTutorial%2Bby%2BGrace%2527s%2BFavou
   rs%2B.jpg]
   1. Draw around the large pattern piece onto your mid brown felt with a
   biro (a pencil probably won't show up on the brown felt) You can pin
   the pattern to the felt, but little hands found it hard to keep the
   pattern piece in place as it was too large.
   2. Turn the felt shape you have cut out over, so that any pen lines
   showing will be on the inside of the robin,
   3. Cut out the red breast and stitch it to the brown felt as shown in
   the picture. Use 2 strands of red thread to match your felt and back
   stitch in place.
   4. Cut out the small diamond shape from the dark brown felt. Fold it in
   half and attach just above the red breast with a couple of straight
   stitches at the top of the beak.
   [2%2BFelt%2BXmas%2BRobin%2BSoftie%2BTutorial%2Bby%2BGrace%2527s%2BFavou
   rs.jpg]
   5. Mark with your pen where you want the two eyes to be and then push
   each brad through in turn, opening them carefully at the back, so they
   lay flat against the felt.
   6. Starting with one side of the 'face' part, place the rights sides of
   the felt together and stitch all the way along the curved edge. You can
   either do this on a sewing machine or using back stitch if sewing by
   hand.
   7. Repeat for the other side of the 'face' and along one other curved
   side, leaving one side completely open.
   8. Turn your robin the right side out, stuff him full of toy stuffing
   and then ladder stitch the opening closed. If you aren't sure how to do
   ladder stitch, I have a video tutorial on my You Tube channel.
   [3%2BFelt%2BXmas%2BRobin%2BSoftie%2BTutorial%2Bby%2BGrace%2527s%2BFavou
   rs.jpg]
   9. Time to add the wings. Each wing is 2 layers of dark brown felt,
   whip stitched together and then whip stitched to the sides of the
   robin. I've angled mine in the picture above, but in the first pic, the
   trio of robins, they're all on straight with the wing tips pointing
   down. You can choose whichever feels right to you. Try and line them up
   so they're both at the same height and angle though.
   [Felt%2BXmas%2BRobin%2BSoftie%2BTutorial%2Bby%2BGrace%2527s%2BFavours.j
   pg]
   Lastly you need to add the legs. I've used a single pipe cleaner and
   folded each end into a W shape for the claws at the end of the robins
   legs. I've then just stitched the pipe cleaner in place under the
   robin, so you can swivel his legs to be underneath him, or sticking out
   like mine are so he's sitting down. You'll see from the top pic that
   some of the pipe cleaners are longer than others so some have much
   longer legs - you can always cut down your pipe cleaner if you feel
   it's too long.
   And you've done it - you have made your own Christmas Robin Softie!
   Well done!
   I hope you've enjoyed making yours and I'd love to see any pictures of
   your creations from my patterns.

   Happy Sewing!
   PS. Here are the pattern pieces:

How to Make a Willy Wonka Golden Ticket Costume for World Book Day

   Who loves Charlie & The Chocolate Factory?
   Who knew that this year is the centenary of Road Dahl?
   He was born on September 13 1916 and so to mark his 100th Birthday I've
   created this Charlie & The Chocolate Factory dressing up costume!
   AHA! I hear you exclaim. She promised to show us this back in FEBRUARY
   when the costume was originally made for Patrick (Aged 5) to wear to
   school and it's taken till August to get round to posting it - I know
   and I'm sorry! My bad.
   So here's the finished costume on a VERY excited Patrick:
   [Willy%2BWonka%2BGolden%2BTicket%2BCostume%2BTutorial%2Bby%2BGracesfavo
   urs.blogspot.co.uk.jpg]
   You Will Need:
   Large rectangle of thick felt - size according to the person you are
   making the costume for.
   Large rectangle of gold felt (same size as thick felt)
   Large piece of gold material (at least 2" larger than thick felt)
   Black felt for lettering
   Iron on fusible interfacing (bondaweb or similar)
   4 pieces of elastic for shoulder & waist straps
   muslin cloth or cotton cloth for ironing
   Sewing Machine
   Fabric pen or tailor's chalk
   Lots and lots and lots more pins!
   How To:
   1. Iron the fusible interfacing onto black felt, trace around the
   letters (the wrong way round) and cut out. Then iron the black felt
   letters onto the gold material according to the bondaweb instructions.
   For mine, it's simply, peel off the paper backing and iron on a hot
   setting with steam for 10 - 15 seconds on each piece. Make sure you use
   a cotton muslin or cloth on top of the felt & gold material as you
   don't want to cause iron marks on the shiny material.
   2. If you have a really large piece of gold material then you can cut
   it into a rectangle after the letters are ironed in place. But if you
   have a piece of material already cut to size, make sure you center the
   letters on it. I held the gold material up against Patrick to make sure
   it wasn't too big/too small.
   3. Take a large piece of thick felt and cut it to a rectangle 2 inches
   smaller than the gold material.
   4. Pin the gold material onto the felt rectangle and tuck the excess
   behind the felt. Pin all the way round.
   [1%2BWilly%2BWonka%2BGolden%2BTicket%2BCostume%2BTutorial%2Bby%2BGraces
   favours.blogspot.co.uk.jpg]
   5. Realise that you needed to center your words to the middle of the
   rectangle... unpin and re-position. Then repin! D'oh!
   6. Tack the gold fabric into place using a needle and long stitches.
   You will be removing these tacking stitches later, so make them large
   so they're easier to remove.
   7. Cut a piece of gold felt to the same size and pin this onto the back
   of your gold material & thick felt piece. You now have 3 layers.
   8. Machine stitch the 3 layers together, with the 4 pieces of elastic
   slipped in between the layers - 2 at the shoulders and two for the
   waist. To work out where these should go, hold the 'ticket' up to your
   wearer and mark with a fabric pen or chalk onto the gold felt.
   [2%2BWilly%2BWonka%2BGolden%2BTicket%2BCostume%2BTutorial%2Bby%2BGraces
   favours.blogspot.co.uk.jpg]
   9. Cut another piece of the thick felt and another slightly larger
   piece of the gold felt. Pin the gold felt in place over the thick felt,
   with the edges tucked under at the back. Machine stitch these together.
   10. Finally, line up the front and back piece of the ticket (on against
   your wearer if you have another pair of hands to help you, or you can
   lay them down flat on the table/clean floor!) and pin the 4 pieces of
   elastic into place on the back piece of the ticket. Stitch these on by
   hand, making sure you go over them a couple of times or by machine, but
   the whole costume might be a bit unwieldy by then to manage on the
   machine.
   And Ta-Daaaa! You have a Willy Wonka Golden Ticket Costume and
   hopefully a very happy little (or big!) wearer!
   [3%2BWilly%2BWonka%2BGolden%2BTicket%2BCostume%2BTutorial%2Bby%2BGraces

   I'd love to see any pictures you take from making this costume - or any
   of our other patterns!

How To: Felt Weaving - Rainbow Drinks Coaster Tutorial

   Happy Summer Holidays!
   We're currently enjoying a couple of weeks staying with the
   grandparents in Ireland, so beaches, lots of being spoiled by Nanny and
   board games contests are predicted in our futures!
   While we're here, I wanted to share a tutorial with you for the 'Thank
   You' gifts the kids made for their teachers this year - Rainbow Felt
   Woven Coasters.
   This is a great craft for kids of all ages and abilities as you can
   tailor the challenge to suit their capabilities. As we were short on
   time (having, as always, left the present making till the last week of
   term!) I did most of the [DEL: hard work :DEL]  prep and the kids did
   the assembly.
   [rainbow%2Bfelt%2Bwoven%2Bcoasters%2Bby%2Bgracesfavours.blogspot.co.uk.
   jpg]
   You Will Need:
   A square paper template (about 5" x 5")
   1 piece of felt for the base
   5 strips of coloured felts (about 0.75" wide and twice as long as as
   the square)
   glue
   A heavy book.
   Instructions:
   [1%2Brainbow%2Bfelt%2Bwoven%2Bcoasters%2Bby%2Bgracesfavours.blogspot.co
   .uk.jpg]
   1. Using a sharp pair of scissors, cut 6 straight lines from top to
   bottom in your base piece of felt, starting 0.75" down from the top and
   stopping 0.75" from the bottom. Starting with the red piece (if you are
   using the same colours we did - Red, Orange, Yellow, Green &
   Blue/Purple) weave the red felt strip in and out of the base piece.
   [2%2Brainbow%2Bfelt%2Bwoven%2Bcoasters%2Bby%2Bgracesfavours.blogspot.co
   .uk.jpg]
   2. Continue with each felt strip, alternating under and over so you
   have a chequer board look. Wiggle each strip up tight to the one above
   so that all the strips fit into the base piece. Make sure you have a
   good length overhanging at each end.
   [3%2Brainbow%2Bfelt%2Bwoven%2Bcoasters%2Bby%2Bgracesfavours.blogspot.co
   .uk.jpg]
   3. Trim the ends, so that on both sides the felt strips match up to the
   base piece.
   [4%2Brainbow%2Bfelt%2Bwoven%2Bcoasters%2Bby%2Bgracesfavours.blogspot.co
   .uk.jpg]
   4. Add a dot of glue to the end of each strip to secure the felt in
   place to the base piece. Weigh the coasters down with a heavy book
   while the glue dries. (Preferably leave overnight) As you can see by
   the picture below, we tried to keep the ends in place with clips, but
   it leaves dents in the felt once dried, so the book technique was
   dreamed up after the first two coasters were made.
   [5%2Brainbow%2Bfelt%2Bwoven%2Bcoasters%2Bby%2Bgracesfavours.blogspot.co
   .uk.jpg]
   5. Wander off and leave Mummy to do all the clearing up!!
   Hope you like this one - a great one to try with the kids over the
   holidays and good for stash busting!
   We'd love to see any pictures of things you make from our tutorials, so
   please do send them to us at: simmi@gracesfavours.co.uk

Creating a Mixed Media Collage with a Group

   So a while back a friend of mine, who works for the wonderful charity
   Art Space asked me if I would run some sessions that Art Space hold for
   adults with early onset dementia. The sessions are part of the
   MindSCAPE Project, which is an exciting 4 year Big Lottery funded
   project for the Forest of Dean.
   The project is designed for people living with dementia, their families
   and carers, and has been developed to enable people to reconnect back
   to the landscape, through a regular series of meetings and workshops at
   Bracelands Adventure Centre, near Coleford and throughout the Forest of
   Dean.
   I decided that we would, as a group make a large wall hanging, using
   mixed media (paper, felt, cotton & inks) and a variety of applique
   methods - stamping, gluing and stitching.
   The sessions I ran were held over 6 weeks (one class every other
   Tuesday) and as the theme was nature, I chose to get the group making a
   large flower.
   This was one of my example pieces:
   [2016-06-13%2B18.59.15.jpg]
   Each person (or pair if more assistance was needed) had a petal
   template (which were likened to hot air balloon shapes, so watch out
   for that next time!) and a host of smaller nature inspired templates
   that I'd drawn for them. They then got creative!
   In the first session, most people spend their time going through the
   materials and papers, choosing colours and patterns that they liked,
   cutting out their petal and their smaller images and starting to glue
   them in place:
   [MindSCAPE%2BPhotos.jpg]
   Then the middle and last weeks, at their own pace, each person, or
   couple, got onto the fun part of making their petal really stand out.
   We had some special ink stampers, some googly eyes and 3D bug stickers,
   lots of stitching, especially by the men who'd mostly not done any
   sewing before.
   [MindSCAPE%2BPhotos1.jpg]
   A couple of the chaps didn't have the fine motor skills needed for
   working with the patterned fabrics and chose to do some stamping
   instead to decorate their petals. With some help they both achieved
   some wonderfully creative work:
   [MindSCAPE%2BPhotos2.jpg]
   Ultimately the whole group did such amazing petals and when they were
   all put together, they looked fantastic!
   [2016-07-12%2B12.40.57%2B-%2BCopy.jpg]
   We had more petals than I originally expected, but it didn't matter,
   they all worked so well together. I'm over the moon for the group at
   how great it looks.
   I took it home and stitched down the petals that had so far just been
   glued down. I also wanted to add a date to the piece, so I made a
   yellow centre for the flower and stitched 'MINDSCAPE 2016' on it. To
   give it a bit of a 3D element I also stuffed the center. The last thing
   to do was to add a dowel rod at the top so it can be hung up in it's
   new home at ArtSpace.
   [2016-07-13%2B13.59.22.jpg]
   [2016-07-13%2B13.59.41.jpg]
   The group all said they'd really enjoyed the sessions and as if to
   prove it, they've invited me back to run some wet felting sessions next
   Spring! I can't wait!

Sew A Softie Day Tutorial - How to Start Sewing With Kids

   Welcome to Grace's Favours' Sew a Softie Day Tutorial for 2016!
   If you've stumbled across this post, you may not be aware of the Sew a
   Softie Day movement. There's a wee post about it here but in a
   nutshell, it's the brain child of Trixi Symonds who authors the
   Coloured Buttons blog and she's also the author of the book Sew
   Together, Grow Together.
   Because kids generally love sewing and to stop it from becoming a lost
   art, Trixi decided to create Sew a Softie Day (the inaugural day is
   officially on July 16th 2016) and in the run up, for a host of bloggers
   to post tutorials and inspirational projects to help get people
   started.
   I decided to get my kids involved as they both love sewing, they've
   both grown up seeing me sew almost every day and from a very young age,
   have been shown the basics.
   I asked Seren (7.5 yrs) to draw an outline of her chosen animal (a cat)
   and we decided we could use it for Patrick's (big 5 yrs - that's how he
   puts it as he's almost 6!) dog too.
   Based on what Seren drew, I created a pattern for them, with pointy
   ears for her cat and floppy ears for his dog.
   To make a similar animal you will need:
   - fleece or felt
   - stuffing
   - embroidery thread to mach your material (we used pearl cotton as it's
   not stranded so gets less tangled than the 6 stranded embroidery
   thread)
   - 2 buttons for the eyes
   - black thread for the mouth and nose
   - pins, scissors and a pencil
   How we did it:
   1. The kids pinned their paper pattern pieces to two layers of fleece.
   2. Then they drew around the animal shape (minus the ears) with a
   pencil onto the fleece.
   [Sew%2BA%2BSoftie%2BDay%2B2016%2BTutorial%2BPics.jpg]
   3. Next they pinned around their drawn shape (we pinned on the outside
   of the shape so that they would have a seam allowance and wouldn't cut
   too near to the line they'd drawn)
   4. Then they both cut out their body shapes.
   [Sew%2BA%2BSoftie%2BDay%2B2016%2BTutorial%2BPics1.jpg]
    5. Using 1 strand of pearl embroidery cotton in the same colour as
   their fleece, I showed Seren and Patrick how to do running stitch and
   they stitched round their shape, leaving a gap between the legs of
   their animal for stuffing. Patrick got bored about half way through
   this step and had me take over, but Seren carried on and really enjoyed
   herself. Patrick came back and started each of the next steps, but
   didn't want to finish any of them, which is fine as you need to keep
   children engaged, but if you make them finish it they won't find it
   fun.
   [Sew%2BA%2BSoftie%2BDay%2B2016%2BTutorial%2BPics2.jpg]
   6. Then we carefully clipped nearer to the lines, so that the seams
   weren't too bulky and turned them right side out, through the gap we'd
   left.
   7. We lightly stuffed each limb and firmly stuffed the head. Then I
   drew a line across each limb and showed the kids how to do back stitch.
   Seren and back stitch really hit it off and she was going great with
   it. Patrick had a go and got the feel for it and then wanted to watch
   me sew the rest up.
   [Sew%2BA%2BSoftie%2BDay%2B2016%2BTutorial%2BPics3.jpg]
   8. Then we stuffed the body, not too firmly as we didn't want a fat cat
   or dog and I showed Seren how to do a ladder stitch to close up the
   hole. If you want to see a video of how to ladder stitch, there's one
   on my You Tube channel here.
   9. Then we drew a nose and mouth onto our animals using the pencil and
   with some black thread we stitched these details on.
   10. The kids then had fun rummaging through my extensive button
   collection and chose the buttons they wanted to use for the eyes, which
   I then sewed on for both animals as this was a bit tricky once they
   were sewn up.
   11. The last step, which somehow I didn't get a photo of, was choosing
   the material for the ears (Seren used the same and Patrick used part of
   an old Christmas onsie that didn't fit him anymore!) and we used the
   pattern based on Seren's drawing to cut out 4 ear pieces. We repeated
   the same process as for the body - draw around them, then pin 2 layers
   together, outside your lines so that they didn't cut too close to the
   line. Then we running stitched the ears up, leaving them open at the
   bottom and turned them the right side out and ladder stitched them to
   the top of the head.
   [Sew%2BA%2BSoftie%2BDay%2B2016%2BTutorial%2BPics4.jpg]
   And voila!! We have two very happy children with their handmade cat and
   dog!
   [Sew%2BA%2BSoftie%2BDay%2B2016%2BTutorial%2BPics5.jpg]
   They were so pleased with themselves, especially Seren who did almost
   the entire thing on her own! (Although she did say afterwards that she
   thought her cat looked slightly like a pig!!)
   [Sew%2BA%2BSoftie%2BDay%2B2016%2Bsewing%2Bwith%2Bkids%2Btutorial%2B24.j
   pg]
   I haven't done a pattern as half the fun was getting them to draw the
   animal they wanted.
   The whole process took us about 3 hours from start to finish with a
   break for lunch, so if you were teaching a group it would probably take
   2-3 sessions depending on what age the children were and how long each
   session runs for.
   I loved doing this with my kids... I even managed to control my urge to
   get everything looking perfect... the whole idea is for them to be in
   control - gulp!
   I've loved reading everyone else's posts for Sew a Softie Day and I
   hope you get some inspiration from them.

Creating my First Quiet Book

   You have no idea how excited I am writing this post!
   A while ago a friend asked me if I could make her a couple of quiet
   books. I had to do a bit of research as although I had come across some
   on Pinterest I hadn't really looked into how much work went into them.
   A couple of weeks later and here is my finished Quiet Book! I'm so
   pleased to report that my lovely customer is thrilled with it (almost
   more than the children she teaches, who it was intended for!)
   [Front%2BCover.jpg]
   The first page has shapes, with velcro, for colour association and
   shape matching.
   The second & third pages work together - a washing machine, with a
   velcro door, which has a basket full of washing on top of it. You can
   take the washing out of the basket, put it in the machine and then on
   the third page, peg it out on the line or put it in the basket.
   [Quiet%2BBook%2BNo%2B1%2B%25281%2529.jpg]
   The next page is my favourite - the ladybird, which has a zip pocket,
   containing 6 black spots, which can be poppered onto the ladybird's
   body.
   The next page is Rapunzel's tower and her hair needs plaiting and tying
   up.
   The spotty page has a trainer with laces to be threaded through eyelets
   and then done up in a bow.
   The baby page has a nappy with poppers which can be done up and then
   you can play peek-a-boo with the blankie.
   [Quiet%2BBook%2BNo%2B1%2B%25282%2529.jpg]
   The last page has flowers & hearts Noughts and Crosses which attach
   with velcro.
   [Quiet%2BBook%2BNo%2B1%2B%25283%2529.jpg]
   [Quiet%2BBook%2BBack%2BCover.jpg]
   And because you can't get a proper feel for activity books until you
   see them in action, here's a video I shot of me playing with it!

   I'm now making my second one and I'll be back to share it soon!
   I'm also writing up patterns for each page, which will be available in
   my Etsy shop soon!

Sew A Softie Day is Coming to a Blog Near You!

   Hello, my poor neglected blog!
   I'm sorry for leaving you alone for so long.
   But I'm back with some exciting news.... We're taking part in Sew A
   Softie Day!
   [sew_a_softie_day.jpg]
   Sew A Softie Day is the brainchild of Trixi Symonds of Coloured
   Buttons and is all about celebrating the art of sewing with children
   across the globe. For young sewers (sewists?) the easiest thing to
   start with is a simple 2D softie, like the yellow strechy men I made a
   couple of years ago, you can find the tutorial for them here
   [Plush%2BMan%2BGrace%2527s%2BFavours%2BFelt%2BTutorial.jpg]
   I'm going to be joining in the fun on Monday 11th July with a simple
   pattern which can be a cat or a dog (as my kids couldn't agree on what
   they wanted to make!).
   Here's a list of the amazingly talented bloggers taking part (I'm
   really awed to be included!):
