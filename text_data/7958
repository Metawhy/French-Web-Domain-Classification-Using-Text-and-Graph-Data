Who We Are

What Makes up M·A·C

   M·A·C is the world’s leading professional makeup authority because of
   our unrivalled expertise in makeup ARTISTRY.

   M·A·C celebrates diversity and INDIVIDUALITY – we are for All Ages, All
   Races, All Sexes.

   M·A·C is a proud COMMUNITY of professional makeup artists working
   together to bring our vision to life.

   M·A·C is at the forefront of fashion TRENDSETTING, collaborating with
   leading talents from fashion, art and popular culture. Our Artists
   create trends backstage at fashion weeks around the world.

   M·A·C believes in SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, with initiatives such as VIVA
   GLAM and the M·A·C AIDS Fund at the heart and soul of our unique
   culture

Birth of a Cult:
From Wow to Now!

   All Ages, All Races, All Sexes… A professional makeup brand setting
   trends backstage at fashion weeks around the world. Today, M·A·C means
   so many things to its millions of fans in every corner of the planet,
   but a global beauty phenomenon has to begin somewhere.

   Make-Up Art Cosmetics started life in Toronto, Canada. Makeup artist
   and photographer Frank Toskan and salon owner Frank Angelo became
   frustrated by the lack of makeup that photographed well, so they
   decided to create their own. At first, they made the cosmetics in their
   kitchen and sold them straight from the salon to fellow makeup artists,
   as well as models and photographers. Soon, stylists and fashion editors
   got in on the action. As the magazine credits racked up and
   word-of-mouth popularity grew, the duo launched M·A·C in March 1984
   from a counter in a Toronto department store.

   Their approach was chic utility, with the makeup coming in black pots
   rather than compacts. While other major makeup brands at the time were
   predominantly skincare companies, M·A·C chose instead to establish
   itself as the ultimate colour authority. Professional makeup artists
   manned the counter, an industry first. One of the most popular
   offerings was an intense matte red lipstick, which got a boost with an
   appearance in a photo-shoot of the fast-rising Madonna, later seen
   wearing a M·A·C T-shirt.

   The company took the industry by storm, offering a wide range of
   products that blended street savvy with glamorous style and panache.
   Behind the counter, the M·A·C approach was notably different. Rather
   than driving sales through traditional promotional techniques, M·A·C
   relied on the integrity of its carefully formulated product line.
   Adding to the image was a touch of outrageousness. A company that
   honours individuality and self-expression above all else, it brought a
   brilliant sense of drag and theatre into the sleek M·A·C stores and
   department store counters.

   In 1994, as HIV and AIDS continued to spread across the globe, M·A·C
   made HIV/AIDS organizations the beneficiaries of the company’s
   charitable focus and the M·A·C AIDS Fund was created. To date, the VIVA
   GLAM campaign has raised over $380 million for the fight against
   HIV/AIDS, with spokespeople such as Lady Gaga, Pamela Anderson and
   Nicki Minaj.

   Part of the Estée Lauder Companies since 1994, M·A·C is sold today in
   over 105 countries around the world. It remains committed to developing
   new categories, products and over 50 collections each year, all of
   which continue to serve the demand of consumers and professional makeup
   artists alike.

   Collaborations with adored names from popular culture, art and fashion
   have included such names as Rihanna, Lorde, Proenza Schouler, The Rocky
   Horror Picture Show and Brooke Shields. These continue to enhance
   M·A·C’s relevance and reach to existing fans as well as new ones, while
   our makeup Artists’ rock-steady presence backstage at over 200 fashion
   week shows around the world, working with names from Prabal Gurung to
   Vivienne Westwood, secures the envied status of M·A·C as the world’s
   leading beauty trendsetter.

VIVA GLAM
and the M·A·C AIDS Fund

   “I am the M·A·C Girl!” This provocative slogan announced the first face
   of VIVA GLAM – drag icon RuPaul, resplendent in shiny red leather boots
   and corset. A legendary campaign was born, one that would see many
   different stars and styles over the years, but which would always
   retain at its core that same spirit of irreverence, outrageous style
   and irrepressible love of life.

   Created in 1994, the passionate red VIVA GLAM Lipstick raised money and
   awareness for HIV/AIDS at a time when the pandemic was dramatically
   affecting fashion communities in particular as well as the wider world.
   Then and today, an unprecedented 100% of the purchase price of any VIVA
   GLAM product goes toward the M·A·C AIDS Fund (minus VAT where
   applicable).

   In the two decades that have followed since RuPaul made her billboard
   splash, the galaxy of stars who have fronted the campaign is
   unparalleled, including Lady Gaga, Elton John, Debbie Harry, Boy
   George, Cyndi Lauper, Nicki Minaj, Ricky Martin, Christina Aguilera,
   Dita Von Teese, Shirley Manson, Mary J Blige, Rihanna, Miley Cyrus,
   Ariana Grande and most recently Taraji P. Henson.

   The M·A·C AIDS Fund itself is a pioneer in HIV/AIDS funding, providing
   financial support to organizations working with underserved regions and
   populations. As the largest corporate non-pharmaceutical giver in the
   arena, the M·A·C AIDS Fund is committed to addressing the link between
   poverty and HIV/AIDS by supporting diverse organizations around the
   world that provide a wide range of services to people living with
   HIV/AIDS. To date, the M·A·C AIDS Fund has raised over $400 million
   exclusively through the sale of M·A·C VIVA GLAM Lipstick and Lipglass
   donating 100 percent of the sale price to fight HIV/AIDS.

   Long live VIVA GLAM! We are all the M·A·C Girl!

   notify you of, or automatically reject, cookies. If you reject our
   cookies or opt-out of the use of cookies, you may still use this Site,

   technologies such as cookies, web server logs and web beacons to help
   us analyze how visitors use the site. The information collected through
   these means (including IP address) is disclosed to these service
   providers, who use the information to evaluate use of the website. You

   browsing activities on this site. To exercise your choice with respect
   to their collection of information on this site:

       case-by-case basis.

   We also may contract with third-party advertising networks that collect
   IP addresses and other information through the use of cookies, web
   server logs and web beacons on our websites and emails; on third-party
   websites and emails; and on our advertising placed on third-party
   websites. They use this information to provide advertisements about
   products and services tailored to your interests (including for
   companies not affiliated with us). You may see these advertisements on
   our websites and other websites. This process also helps us manage and
   track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. To learn more about
   these and other advertising networks and their opt-out instructions,
   click here.

   not share your personal information with M·A·C Companies, please do not
   provide it to us. We are unable to offer the benefits of M·A·C India

   information with M·A·C Companies.

   our behalf consistent with this Privacy Policy. Examples include data
   analysis firms, customer support specialists, email vendors, webhosting
   companies and fulfillment companies (e.g., companies that coordinate
   mailings). Such third parties may be provided with access to personal
   information needed to perform their functions but may not use such
   information other than on our behalf and in accordance with this
   Privacy Policy.

   consent to the sharing of your information with a third party such as
   an event or promotion co-sponsor. If you consent, we will share your
   information with such third party and the information you provide may
   be used by such third party for their own purposes and in accordance
   with their own policies.

   Business Transfers

   assets. In such transactions, user information, including personal
   information, generally is one of the transferred business assets, and
