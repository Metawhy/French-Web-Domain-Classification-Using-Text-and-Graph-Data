"Emergency" U.S. Sale to Saudi Arabia and UAE

   UPDATED: On July 29, an effort by the Senate to override President
   Trump's vetoes earned a majority but did not succeed in securing a 2/3
   majority. Votes: SJRes 36 (45-40), SJRes 37 (45-39), SJRes38 (46-41).
   On July 17, the House passed SJ Res 36, 37, 38 (see list), related to
   precision-guided munitions and blocking the issuance of export
   licenses. On July 24, President Trump vetoed the resolutions.
   ​On July 11, the House added the Lieu amendment to the National Defense
   Authorization Act by a 246 to 180 vote, which prohibits funds from
   being used to transfer any defense articles or services to Saudi Arabia
   or the United Arab Emirates under the emergency authority of the Arms
   Export Control Act that circumvents congressional review. On July 12,
   the House passed the full NDAA by a vote of 220 to 197.
   In the Senate votes June 20, SJ Res 36 and SJ Res 38 each passed by a
   vote of 53-45 and the remaining 20 resolutions passed en bloc
   51-45 (see list).
   On May 24, Secretary of State Pompeo confirmed that "I made a
   determination pursuant to section 36 of the Arms Export Control Act and
   directed the Department to complete immediately the formal notification
   of 22 pending arms transfers to Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, and
   Saudi Arabia totaling approximately $8.1 billion to deter Iranian
   aggression and build partner self-defense capacity." On June 5, a
   bipartisan group of Senators announced they would introduce 22
   resolutions to block these sales. On June 12, the House Foreign Affairs
   Committee held a hearing on this issue, as did the Senate Foreign
   Relations Committee on July 10.
   We will be updating this page as this story develops, featuring
   comments by Forum-listed experts.

UK Court Decision

   On June 20, the UK Court of Appeal found that UK decisions to sell arms
   to Saudi Arabia were done improperly, instructing the government to
   review decisions. See also UK response on June 25, indicating the
   government would not grant new licenses as it reviews/implements the
   decision. Statements and analysis from organizations with Forum-listed

U.S. Arms Sales to Taiwan

   administration formally notified Congress of the possible sale of 66
   F-16 fighter aircraft to Taiwan for $8 billion, drawing greater
   attention to U.S.-Taiwan arms sales, especially as U.S.-China trade

   On July 11, the House added an amendment (#10) to the NDAA, which would
   block these changes, by a vote of 225 to 205. On July 12, the House
   passed the full NDAA by a vote of 220 to 197.
   On February 4, 2019, Congress was notified of final rules to transfer
   of some items on US Munitions List (USML) categories I-III to the
   Commerce Control List (CCL), starting a 30-day review period.
   Legislation to block the change has now been introduced in both the
   Senate and the House and a hold placed delaying its implementation.
   A hearing on this topic is was held Tuesday, March 26, in the House
   Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. On May
   14, more than 100 organizations sent a letter to Congress opposing the
   changes.
   ​The proposed rule was published on May 24 and closed for public
   comment on July 9, 2018. See resource for concerns expressed and more

Court Action to Implement the Arms Trade Treaty

   12/19/2016

   1 Comment

   This is the fifth blog post in a series looking at an array of issues
   in 2017 related to weapons use, the arms trade and security assistance,
   at times offering recommendations.
   Picture
   Roy Isbister
   In the United Kingdom (UK), a major feature of the first quarter of
   2017 will be the High Court hearing at the start of February on the
   legality or otherwise of continued UK arms sales to Saudi Arabia in the
   light of Saudi violations of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) in
   Yemen. In June 2016, The Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT) was
   granted permission to seek judicial review of the UK government’s arms
   export licensing decisions with regard to Saudi Arabia. In the past 18
   months, the UK has licensed more than £3.3 billion of arms exports to
   Saudi Arabia, a significant proportion of which has comprised Paveway
   IV bombs and Typhoon combat aircraft for use by the Royal Saudi Air
   Force (RSAF).
   This comes against the background of intense conflict in Yemen. A
   10-State Saudi-led coalition began its military intervention in Yemen
   in March 2015, after Houthi rebels, in alliance with former President
   Ali Abdullah Saleh, took control of the capital Sana’a and ousted
   current President Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi. The Houthi-Saleh alliance
   swept south to take control of key cities including Aden. The country
   was quickly engulfed by violence, marking the end of a fragile
   political transition process.
   From very early on in the Saudi-led bombing campaign, regular reports
   began to emerge of airstrikes on critical civilian objects, residential
   areas, and large gatherings of civilians, including Mazraq IDP camp,
   and relief supplies warehouses, attacks on the Old City of Sana’a.
   These regular attacks against civilians and civilian objects, along
   with the use of cluster munitions (which the UK Government may be on
   the verge of acknowledging for the first time), the designation of
   entire cities as military targets, and other practices collectively
   demonstrated a pattern of violations of IHL. The Houthis have also
   committed apparent IHL abuses, firing artillery and missiles at
   civilian areas in Saudi Arabia and in Yemen. All other parties to the
   conflict appear to have similarly committed violations of IHL.
   On the basis of the scale of problems related to bombings in Yemen, in
   December 2015, Saferworld, with Amnesty International and Oxfam, sought
   a legal opinion from Matrix Chambers. The opinion found that the UK
   government had “misdirected itself in law” on continued arms sales to
   Saudi Arabia.  Citing Article 6.3 of the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT),
   Matrix concluded the Government had knowledge that its arms would be
   used to breach IHL, and that therefore such sales were prohibited.
   Matrix further concluded, having examined a series of potential
   breaches of IHL by the RSAF, that even if the “knowledge test” for
   prohibiting sales under Article 6.3 was not met, the standard of
   “overriding risk” that UK arms would be used to commit serious
   violations of IHL had been met, and any reasonable risk assessment
   would conclude that sales to Saudi Arabia of any controlled equipment
   at risk of being used in the conflict in Yemen should be stopped.
   When CAAT moved for judicial review, the Government sought to quash the
   hearing on the grounds that it had access to information not available
   to the UN or the public that explained Saudi actions as consistent with
   IHL. However the judge, in insisting that were grounds for judicial
   review and that the hearing should be expedited, said there was
   abundant evidence of breaches of IHL that the government had to take
   into account. He was particularly referring to UN reports citing many
   IHL violations.
   The case will be extremely important. The UK Government has pursued an
   extremely narrow consideration of IHL in performing risk assessments
   for arms export licensing. Lawyers have advised that this is in line
   with a near twenty-year attempt by the UK and other Western governments
   to narrow the scope of IHL, rowing back on seventy years of
   international jurisprudence. Recognizing the importance of this case
   for all their years of campaigning work, Amnesty International and
   Human Rights Watch will also be presenting arguments. All feel they can
   raise issues that the court needs to consider that make CAAT’s success
   more likely.
   A defeat for the Government will clarify that the risk to IHL of arms
   transfers cannot be set aside due to other considerations, and will
   potentially help give meaning to the relevant articles of the ATT.
   This may also have particular implications for other EU member states,
   as UK law is in addition subject to shared obligations under an EU
   instrument (the Common Position).
   The recent US decision to stop the supply of precision-guided weapons
   to the RSAF and to limit certain intelligence-sharing due to systematic
   and endemic failures in targeting will be a considerable boost to CAAT.
    Under the US system, the President can send a ”signal” to the Saudi
   Government by refusing certain arms sales at the same time as
   continuing to support the Saudi air campaign by other means (e.g. by
   refuelling Saudi aircraft).  However the UK does not have this option.
   For the UK, national law, the EU Common Position and the ATT all agree
   that whenever there is a clear risk that the arms in question might be
   used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international
   humanitarian or human rights law, a proposed transfer must be refused.
   So if there are “systemic, endemic” problems with Saudi targeting in
   Yemen, all transfers of arms from the UK that might be used by the RSAF
   will have to be stopped.  Parliament is already asking why the UK is
   ignoring what the Obama administration has determined.  The court will
   undoubtedly ask those questions too. Hopefully, 2017 will begin with a
   UK High Court ruling that substantially strengthens the ATT.

   The court has taken this action on the trade of arms on account of
   various circumstances. I have read the whole blog and I have inferred
   the fact that this act is very justified in itself and should be
   necessarily implemented and followed.
