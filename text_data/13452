Sigfox, a 0G Network

Connecting Your Physical World

     * Picto advantage 1

Low Energy Consumption
       Our unique connectivity solution provides the lowest
       energy-consumption device-to-cloud. By simplifying communications,
       we enable unbeatable low energy consumption. Soon, there'll be no
       need for replacing or re-charging batteries since the devices will
       generate energy themselves.

Low cost
       With its simple approach to connectivity, Sigfox provides extremely
       price-competitive connectivity subscriptions and even more
       importantly, enables extremely simple and cost-efficient silicon
       modules.

       combining other connectivity solutions with Sigfox, business cases
       and user experience can be drastically improved.
