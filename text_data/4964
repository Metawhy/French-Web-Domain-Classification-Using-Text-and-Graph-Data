   “I am a girl of now”, those were the words spoken by 5 girls (including
   myself) in this video shot a couple of months ago in multicultural
   London.

   Video-Player

   My personal thoughts about whats behind the  “Girl of Now” (shop here)
   and a travel diary about my time with Elie Saab discovering the said
   fragrance during Paris Couture fashion week you can read in the
   following blogpost. Hope you enjoy it!

   Lets begin with the facts…
   Fashion has always been a medium where creative expression and taste
   are harmonised into a physical representation of identity. It has
   played such an important part in my life, especially in discovering who
   I am and who I want to be. Being able to express my identity in so many
   different ways is why fashion brings out my innermost confidence. This
   is also why I would wear Elie Saab’s perfume – in order to be more
   confident in my own skin. But what does it truly mean to be a “Girl of
   Now” (shop here)?

   Being a “Girl of Now” (shop here) means being spontaneous, not caring
   too much what other people would think about you. Living life without
   the restrictions of modern society. A contemporary girl that can dream
   big and isn’t afraid of setting goals for herself.
     * A girl who is comfortable with the decisions she makes. But also
       learns from mistakes and try to get a better version of herself
       every day.
     * A girl who is fun, radiant and oozes positive energy. Someone who
       can let go and have a good time when needed.  It also means living
       in the present. Seizing the moment before it might be too late.
     * A girl that enjoys the little things in life. Somebody that
       appreciates what’s in front of you.

   As I said in the video I take my life very seriously, being a
   professional at work is essential- however, I do not take myself too
   seriously.

   I really feel connected to the perfume. But not only because of the
   idea behind it. I also like the scent of the fragrance as its subtle,
   direct and uncompromising. It is floral and oriental, including an
   orange blossom accord. I was one of the first ones to smell it at the
   presentation in Paris about one month ago. After discovering the
   fragrance, I had the honor to go to the magical Elie Saab haute couture
   show in the afternoon and the fun afterparty at night. Everything
   harmonized perfectly with each other. I had an amazing time! In the
   following pictures I share these memories with you…
