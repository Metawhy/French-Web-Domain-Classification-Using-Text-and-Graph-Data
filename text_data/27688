   Notice: GNUnet is still undergoing major development. It is largely not
   yet ready for usage beyond developers

                                   GNUnet

   GNUnet is a new network protocol stack for building secure,
   distributed, and privacy-preserving applications. With strong roots in
   academic research, our goal is to replace the old insecure Internet
   protocol stack.
   GNUnet is typically run as an overlay network on top of the existing
   Internet infrastructure forming the basis of a hybrid peer-to-peer mesh
   and relay backbone for applications to run on. It could just as well be
   run independently of the Internet, over dedicated radio and cable.
   GNUnet is made for a free and open society: It's a self-organizing
   network and it is free software as in freedom. GNUnet puts you in
   control of your data. You determine which data to share with whom, and
   you're not pressured to accept compromises.

   About   Install   Engage

The Internet of tomorrow needs GNUnet today

Imagine...

   The conventional Internet is currently like a system of roads with deep
   potholes and highwaymen all over the place. Even if you still can use
   the roads (e.g. send emails, or browse websites) your vehicle might get
   hijacked, damaged, or long arms might reach into its back and steal
   your items (data) to use it against you and sell it to others - while
   you can't even notice the thievery nor accuse and hold the scroungers
   accountable.

The Internet is broken

   Protocols from Ethernet and IP to BGP and X.509 PKI are insecure by
   default: protecting against address forgery, routers learning metadata,
   or choosing trustworthy CAs is nontrivial and sometimes impossible.

   GNUnet provides privacy by design, improving addressing, routing,
   naming and content distribution in a technically robust manner - as
   opposed to ad-hoc designs in place today.

Decentralization is hard

   Instead of sharing common components and tools for building P2P
   systems, every P2P project seems to re-invent the wheel. This heightens
   the effort and increases the potential number of vulnerabilities.

   GNUnet is a metadata-preserving foundation for your application,
   covering areas from addressing to reliable bidirectional
   Axolotl-encrypted channels, with advanced routing. Our work is based on
   continuous research spanning almost two decades.

Metadata is exposed

   Your metadata is just as revealing as the actual content; and it gets
   exposed on the Internet.
   Even though transport encryption is increasingly being deployed on the
   Internet, it still reveals data that can threaten democracy: the
   identities of senders and receivers, the times, frequency and the
   volume of communication are all still revealed.
   GNUnet addresses these concerns with perfect forward secrecy via
   ephemeral public key addressing, fixed packet size to hinder traffic
   analysis, layered encryption, Sybil-resistant routing, and more.

Freedoms are not respected

   Today, monitoring increasingly centralized infrastructure, proprietary
   implementations, traffic shapers and firewalls restrict all of the
   essential freedoms to various degrees.

   GNUnet gives users freedoms to securely access information ("run" the
   network), to study all aspects of the network's operation ("access the
   code"), to distribute information ("copy"), as well as the freedom to
   deploy new applications ("modify").

Learn more about GNUnet

   If you want to know more about the GNUnet please continue reading the
   about page. There are much more resources, such as the main handbook /
   reference manual, a bibliography and videos.

   You are very welcome to get engaged into the conversation, install
   GNUnet, use it and contribute.
   Be aware that this project is still in an early alpha stage when it
   comes to software – its not an easy task to rewrite the whole Internet!

Featured Applications

GNU Taler (Alpha)

   GNU Taler is a new privacy-preserving electronic payment system.
   Payments are cryptographically secured and are confirmed within
   milliseconds with extremely low transaction costs.

The GNU Name System

   The GNU Name System (GNS) is a fully decentralized replacement for the
   Domain Name System (DNS). Instead of using a hierarchy, GNS uses a
   directed graph. Naming conventions are similar to DNS, but queries and
   replies are private even with respect to peers providing the answers.
   The integrity of records and privacy of look-ups is cryptographically
   secured.

re:claimID

   re:claimID is a decentralized Identity Provider (IdP) service built in
   top of the GNU Name System. It allows users to securely share personal
   information with websites using standardized protocols (OpenID
   Connect).

Filesharing (Alpha)

   GNUnet filesharing is an application that aims to provide
   censorship-resistant, anonymous filesharing. The publisher is empowered
   to make a gradual choice between performance and anonymity.

Conversation (Pre-Alpha)

   GNUnet conversation is an application that provides secure voice
   communication in a fully decentralized way by employing GNUnet for
   routing and transport.

Upcoming Applications

secushare

   secushare is creating a decentralized social networking application on
   top of GNUnet. Using overlay multicast and the extensible PSYC
   protocol, notifications are distributed end-to-end encrypted to
   authorized recipients only.

pretty Easy privacy

   pretty Easy privacy (p≡p) is creating a usable end-to-end encrypted
   e-mail solution using opportunistic key exchange. p≡p will use GNUnet
   to protect metadata and exploit new cryptographic protocols to verify
   keys.

2019-07-24: GNUnet 0.11.6 released

   We are pleased to announce the release of GNUnet 0.11.6.

   This is a bugfix release for 0.11.5, fixing a lot of minor bugs,
   improving stability and code quality. Further, our videos are back on
   the homepage. In this release, we again improved the webpage in general
   and updated our documentation. As always: In terms of usability, users
   should be aware that there are still a large number of known open
   issues in particular with respect to ease of use, but also some
   critical privacy issues especially for mobile users. Also, the nascent
   network is tiny (about 200 peers) and thus unlikely to provide good
   anonymity or extensive amounts of interesting information. As a result,
   the 0.11.6 release is still only suitable for early adopters with some
   reasonable pain tolerance.

     * http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gnunet/gnunet-fuse-0.11.0.tar.gz.sig

   gnunet-fuse was not released again, as there were no changes and the
   0.11.0 versions are expected to continue to work fine with
   gnunet-0.11.6.

   Note that due to mirror synchronization, not all links might be
   functional early after the release. For direct access try
   http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnunet/

Noteworthy changes in 0.11.6 (since 0.11.5)

     * gnunet-identity can now print private keys.
     * The REST service can be configured to echo the HTTP Origin header
       value for Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing (CORS) when it is called by
       a browser plugin. Optionally, a CORS Origin to echo can be also be
       directly configured.
     * re:claimID tickets are now re-used whenever possible.
     * SUID binary detection mechanisms implemented to improve
       compatiblity with some distributions.
     * TRANSPORT, TESTBED and CADET tests now pass again on macOS.
     * CADET: Replaced enum GNUNET_CADET_ChannelOption with
       GNUNET_MQ_PriorityPreferences in preparation of API changed in the
       future.
     * The GNS proxy Certification Authority is now generated using
       gnutls-certtool, if available, with opennssl/certtool as fallback.
     * Documentation, comments and code quality was improved.

Known Issues

     * There are known major design issues in the TRANSPORT, ATS and CORE
       subsystems which will need to be addressed in the future to achieve
       acceptable usability, performance and security.
     * There are known moderate implementation limitations in CADET that
       negatively impact performance.
     * There are known moderate design issues in FS that also impact
       usability and performance.
     * There are minor implementation limitations in SET that create
       unnecessary attack surface for availability.
     * The RPS subsystem remains experimental.
     * Some high-level tests in the test-suite fail non-deterministically
       due to the low-level TRANSPORT issues.

   In addition to this list, you may also want to consult our bug tracker
   at bugs.gnunet.org which lists about 190 more specific issues.

2019-06-28: Peer DSTJ is dead, long live peer Y924

   After some issues with our infrastructure we needed to replace our
   bootstrapping peer. To avoid problems when connecting to GNUnet the
   operator of a peer needs to update its node by removing the peer ID
   DSTJBRRKZ8TBW3FGK6B0M5QXWT9WYNZ45H5MCV4HY7ST64Q8T9F0 from the system.
   Here are two strategies to find copies of the respective file:

    1. $ locate DSTJBRRKZ8TBW3FGK6B0M5QXWT9WYNZ45H5MCV4HY7ST64Q8T9F0
    2. $ find / -name DSTJBRRKZ8TBW3FGK6B0M5QXWT9WYNZ45H5MCV4HY7ST64Q8T9F0

   Update: DSTJ has now been blacklisted. Please update your GNUnet peer.

2019-06-28: GNUnet Hacker Meeting 2019 at La Décentrale, Switzerland

   The members of the GNUnet community met again in the wonderful
   souroundings of St. Imier to hack on GNUnet. New people joined our
   sessions until late at night. From bug squashing to digging our own dog
   food, from workshops to theoretical discussions of new services and
   usecases. And of course, pizza was in the game.

2019-06-05: GNUnet 0.11.5 released

   We are pleased to announce the release of GNUnet 0.11.5.

   This is a bugfix release for 0.11.4, mostly fixing a few minor bugs and
   improving performance, in particular for identity management with a
   large number of egos. In the wake of this release, we also launched the
   REST API documentation. In terms of usability, users should be aware
   that there are still a large number of known open issues in particular
   with respect to ease of use, but also some critical privacy issues
   especially for mobile users. Also, the nascent network is tiny (about
   200 peers) and thus unlikely to provide good anonymity or extensive
   amounts of interesting information. As a result, the 0.11.5 release is
   still only suitable for early adopters with some reasonable pain
   tolerance.

   gnunet-gtk saw some minor changes to adopt it to API changes in the
   main code related to the identity improvements. gnunet-fuse was not
   released again, as there were no changes and the 0.11.0 version is
   expected to continue to work fine with gnunet-0.11.5.

   Note that due to mirror synchronization, not all links might be

Noteworthy changes in 0.11.5 (since 0.11.4)

     * gnunet-identity is much faster when creating or deleting egos given
       a large number of existing egos.
     * GNS now supports CAA records.
     * Documentation, comments and code quality was improved.

Known Issues

     * There are known major design issues in the TRANSPORT, ATS and CORE
       subsystems which will need to be addressed in the future to achieve
       acceptable usability, performance and security.

2019-02: GNUnet 0.11.0 released

   We are pleased to announce the release of GNUnet 0.11.0.

   This is a major release after about five years of development. In terms
   of usability, users should be aware that there are still a large number
   of known open issues in particular with respect to ease of use, but
   also some critical privacy issues especially for mobile users. Also,
   the nascent network is tiny (about 200 peers) and thus unlikely to
   provide good anonymity or extensive amounts of interesting information.
   As a result, the 0.11.0 release is still only suitable for early
   adopters with some reasonable pain tolerance.

   Note that GNUnet is now started using gnunet-arm -s. GNUnet should be
   stopped using gnunet-arm -e.

Noteworthy changes in 0.11.0

     * The Web site and manuals have undergone significant rework. You can
       find an archive of the old Web site at archive.org.
     * The code now builds again on macOS. GNUnet on macOS is
       experimental. While it builds and seems to run fine, some tests are
       known to fail.
     * Build process now works properly with libidn2
     * Except for gnunet-qr, all Python code was migrated to Python 3.7.
     * Fixed security issues in secret sharing cryptography logic
     * Services running out of file descriptors on accept() no longer busy
       wait
     * Fixed crash in gnunet-gns2dns proxy
     * GNS responses are now padded to minimize information disclosure
       from the size
     * Fixed API issues and (rare) crash bugs in CADET
     * The experimental SecuShare code is not included in the release, you
       can now find it in the gnunet-secushare Git repository.
     * The Ascension tool (separate download) now allows importing DNS
       zones into GNS via AXFR.
     * GNUnet now includes a decentralised identity attribute sharing
       service: reclaimID. A ready-to-use client can be found in an
       external repo.
     * The code now builds again on NetBSD. GNUnet on NetBSD is
       experimental. While it builds and seems to run fine, full support
       requires more changes in the core of GNUnet It will soon be
       available via pkgsrc.
     * Many things changed on the build system side. If you package GNUnet
       for an operating system or otherwise package manager, make sure
       that you read the README.

   The above is just the short list, our bugtracker lists over 100
   individual issues that were resolved since 0.11.0pre66.

Android Port

   It is time for GNUnet to run properly on Android. Note that GNUnet is
   written in C, and this is not about rewriting GNUnet in Java, but about
   getting the C code to run on Android.

Help with Continuous Integration setup

   There is a push for migrating our CI to Gitlab. The CI should
   eventually not just run "make check" on various platforms, but also
   perform tests with multiple peers running in different VMs with
   specific network topologies (i.e. NAT) between them being simulated.
   The CI should also be integrated with Gauger for performance regression
   analysis. Running jobs only when dependencies have changed and
   scripting more granular triggers or ideally automatic dependency
   discovery (as done by the autotools) is also important.
   Mentor: TBD

Migrate gnunet-qr from Python 2.7 to C using libzbar

   Python 2.7 is reaching its end-of-life, and we want to get rid of the
   dependency on Python. The existing gnunet-qr tool is a rather simple
   wrapper around python-zbar, which itself wraps libzbar. The goal of
   this project is to directly use libzbar to scan QR codes for GNUnet /
   the GNU Name System (see also #5562).

re:claimID OpenID Connect performance improvements

   reclaimID is a decentralized identity system build on top of the GNU
   Name System. Upon authorization, the user provides a requesting party
   (RP) such as a website with an authorization ticket (e.g. piggybacked
   in an OpenID authorization code). The RP uses information contained in
   this ticket to
    1. Retrieve the decryption key from GNS
    2. Retrieve the user attributes from GNS

   The GNS lookups ensure that the RP receives up-to-date attributes and
   functional decryption keys. However, in particular the RP-specific
   encryption key resolution can be slow and even fail depending on the
   network topology. We propose that in an initial exchange, in particular
   OpenID authorization code flows, we try to incorporate key and maybe
   even an attribute set in the ticket exchange. In order to mitigate this
   issue, this project is meant to investigate and implement how...
    1. ... decryption keys can be added to an initial exchange in OpenID.
    2. ... initial set(s) of attributes can be piggybacked in OpenID.

   Mentor: Martin Schanzenbach

re:claimID alternative GNS-based encryption

   re:claimID is a decentralized identity system build on top of the GNU
   Name System. The initial design and implementation of re:claimID
   includes an attribute-based encryption module in order to prevent
   unauthorized access to attributes in the name system. Our motivation
   for re:claimID was for it to be name system agnostic, which means the
   design theoretically also works for other name systems such as
   namecoin. Other name systems often do not have built-in mechanisms in
   order to do this. Hence, we implemented an ABE access control layer.
   Our ABE implementation requires two third party libraries: libpbc and
   libgabe. While we could merge libgabe into the gnunet service
   implementation of re:claimID, libpbc is a rather large, third party
   library which lacks packaging in distributions and for platforms. On
   the other hand, GNS supports record data encryption using symmetric
   keys as labels. If we make the access control layer of re:claimID more
   generic in order to support both ABE and GNS encryption, we could
   reduce the required depenencies. This would result in gnunet packages
   to include re:claimID by default. In short, the goals are to...
    1. ... improve performance by reducing encryption overhead.
    2. ... reduce dependencies.

Enable all networking applications to run over GNUnet out of the box

   One great problem of the current Internet is the lack of
   disintermediation. When people want to talk they need a chat service.
   When they want to share files they need a file transfer service.
   Although GNUnet already possesses quite advanced integration into Linux
   networking, a little extra work is needed for existing applications
   like irc, www, ftp, rsh, nntpd to run over it in a peer-to-peer way,
   simply by using a GNS hostname like friend.gnu. Once people have added
   a person to their GNS they can immediately message, exchange files and
   suchlike directly, with nothing but the GNUnet in the middle, using
   applications that have been distributed with unix systems ever since
   the 1980's. We can produce an OS distribution where these things work
   out of the box with the nicknames of people instead of cloud services.
   For more information and context, read bug id 4625.

   Notice: GNUnet is still undergoing major development. It is largely not
   yet ready for usage beyond developers

                                   GNUnet

   GNUnet is a new network protocol stack for building secure,
   distributed, and privacy-preserving applications. With strong roots in
   academic research, our goal is to replace the old insecure Internet
   protocol stack.
   GNUnet is typically run as an overlay network on top of the existing
   Internet infrastructure forming the basis of a hybrid peer-to-peer mesh
   and relay backbone for applications to run on. It could just as well be
   run independently of the Internet, over dedicated radio and cable.
   GNUnet is made for a free and open society: It's a self-organizing
   network and it is free software as in freedom. GNUnet puts you in
   control of your data. You determine which data to share with whom, and
   you're not pressured to accept compromises.

   About   Install   Engage

The Internet of tomorrow needs GNUnet today

Imagine...

   The conventional Internet is currently like a system of roads with deep
   potholes and highwaymen all over the place. Even if you still can use
   the roads (e.g. send emails, or browse websites) your vehicle might get
   hijacked, damaged, or long arms might reach into its back and steal
   your items (data) to use it against you and sell it to others - while
   you can't even notice the thievery nor accuse and hold the scroungers
   accountable.

The Internet is broken

   Protocols from Ethernet and IP to BGP and X.509 PKI are insecure by
   default: protecting against address forgery, routers learning metadata,
   or choosing trustworthy CAs is nontrivial and sometimes impossible.

   GNUnet provides privacy by design, improving addressing, routing,
   naming and content distribution in a technically robust manner - as
   opposed to ad-hoc designs in place today.

Decentralization is hard

   Instead of sharing common components and tools for building P2P
   systems, every P2P project seems to re-invent the wheel. This heightens
   the effort and increases the potential number of vulnerabilities.

   GNUnet is a metadata-preserving foundation for your application,
   covering areas from addressing to reliable bidirectional
   Axolotl-encrypted channels, with advanced routing. Our work is based on
   continuous research spanning almost two decades.

Metadata is exposed

   Your metadata is just as revealing as the actual content; and it gets
   exposed on the Internet.
   Even though transport encryption is increasingly being deployed on the
   Internet, it still reveals data that can threaten democracy: the
   identities of senders and receivers, the times, frequency and the
   volume of communication are all still revealed.
   GNUnet addresses these concerns with perfect forward secrecy via
   ephemeral public key addressing, fixed packet size to hinder traffic
   analysis, layered encryption, Sybil-resistant routing, and more.

Freedoms are not respected

   Today, monitoring increasingly centralized infrastructure, proprietary
   implementations, traffic shapers and firewalls restrict all of the
   essential freedoms to various degrees.

   GNUnet gives users freedoms to securely access information ("run" the
   network), to study all aspects of the network's operation ("access the
   code"), to distribute information ("copy"), as well as the freedom to
   deploy new applications ("modify").

Learn more about GNUnet

   If you want to know more about the GNUnet please continue reading the
   about page. There are much more resources, such as the main handbook /
   reference manual, a bibliography and videos.

   You are very welcome to get engaged into the conversation, install
   GNUnet, use it and contribute.
   Be aware that this project is still in an early alpha stage when it
   comes to software – its not an easy task to rewrite the whole Internet!

Featured Applications

GNU Taler (Alpha)

   GNU Taler is a new privacy-preserving electronic payment system.
   Payments are cryptographically secured and are confirmed within
   milliseconds with extremely low transaction costs.

The GNU Name System

   The GNU Name System (GNS) is a fully decentralized replacement for the
   Domain Name System (DNS). Instead of using a hierarchy, GNS uses a
   directed graph. Naming conventions are similar to DNS, but queries and
   replies are private even with respect to peers providing the answers.
   The integrity of records and privacy of look-ups is cryptographically
   secured.

re:claimID

   re:claimID is a decentralized Identity Provider (IdP) service built in
   top of the GNU Name System. It allows users to securely share personal
   information with websites using standardized protocols (OpenID
   Connect).

Filesharing (Alpha)

   GNUnet filesharing is an application that aims to provide
   censorship-resistant, anonymous filesharing. The publisher is empowered
   to make a gradual choice between performance and anonymity.

Conversation (Pre-Alpha)

   GNUnet conversation is an application that provides secure voice
   communication in a fully decentralized way by employing GNUnet for
   routing and transport.

Upcoming Applications

secushare

   secushare is creating a decentralized social networking application on
   top of GNUnet. Using overlay multicast and the extensible PSYC
   protocol, notifications are distributed end-to-end encrypted to
   authorized recipients only.

pretty Easy privacy

   pretty Easy privacy (p≡p) is creating a usable end-to-end encrypted
   e-mail solution using opportunistic key exchange. p≡p will use GNUnet
   to protect metadata and exploit new cryptographic protocols to verify
   keys.

2019-07-24: GNUnet 0.11.6 released

   We are pleased to announce the release of GNUnet 0.11.6.

   This is a bugfix release for 0.11.5, fixing a lot of minor bugs,
   improving stability and code quality. Further, our videos are back on
   the homepage. In this release, we again improved the webpage in general
   and updated our documentation. As always: In terms of usability, users
   should be aware that there are still a large number of known open
   issues in particular with respect to ease of use, but also some
   critical privacy issues especially for mobile users. Also, the nascent
   network is tiny (about 200 peers) and thus unlikely to provide good
   anonymity or extensive amounts of interesting information. As a result,
   the 0.11.6 release is still only suitable for early adopters with some
   reasonable pain tolerance.

   gnunet-fuse was not released again, as there were no changes and the
   0.11.0 versions are expected to continue to work fine with
   gnunet-0.11.6.

   Note that due to mirror synchronization, not all links might be
   functional early after the release. For direct access try

Noteworthy changes in 0.11.6 (since 0.11.5)

     * gnunet-identity can now print private keys.
     * The REST service can be configured to echo the HTTP Origin header
       value for Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing (CORS) when it is called by
       a browser plugin. Optionally, a CORS Origin to echo can be also be
       directly configured.
     * re:claimID tickets are now re-used whenever possible.
     * SUID binary detection mechanisms implemented to improve
       compatiblity with some distributions.
     * TRANSPORT, TESTBED and CADET tests now pass again on macOS.
     * CADET: Replaced enum GNUNET_CADET_ChannelOption with
       GNUNET_MQ_PriorityPreferences in preparation of API changed in the
       future.
     * The GNS proxy Certification Authority is now generated using
       gnutls-certtool, if available, with opennssl/certtool as fallback.
     * Documentation, comments and code quality was improved.

Known Issues

     * There are known major design issues in the TRANSPORT, ATS and CORE
       subsystems which will need to be addressed in the future to achieve
       acceptable usability, performance and security.
     * There are known moderate implementation limitations in CADET that

     * There are known moderate design issues in FS that also impact
       usability and performance.
     * There are minor implementation limitations in SET that create
       unnecessary attack surface for availability.
     * The RPS subsystem remains experimental.
     * Some high-level tests in the test-suite fail non-deterministically
       due to the low-level TRANSPORT issues.

2019-06-28: Peer DSTJ is dead, long live peer Y924

   After some issues with our infrastructure we needed to replace our
   bootstrapping peer. To avoid problems when connecting to GNUnet the
   operator of a peer needs to update its node by removing the peer ID
   DSTJBRRKZ8TBW3FGK6B0M5QXWT9WYNZ45H5MCV4HY7ST64Q8T9F0 from the system.
   Here are two strategies to find copies of the respective file:

    1. $ locate DSTJBRRKZ8TBW3FGK6B0M5QXWT9WYNZ45H5MCV4HY7ST64Q8T9F0
    2. $ find / -name DSTJBRRKZ8TBW3FGK6B0M5QXWT9WYNZ45H5MCV4HY7ST64Q8T9F0

   Update: DSTJ has now been blacklisted. Please update your GNUnet peer.

   sessions until late at night. From bug squashing to digging our own dog
   food, from workshops to theoretical discussions of new services and
   usecases. And of course, pizza was in the game.

2019-06-05: GNUnet 0.11.5 released

   We are pleased to announce the release of GNUnet 0.11.5.

   This is a bugfix release for 0.11.4, mostly fixing a few minor bugs and
   improving performance, in particular for identity management with a
   large number of egos. In the wake of this release, we also launched the
   REST API documentation. In terms of usability, users should be aware
   that there are still a large number of known open issues in particular
   with respect to ease of use, but also some critical privacy issues
   especially for mobile users. Also, the nascent network is tiny (about

Noteworthy changes in 0.11.5 (since 0.11.4)

     * gnunet-identity is much faster when creating or deleting egos given
       a large number of existing egos.
     * GNS now supports CAA records.
     * Documentation, comments and code quality was improved.

Known Issues

     * There are known major design issues in the TRANSPORT, ATS and CORE

Noteworthy changes in 0.11.4 (since 0.11.3)

     * gnunet-arm -s no longer logs into the console by default and
       instead into a logfile (in $GNUNET_HOME).
     * The reclaim subsystem is no longer experimental. See also
       re:claimID. Further, the internal encryption scheme moved from ABE
       to GNS-style encryption.
     * GNUnet now depends on a more recent version of libmicrohttpd.
     * The REST API now includes read-only access to the configuration.
     * All manpages are now in mdoc format.
     * gnunet-download-manager.scm removed.

Known Issues

     * There are known major design issues in the TRANSPORT, ATS and CORE
       subsystems which will need to be addressed in the future to achieve
       acceptable usability, performance and security.
     * There are known moderate implementation limitations in CADET that
       negatively impact performance. Also CADET may unexpectedly deliver
       messages out-of-order.
     * There are known moderate design issues in FS that also impact
       usability and performance.
     * There are minor implementation limitations in SET that create
       unnecessary attack surface for availability.
     * The RPS subsystem remains experimental.
     * Some high-level tests in the test-suite fail non-deterministically
       due to the low-level TRANSPORT issues.

2019-04-07: GNUnet 0.11.3 released

   We are pleased to announce the release of GNUnet 0.11.3.

   This is a bugfix release for 0.11.2, mostly fixing a few build issues.
   In terms of usability, users should be aware that there are still a
   large number of known open issues in particular with respect to ease of
   use, but also some critical privacy issues especially for mobile users.
   Also, the nascent network is tiny (about 200 peers) and thus unlikely
   to provide good anonymity or extensive amounts of interesting
   information. As a result, the 0.11.3 release is still only suitable for
   early adopters with some reasonable pain tolerance.

Noteworthy changes in 0.11.3 (since 0.11.2)

     * gnunet-zoneimport now handles -h correctly
     * iptables and other similar binaries are no longer hard-coded but
       detected at configure time (with hard-coded fallback locations).
     * make uninstall now properly uninstalls all files
     * Passing the no longer available --with-nssdir configuration option
       now results in a hard error.
     * GNUNET_memcmp() and GNUNET_is_zero() macros introduced for improved
       type safety (but not yet used consistently).

2019-02: GNUnet 0.11.0 released

   We are pleased to announce the release of GNUnet 0.11.0.

   This is a major release after about five years of development. In terms
   of usability, users should be aware that there are still a large number
   of known open issues in particular with respect to ease of use, but
   also some critical privacy issues especially for mobile users. Also,
   the nascent network is tiny (about 200 peers) and thus unlikely to

Noteworthy changes in 0.11.0

     * The Web site and manuals have undergone significant rework. You can
       find an archive of the old Web site at archive.org.
     * The code now builds again on macOS. GNUnet on macOS is
       experimental. While it builds and seems to run fine, some tests are
       known to fail.
     * Build process now works properly with libidn2
     * Except for gnunet-qr, all Python code was migrated to Python 3.7.
     * Fixed security issues in secret sharing cryptography logic
     * Services running out of file descriptors on accept() no longer busy
       wait
     * Fixed crash in gnunet-gns2dns proxy
     * GNS responses are now padded to minimize information disclosure
       from the size
     * Fixed API issues and (rare) crash bugs in CADET
     * The experimental SecuShare code is not included in the release, you
       can now find it in the gnunet-secushare Git repository.
     * The Ascension tool (separate download) now allows importing DNS
       zones into GNS via AXFR.
     * GNUnet now includes a decentralised identity attribute sharing
       service: reclaimID. A ready-to-use client can be found in an
       external repo.
     * The code now builds again on NetBSD. GNUnet on NetBSD is
       experimental. While it builds and seems to run fine, full support
       requires more changes in the core of GNUnet It will soon be
       available via pkgsrc.
     * Many things changed on the build system side. If you package GNUnet
       for an operating system or otherwise package manager, make sure
       that you read the README.

   The above is just the short list, our bugtracker lists over 100
   individual issues that were resolved since 0.11.0pre66.

Android Port

   It is time for GNUnet to run properly on Android. Note that GNUnet is
   written in C, and this is not about rewriting GNUnet in Java, but about
   getting the C code to run on Android.

Help with Continuous Integration setup

   There is a push for migrating our CI to Gitlab. The CI should
   eventually not just run "make check" on various platforms, but also
   perform tests with multiple peers running in different VMs with
   specific network topologies (i.e. NAT) between them being simulated.
   The CI should also be integrated with Gauger for performance regression
   analysis. Running jobs only when dependencies have changed and
   scripting more granular triggers or ideally automatic dependency
   discovery (as done by the autotools) is also important.
   Mentor: TBD

Migrate gnunet-qr from Python 2.7 to C using libzbar

   Python 2.7 is reaching its end-of-life, and we want to get rid of the
   dependency on Python. The existing gnunet-qr tool is a rather simple
   wrapper around python-zbar, which itself wraps libzbar. The goal of
   this project is to directly use libzbar to scan QR codes for GNUnet /
   the GNU Name System (see also #5562).

re:claimID OpenID Connect performance improvements

   reclaimID is a decentralized identity system build on top of the GNU
   Name System. Upon authorization, the user provides a requesting party
   (RP) such as a website with an authorization ticket (e.g. piggybacked
   in an OpenID authorization code). The RP uses information contained in
   this ticket to
    1. Retrieve the decryption key from GNS
    2. Retrieve the user attributes from GNS

   The GNS lookups ensure that the RP receives up-to-date attributes and
   functional decryption keys. However, in particular the RP-specific
   encryption key resolution can be slow and even fail depending on the
   network topology. We propose that in an initial exchange, in particular
   OpenID authorization code flows, we try to incorporate key and maybe
   even an attribute set in the ticket exchange. In order to mitigate this
   issue, this project is meant to investigate and implement how...
    1. ... decryption keys can be added to an initial exchange in OpenID.
    2. ... initial set(s) of attributes can be piggybacked in OpenID.

   Mentor: Martin Schanzenbach

re:claimID alternative GNS-based encryption

   re:claimID is a decentralized identity system build on top of the GNU
   Name System. The initial design and implementation of re:claimID
   includes an attribute-based encryption module in order to prevent
   unauthorized access to attributes in the name system. Our motivation
   for re:claimID was for it to be name system agnostic, which means the
   design theoretically also works for other name systems such as
   namecoin. Other name systems often do not have built-in mechanisms in
   order to do this. Hence, we implemented an ABE access control layer.
   Our ABE implementation requires two third party libraries: libpbc and
   libgabe. While we could merge libgabe into the gnunet service
   implementation of re:claimID, libpbc is a rather large, third party
   library which lacks packaging in distributions and for platforms. On
   the other hand, GNS supports record data encryption using symmetric
   keys as labels. If we make the access control layer of re:claimID more
   generic in order to support both ABE and GNS encryption, we could
   reduce the required depenencies. This would result in gnunet packages
   to include re:claimID by default. In short, the goals are to...
    1. ... improve performance by reducing encryption overhead.
    2. ... reduce dependencies.

Enable all networking applications to run over GNUnet out of the box

   One great problem of the current Internet is the lack of
   disintermediation. When people want to talk they need a chat service.
   When they want to share files they need a file transfer service.
   Although GNUnet already possesses quite advanced integration into Linux
   networking, a little extra work is needed for existing applications
   like irc, www, ftp, rsh, nntpd to run over it in a peer-to-peer way,
   simply by using a GNS hostname like friend.gnu. Once people have added
   a person to their GNS they can immediately message, exchange files and
   suchlike directly, with nothing but the GNUnet in the middle, using
   applications that have been distributed with unix systems ever since
   the 1980's. We can produce an OS distribution where these things work
   out of the box with the nicknames of people instead of cloud services.
   For more information and context, read bug id 4625.

   Notice: GNUnet is still undergoing major development. It is largely not
   yet ready for usage beyond developers

                                   GNUnet

   GNUnet is a new network protocol stack for building secure,
   distributed, and privacy-preserving applications. With strong roots in
   academic research, our goal is to replace the old insecure Internet
   protocol stack.
   GNUnet is typically run as an overlay network on top of the existing
   Internet infrastructure forming the basis of a hybrid peer-to-peer mesh
   and relay backbone for applications to run on. It could just as well be
   run independently of the Internet, over dedicated radio and cable.
   GNUnet is made for a free and open society: It's a self-organizing
   network and it is free software as in freedom. GNUnet puts you in
   control of your data. You determine which data to share with whom, and
   you're not pressured to accept compromises.

The Internet of tomorrow needs GNUnet today

Imagine...

   The conventional Internet is currently like a system of roads with deep
   potholes and highwaymen all over the place. Even if you still can use
   the roads (e.g. send emails, or browse websites) your vehicle might get
   hijacked, damaged, or long arms might reach into its back and steal
   your items (data) to use it against you and sell it to others - while
   you can't even notice the thievery nor accuse and hold the scroungers
   accountable.

The Internet is broken

   Protocols from Ethernet and IP to BGP and X.509 PKI are insecure by
   default: protecting against address forgery, routers learning metadata,
   or choosing trustworthy CAs is nontrivial and sometimes impossible.

   GNUnet provides privacy by design, improving addressing, routing,
   naming and content distribution in a technically robust manner - as
   opposed to ad-hoc designs in place today.

Decentralization is hard

   Instead of sharing common components and tools for building P2P
   systems, every P2P project seems to re-invent the wheel. This heightens
   the effort and increases the potential number of vulnerabilities.

   GNUnet is a metadata-preserving foundation for your application,
   covering areas from addressing to reliable bidirectional
   Axolotl-encrypted channels, with advanced routing. Our work is based on
   continuous research spanning almost two decades.

Metadata is exposed

   Your metadata is just as revealing as the actual content; and it gets
   exposed on the Internet.
   Even though transport encryption is increasingly being deployed on the
   Internet, it still reveals data that can threaten democracy: the
   identities of senders and receivers, the times, frequency and the
   volume of communication are all still revealed.
   GNUnet addresses these concerns with perfect forward secrecy via
   ephemeral public key addressing, fixed packet size to hinder traffic
   analysis, layered encryption, Sybil-resistant routing, and more.

Freedoms are not respected

   Today, monitoring increasingly centralized infrastructure, proprietary
   implementations, traffic shapers and firewalls restrict all of the
   essential freedoms to various degrees.

   GNUnet gives users freedoms to securely access information ("run" the
   network), to study all aspects of the network's operation ("access the
   code"), to distribute information ("copy"), as well as the freedom to
   deploy new applications ("modify").

Über GNUnet

   If you want to know more about the GNUnet please continue reading the
   about page. There are much more resources, such as the main handbook /
   reference manual, a bibliography and videos.

   You are very welcome to get engaged into the conversation, install
   GNUnet, use it and contribute.
   Be aware that this project is still in an early alpha stage when it
   comes to software – its not an easy task to rewrite the whole Internet!

Featured Applications

GNU Taler (Alpha)

   GNU Taler is a new privacy-preserving electronic payment system.
   Payments are cryptographically secured and are confirmed within
   milliseconds with extremely low transaction costs.

The GNU Name System

   The GNU Name System (GNS) is a fully decentralized replacement for the
   Domain Name System (DNS). Instead of using a hierarchy, GNS uses a
   directed graph. Naming conventions are similar to DNS, but queries and
   replies are private even with respect to peers providing the answers.
   The integrity of records and privacy of look-ups is cryptographically
   secured.

re:claimID

   re:claimID is a decentralized Identity Provider (IdP) service built in
   top of the GNU Name System. It allows users to securely share personal
   information with websites using standardized protocols (OpenID
   Connect).

Filesharing (Alpha)

   GNUnet filesharing is an application that aims to provide
   censorship-resistant, anonymous filesharing. The publisher is empowered
   to make a gradual choice between performance and anonymity.

Conversation (Pre-Alpha)

   GNUnet conversation is an application that provides secure voice
   communication in a fully decentralized way by employing GNUnet for
   routing and transport.

Upcoming Applications

secushare

   secushare is creating a decentralized social networking application on
   top of GNUnet. Using overlay multicast and the extensible PSYC
   protocol, notifications are distributed end-to-end encrypted to
   authorized recipients only.

pretty Easy privacy

   pretty Easy privacy (p≡p) is creating a usable end-to-end encrypted
   e-mail solution using opportunistic key exchange. p≡p will use GNUnet
   to protect metadata and exploit new cryptographic protocols to verify
   keys.

2019-07-24: GNUnet 0.11.6 released

   We are pleased to announce the release of GNUnet 0.11.6.

   This is a bugfix release for 0.11.5, fixing a lot of minor bugs,
   improving stability and code quality. Further, our videos are back on
   the homepage. In this release, we again improved the webpage in general
   and updated our documentation. As always: In terms of usability, users
   should be aware that there are still a large number of known open
   issues in particular with respect to ease of use, but also some
   critical privacy issues especially for mobile users. Also, the nascent
   network is tiny (about 200 peers) and thus unlikely to provide good
   anonymity or extensive amounts of interesting information. As a result,
   the 0.11.6 release is still only suitable for early adopters with some
   reasonable pain tolerance.

     * http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gnunet/gnunet-fuse-0.11.0.tar.gz.sig

   gnunet-fuse was not released again, as there were no changes and the
   0.11.0 versions are expected to continue to work fine with
   gnunet-0.11.6.

   Note that due to mirror synchronization, not all links might be
   functional early after the release. For direct access try

Noteworthy changes in 0.11.6 (since 0.11.5)

     * gnunet-identity can now print private keys.
     * The REST service can be configured to echo the HTTP Origin header
       value for Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing (CORS) when it is called by
       a browser plugin. Optionally, a CORS Origin to echo can be also be
       directly configured.
     * re:claimID tickets are now re-used whenever possible.
     * SUID binary detection mechanisms implemented to improve
       compatiblity with some distributions.
     * TRANSPORT, TESTBED and CADET tests now pass again on macOS.
     * CADET: Replaced enum GNUNET_CADET_ChannelOption with
       GNUNET_MQ_PriorityPreferences in preparation of API changed in the
       future.
     * The GNS proxy Certification Authority is now generated using
       gnutls-certtool, if available, with opennssl/certtool as fallback.
     * Documentation, comments and code quality was improved.

Known Issues

     * There are known major design issues in the TRANSPORT, ATS and CORE
       subsystems which will need to be addressed in the future to achieve
       acceptable usability, performance and security.
     * There are known moderate implementation limitations in CADET that
       negatively impact performance.
     * There are known moderate design issues in FS that also impact
       usability and performance.
     * There are minor implementation limitations in SET that create
       unnecessary attack surface for availability.
     * The RPS subsystem remains experimental.
     * Some high-level tests in the test-suite fail non-deterministically
       due to the low-level TRANSPORT issues.

   In addition to this list, you may also want to consult our bug tracker
   at bugs.gnunet.org which lists about 190 more specific issues.

2019-06-28: Peer DSTJ is dead, long live peer Y924

   After some issues with our infrastructure we needed to replace our
   bootstrapping peer. To avoid problems when connecting to GNUnet the
   operator of a peer needs to update its node by removing the peer ID
   DSTJBRRKZ8TBW3FGK6B0M5QXWT9WYNZ45H5MCV4HY7ST64Q8T9F0 from the system.
   Here are two strategies to find copies of the respective file:

    1. $ locate DSTJBRRKZ8TBW3FGK6B0M5QXWT9WYNZ45H5MCV4HY7ST64Q8T9F0
    2. $ find / -name DSTJBRRKZ8TBW3FGK6B0M5QXWT9WYNZ45H5MCV4HY7ST64Q8T9F0

   Update: DSTJ has now been blacklisted. Please update your GNUnet peer.

2019-06-28: GNUnet Hacker Meeting 2019 at La Décentrale, Switzerland

   The members of the GNUnet community met again in the wonderful
   souroundings of St. Imier to hack on GNUnet. New people joined our
   sessions until late at night. From bug squashing to digging our own dog
   food, from workshops to theoretical discussions of new services and
   usecases. And of course, pizza was in the game.

2019-06-05: GNUnet 0.11.5 released

   We are pleased to announce the release of GNUnet 0.11.5.

   This is a bugfix release for 0.11.4, mostly fixing a few minor bugs and
   improving performance, in particular for identity management with a
   large number of egos. In the wake of this release, we also launched the
   REST API documentation. In terms of usability, users should be aware
   that there are still a large number of known open issues in particular
   with respect to ease of use, but also some critical privacy issues
   especially for mobile users. Also, the nascent network is tiny (about
   200 peers) and thus unlikely to provide good anonymity or extensive
   amounts of interesting information. As a result, the 0.11.5 release is
   still only suitable for early adopters with some reasonable pain
   tolerance.

   gnunet-gtk saw some minor changes to adopt it to API changes in the
   main code related to the identity improvements. gnunet-fuse was not
   released again, as there were no changes and the 0.11.0 version is
   expected to continue to work fine with gnunet-0.11.5.

   Note that due to mirror synchronization, not all links might be

Noteworthy changes in 0.11.5 (since 0.11.4)

     * gnunet-identity is much faster when creating or deleting egos given
       a large number of existing egos.
     * GNS now supports CAA records.
     * Documentation, comments and code quality was improved.

Known Issues

     * There are known major design issues in the TRANSPORT, ATS and CORE
       subsystems which will need to be addressed in the future to achieve
       acceptable usability, performance and security.

2019-02: GNUnet 0.11.0 released

   We are pleased to announce the release of GNUnet 0.11.0.

   This is a major release after about five years of development. In terms
   of usability, users should be aware that there are still a large number
   of known open issues in particular with respect to ease of use, but
   also some critical privacy issues especially for mobile users. Also,
   the nascent network is tiny (about 200 peers) and thus unlikely to
   provide good anonymity or extensive amounts of interesting information.
   As a result, the 0.11.0 release is still only suitable for early
   adopters with some reasonable pain tolerance.

Noteworthy changes in 0.11.0

     * The Web site and manuals have undergone significant rework. You can
       find an archive of the old Web site at archive.org.
     * The code now builds again on macOS. GNUnet on macOS is
       experimental. While it builds and seems to run fine, some tests are
       known to fail.
     * Build process now works properly with libidn2
     * Except for gnunet-qr, all Python code was migrated to Python 3.7.
     * Fixed security issues in secret sharing cryptography logic
     * Services running out of file descriptors on accept() no longer busy
       wait
     * Fixed crash in gnunet-gns2dns proxy
     * GNS responses are now padded to minimize information disclosure
       from the size
     * Fixed API issues and (rare) crash bugs in CADET
     * The experimental SecuShare code is not included in the release, you
       can now find it in the gnunet-secushare Git repository.
     * The Ascension tool (separate download) now allows importing DNS
       zones into GNS via AXFR.
     * GNUnet now includes a decentralised identity attribute sharing
       service: reclaimID. A ready-to-use client can be found in an
       external repo.
     * The code now builds again on NetBSD. GNUnet on NetBSD is
       experimental. While it builds and seems to run fine, full support
       requires more changes in the core of GNUnet It will soon be
       available via pkgsrc.
     * Many things changed on the build system side. If you package GNUnet
       for an operating system or otherwise package manager, make sure
       that you read the README.

   The above is just the short list, our bugtracker lists over 100
   individual issues that were resolved since 0.11.0pre66.

Known Issues

     * There are known major design issues in the TRANSPORT, ATS and CORE
       subsystems which will need to be addressed in the future to achieve
       acceptable usability, performance and security.
     * There are known moderate implementation limitations in CADET that
       negatively impact performance. Also CADET may unexpectedly deliver
       messages out-of-order.
     * There are known moderate design issues in FS that also impact
       usability and performance.
     * There are minor implementation limitations in SET that create
       unnecessary attack surface for availability.
     * The RPS subsystem remains experimental.
     * Some high-level tests in the test-suite fail non-deterministically
       due to the low-level TRANSPORT issues.

   In addition to this list, you may also want to consult our bug tracker
   at bugs.gnunet.org which lists about 150 more specific issues.

Android Port

   It is time for GNUnet to run properly on Android. Note that GNUnet is
   written in C, and this is not about rewriting GNUnet in Java, but about
   getting the C code to run on Android.

Help with Continuous Integration setup

   There is a push for migrating our CI to Gitlab. The CI should
   eventually not just run "make check" on various platforms, but also
   perform tests with multiple peers running in different VMs with
   specific network topologies (i.e. NAT) between them being simulated.
   The CI should also be integrated with Gauger for performance regression
   analysis. Running jobs only when dependencies have changed and
   scripting more granular triggers or ideally automatic dependency
   discovery (as done by the autotools) is also important.
   Mentor: TBD

Migrate gnunet-qr from Python 2.7 to C using libzbar

   Python 2.7 is reaching its end-of-life, and we want to get rid of the
   dependency on Python. The existing gnunet-qr tool is a rather simple
   wrapper around python-zbar, which itself wraps libzbar. The goal of
   this project is to directly use libzbar to scan QR codes for GNUnet /
   the GNU Name System (see also #5562).

re:claimID OpenID Connect performance improvements

   reclaimID is a decentralized identity system build on top of the GNU
   Name System. Upon authorization, the user provides a requesting party
   (RP) such as a website with an authorization ticket (e.g. piggybacked
   in an OpenID authorization code). The RP uses information contained in
   this ticket to
    1. Retrieve the decryption key from GNS
    2. Retrieve the user attributes from GNS

   The GNS lookups ensure that the RP receives up-to-date attributes and
   functional decryption keys. However, in particular the RP-specific
   encryption key resolution can be slow and even fail depending on the
   network topology. We propose that in an initial exchange, in particular
   OpenID authorization code flows, we try to incorporate key and maybe
   even an attribute set in the ticket exchange. In order to mitigate this
   issue, this project is meant to investigate and implement how...
    1. ... decryption keys can be added to an initial exchange in OpenID.
    2. ... initial set(s) of attributes can be piggybacked in OpenID.

   Mentor: Martin Schanzenbach

re:claimID alternative GNS-based encryption

   re:claimID is a decentralized identity system build on top of the GNU
   Name System. The initial design and implementation of re:claimID
   includes an attribute-based encryption module in order to prevent
   unauthorized access to attributes in the name system. Our motivation
   for re:claimID was for it to be name system agnostic, which means the
   design theoretically also works for other name systems such as
   namecoin. Other name systems often do not have built-in mechanisms in
   order to do this. Hence, we implemented an ABE access control layer.
   Our ABE implementation requires two third party libraries: libpbc and
   libgabe. While we could merge libgabe into the gnunet service
   implementation of re:claimID, libpbc is a rather large, third party
   library which lacks packaging in distributions and for platforms. On
   the other hand, GNS supports record data encryption using symmetric
   keys as labels. If we make the access control layer of re:claimID more
   generic in order to support both ABE and GNS encryption, we could
   reduce the required depenencies. This would result in gnunet packages
   to include re:claimID by default. In short, the goals are to...
    1. ... improve performance by reducing encryption overhead.
    2. ... reduce dependencies.

Enable all networking applications to run over GNUnet out of the box

   One great problem of the current Internet is the lack of
   disintermediation. When people want to talk they need a chat service.
   When they want to share files they need a file transfer service.
   Although GNUnet already possesses quite advanced integration into Linux
   networking, a little extra work is needed for existing applications
   like irc, www, ftp, rsh, nntpd to run over it in a peer-to-peer way,
   simply by using a GNS hostname like friend.gnu. Once people have added
   a person to their GNS they can immediately message, exchange files and
   suchlike directly, with nothing but the GNUnet in the middle, using
   applications that have been distributed with unix systems ever since
   the 1980's. We can produce an OS distribution where these things work
   out of the box with the nicknames of people instead of cloud services.
   For more information and context, read bug id 4625.

   Notice: GNUnet is still undergoing major development. It is largely not
   yet ready for usage beyond developers

                                   GNUnet

   GNUnet is a new network protocol stack for building secure,
   distributed, and privacy-preserving applications. With strong roots in
   academic research, our goal is to replace the old insecure Internet
   protocol stack.
   GNUnet is typically run as an overlay network on top of the existing
   Internet infrastructure forming the basis of a hybrid peer-to-peer mesh
   and relay backbone for applications to run on. It could just as well be
   run independently of the Internet, over dedicated radio and cable.
   GNUnet is made for a free and open society: It's a self-organizing
   network and it is free software as in freedom. GNUnet puts you in
   control of your data. You determine which data to share with whom, and
   you're not pressured to accept compromises.

   About   Install   Engage

The Internet of tomorrow needs GNUnet today

Imagine...

   The conventional Internet is currently like a system of roads with deep
   potholes and highwaymen all over the place. Even if you still can use
   the roads (e.g. send emails, or browse websites) your vehicle might get
   hijacked, damaged, or long arms might reach into its back and steal
   your items (data) to use it against you and sell it to others - while
   you can't even notice the thievery nor accuse and hold the scroungers
   accountable.

The Internet is broken

   Protocols from Ethernet and IP to BGP and X.509 PKI are insecure by
   default: protecting against address forgery, routers learning metadata,
   or choosing trustworthy CAs is nontrivial and sometimes impossible.

   GNUnet provides privacy by design, improving addressing, routing,
   naming and content distribution in a technically robust manner - as
   opposed to ad-hoc designs in place today.

Decentralization is hard

   Instead of sharing common components and tools for building P2P
   systems, every P2P project seems to re-invent the wheel. This heightens
   the effort and increases the potential number of vulnerabilities.

   GNUnet is a metadata-preserving foundation for your application,
   covering areas from addressing to reliable bidirectional
   Axolotl-encrypted channels, with advanced routing. Our work is based on
   continuous research spanning almost two decades.

Metadata is exposed

   Your metadata is just as revealing as the actual content; and it gets
   exposed on the Internet.
   Even though transport encryption is increasingly being deployed on the
   Internet, it still reveals data that can threaten democracy: the
   identities of senders and receivers, the times, frequency and the
   volume of communication are all still revealed.
   GNUnet addresses these concerns with perfect forward secrecy via
   ephemeral public key addressing, fixed packet size to hinder traffic
   analysis, layered encryption, Sybil-resistant routing, and more.

Freedoms are not respected

   Today, monitoring increasingly centralized infrastructure, proprietary
   implementations, traffic shapers and firewalls restrict all of the
   essential freedoms to various degrees.

   GNUnet gives users freedoms to securely access information ("run" the
   network), to study all aspects of the network's operation ("access the
   code"), to distribute information ("copy"), as well as the freedom to
   deploy new applications ("modify").

Learn more about GNUnet

   If you want to know more about the GNUnet please continue reading the
   about page. There are much more resources, such as the main handbook /
   reference manual, a bibliography and videos.

   You are very welcome to get engaged into the conversation, install
   GNUnet, use it and contribute.
   Be aware that this project is still in an early alpha stage when it
   comes to software – its not an easy task to rewrite the whole Internet!

Featured Applications

GNU Taler (Alpha)

   GNU Taler is a new privacy-preserving electronic payment system.
   Payments are cryptographically secured and are confirmed within
   milliseconds with extremely low transaction costs.

The GNU Name System

   The GNU Name System (GNS) is a fully decentralized replacement for the
   Domain Name System (DNS). Instead of using a hierarchy, GNS uses a
   directed graph. Naming conventions are similar to DNS, but queries and
   replies are private even with respect to peers providing the answers.
   The integrity of records and privacy of look-ups is cryptographically
   secured.

re:claimID

   re:claimID is a decentralized Identity Provider (IdP) service built in
   top of the GNU Name System. It allows users to securely share personal
   information with websites using standardized protocols (OpenID
   Connect).

Filesharing (Alpha)

   GNUnet filesharing is an application that aims to provide
   censorship-resistant, anonymous filesharing. The publisher is empowered
   to make a gradual choice between performance and anonymity.

Conversation (Pre-Alpha)

   GNUnet conversation is an application that provides secure voice
   communication in a fully decentralized way by employing GNUnet for
   routing and transport.

Upcoming Applications

secushare

   secushare is creating a decentralized social networking application on
   top of GNUnet. Using overlay multicast and the extensible PSYC
   protocol, notifications are distributed end-to-end encrypted to
   authorized recipients only.

pretty Easy privacy

   pretty Easy privacy (p≡p) is creating a usable end-to-end encrypted
   e-mail solution using opportunistic key exchange. p≡p will use GNUnet
   to protect metadata and exploit new cryptographic protocols to verify
   keys.

News

2019-07-24: GNUnet 0.11.6 released

   We are pleased to announce the release of GNUnet 0.11.6.

   This is a bugfix release for 0.11.5, fixing a lot of minor bugs,
   improving stability and code quality. Further, our videos are back on
   the homepage. In this release, we again improved the webpage in general
   and updated our documentation. As always: In terms of usability, users
   should be aware that there are still a large number of known open
   issues in particular with respect to ease of use, but also some
   critical privacy issues especially for mobile users. Also, the nascent
   network is tiny (about 200 peers) and thus unlikely to provide good
   anonymity or extensive amounts of interesting information. As a result,
   the 0.11.6 release is still only suitable for early adopters with some
   reasonable pain tolerance.

     * http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gnunet/gnunet-fuse-0.11.0.tar.gz.sig

   gnunet-fuse was not released again, as there were no changes and the
   0.11.0 versions are expected to continue to work fine with
   gnunet-0.11.6.

   Note that due to mirror synchronization, not all links might be
   functional early after the release. For direct access try
   http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnunet/

Noteworthy changes in 0.11.6 (since 0.11.5)

     * gnunet-identity can now print private keys.
     * The REST service can be configured to echo the HTTP Origin header
       value for Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing (CORS) when it is called by
       a browser plugin. Optionally, a CORS Origin to echo can be also be
       directly configured.
     * re:claimID tickets are now re-used whenever possible.
     * SUID binary detection mechanisms implemented to improve
       compatiblity with some distributions.
     * TRANSPORT, TESTBED and CADET tests now pass again on macOS.
     * CADET: Replaced enum GNUNET_CADET_ChannelOption with
       GNUNET_MQ_PriorityPreferences in preparation of API changed in the
       future.
     * The GNS proxy Certification Authority is now generated using
       gnutls-certtool, if available, with opennssl/certtool as fallback.
     * Documentation, comments and code quality was improved.

Known Issues

     * There are known major design issues in the TRANSPORT, ATS and CORE
       subsystems which will need to be addressed in the future to achieve
       acceptable usability, performance and security.
     * There are known moderate implementation limitations in CADET that
       negatively impact performance.
     * There are known moderate design issues in FS that also impact
       usability and performance.
     * There are minor implementation limitations in SET that create
       unnecessary attack surface for availability.
     * The RPS subsystem remains experimental.
     * Some high-level tests in the test-suite fail non-deterministically
       due to the low-level TRANSPORT issues.

2019-06-28: Peer DSTJ is dead, long live peer Y924

   After some issues with our infrastructure we needed to replace our
   bootstrapping peer. To avoid problems when connecting to GNUnet the
   operator of a peer needs to update its node by removing the peer ID
   DSTJBRRKZ8TBW3FGK6B0M5QXWT9WYNZ45H5MCV4HY7ST64Q8T9F0 from the system.
   Here are two strategies to find copies of the respective file:

    1. $ locate DSTJBRRKZ8TBW3FGK6B0M5QXWT9WYNZ45H5MCV4HY7ST64Q8T9F0
    2. $ find / -name DSTJBRRKZ8TBW3FGK6B0M5QXWT9WYNZ45H5MCV4HY7ST64Q8T9F0

   Update: DSTJ has now been blacklisted. Please update your GNUnet peer.

2019-06-28: GNUnet Hacker Meeting 2019 at La Décentrale, Switzerland

   The members of the GNUnet community met again in the wonderful
   souroundings of St. Imier to hack on GNUnet. New people joined our
   sessions until late at night. From bug squashing to digging our own dog
   food, from workshops to theoretical discussions of new services and
   usecases. And of course, pizza was in the game.

2019-06-05: GNUnet 0.11.5 released

   We are pleased to announce the release of GNUnet 0.11.5.

   This is a bugfix release for 0.11.4, mostly fixing a few minor bugs and
   improving performance, in particular for identity management with a
   large number of egos. In the wake of this release, we also launched the
   REST API documentation. In terms of usability, users should be aware
   that there are still a large number of known open issues in particular
   with respect to ease of use, but also some critical privacy issues
   especially for mobile users. Also, the nascent network is tiny (about

Noteworthy changes in 0.11.5 (since 0.11.4)

     * gnunet-identity is much faster when creating or deleting egos given
       a large number of existing egos.
     * GNS now supports CAA records.
     * Documentation, comments and code quality was improved.

Noteworthy changes in 0.11.3 (since 0.11.2)

     * gnunet-zoneimport now handles -h correctly
     * iptables and other similar binaries are no longer hard-coded but
       detected at configure time (with hard-coded fallback locations).
     * make uninstall now properly uninstalls all files
     * Passing the no longer available --with-nssdir configuration option
       now results in a hard error.
     * GNUNET_memcmp() and GNUNET_is_zero() macros introduced for improved
       type safety (but not yet used consistently).

Known Issues

     * There are known major design issues in the TRANSPORT, ATS and CORE
       subsystems which will need to be addressed in the future to achieve

2019-04-04: GNUnet 0.11.2 released

   We are pleased to announce the release of GNUnet 0.11.2.

   This is a bugfix release for 0.11.0, mostly fixing minor bugs,
   improving documentation and fixing various build issues. In terms of
   usability, users should be aware that there are still a large number of
   known open issues in particular with respect to ease of use, but also
   some critical privacy issues especially for mobile users. Also, the
   nascent network is tiny (about 200 peers) and thus unlikely to provide
   good anonymity or extensive amounts of interesting information. As a
   result, the 0.11.2 release is still only suitable for early adopters
   with some reasonable pain tolerance.

2019-02: GNUnet 0.11.0 released

   We are pleased to announce the release of GNUnet 0.11.0.

   This is a major release after about five years of development. In terms
   of usability, users should be aware that there are still a large number
   of known open issues in particular with respect to ease of use, but
   also some critical privacy issues especially for mobile users. Also,
   the nascent network is tiny (about 200 peers) and thus unlikely to

Noteworthy changes in 0.11.0

     * The Web site and manuals have undergone significant rework. You can
       find an archive of the old Web site at archive.org.
     * The code now builds again on macOS. GNUnet on macOS is
       experimental. While it builds and seems to run fine, some tests are
       known to fail.
     * Build process now works properly with libidn2
     * Except for gnunet-qr, all Python code was migrated to Python 3.7.
     * Fixed security issues in secret sharing cryptography logic
     * Services running out of file descriptors on accept() no longer busy
       wait
     * Fixed crash in gnunet-gns2dns proxy
     * GNS responses are now padded to minimize information disclosure
       from the size
     * Fixed API issues and (rare) crash bugs in CADET
     * The experimental SecuShare code is not included in the release, you
       can now find it in the gnunet-secushare Git repository.
     * The Ascension tool (separate download) now allows importing DNS
       zones into GNS via AXFR.
     * GNUnet now includes a decentralised identity attribute sharing
       service: reclaimID. A ready-to-use client can be found in an
       external repo.
     * The code now builds again on NetBSD. GNUnet on NetBSD is
       experimental. While it builds and seems to run fine, full support
       requires more changes in the core of GNUnet It will soon be
       available via pkgsrc.
     * Many things changed on the build system side. If you package GNUnet
       for an operating system or otherwise package manager, make sure
       that you read the README.

   The above is just the short list, our bugtracker lists over 100

Android Port

   It is time for GNUnet to run properly on Android. Note that GNUnet is
   written in C, and this is not about rewriting GNUnet in Java, but about
   getting the C code to run on Android.

Help with Continuous Integration setup

   There is a push for migrating our CI to Gitlab. The CI should
   eventually not just run "make check" on various platforms, but also
   perform tests with multiple peers running in different VMs with
   specific network topologies (i.e. NAT) between them being simulated.
   The CI should also be integrated with Gauger for performance regression
   analysis. Running jobs only when dependencies have changed and
   scripting more granular triggers or ideally automatic dependency
   discovery (as done by the autotools) is also important.
   Mentor: TBD

Migrate gnunet-qr from Python 2.7 to C using libzbar

   Python 2.7 is reaching its end-of-life, and we want to get rid of the
   dependency on Python. The existing gnunet-qr tool is a rather simple
   wrapper around python-zbar, which itself wraps libzbar. The goal of
   this project is to directly use libzbar to scan QR codes for GNUnet /
   the GNU Name System (see also #5562).

re:claimID OpenID Connect performance improvements

   reclaimID is a decentralized identity system build on top of the GNU
   Name System. Upon authorization, the user provides a requesting party
   (RP) such as a website with an authorization ticket (e.g. piggybacked
   in an OpenID authorization code). The RP uses information contained in
   this ticket to
    1. Retrieve the decryption key from GNS
    2. Retrieve the user attributes from GNS

   The GNS lookups ensure that the RP receives up-to-date attributes and
   functional decryption keys. However, in particular the RP-specific
   encryption key resolution can be slow and even fail depending on the
   network topology. We propose that in an initial exchange, in particular
   OpenID authorization code flows, we try to incorporate key and maybe
   even an attribute set in the ticket exchange. In order to mitigate this
   issue, this project is meant to investigate and implement how...
    1. ... decryption keys can be added to an initial exchange in OpenID.
    2. ... initial set(s) of attributes can be piggybacked in OpenID.

   Mentor: Martin Schanzenbach

re:claimID alternative GNS-based encryption

   re:claimID is a decentralized identity system build on top of the GNU
   Name System. The initial design and implementation of re:claimID
   includes an attribute-based encryption module in order to prevent
   unauthorized access to attributes in the name system. Our motivation
   for re:claimID was for it to be name system agnostic, which means the
   design theoretically also works for other name systems such as
   namecoin. Other name systems often do not have built-in mechanisms in
   order to do this. Hence, we implemented an ABE access control layer.
   Our ABE implementation requires two third party libraries: libpbc and
   libgabe. While we could merge libgabe into the gnunet service
   implementation of re:claimID, libpbc is a rather large, third party
   library which lacks packaging in distributions and for platforms. On
   the other hand, GNS supports record data encryption using symmetric
   keys as labels. If we make the access control layer of re:claimID more
   generic in order to support both ABE and GNS encryption, we could
   reduce the required depenencies. This would result in gnunet packages
   to include re:claimID by default. In short, the goals are to...
    1. ... improve performance by reducing encryption overhead.
    2. ... reduce dependencies.

Enable all networking applications to run over GNUnet out of the box

   One great problem of the current Internet is the lack of
   disintermediation. When people want to talk they need a chat service.
   When they want to share files they need a file transfer service.
   Although GNUnet already possesses quite advanced integration into Linux
   networking, a little extra work is needed for existing applications
   like irc, www, ftp, rsh, nntpd to run over it in a peer-to-peer way,
   simply by using a GNS hostname like friend.gnu. Once people have added
   a person to their GNS they can immediately message, exchange files and
   suchlike directly, with nothing but the GNUnet in the middle, using
   applications that have been distributed with unix systems ever since
   the 1980's. We can produce an OS distribution where these things work
   out of the box with the nicknames of people instead of cloud services.
   For more information and context, read bug id 4625.

   Notice: GNUnet is still undergoing major development. It is largely not
   yet ready for usage beyond developers

                                   GNUnet

   GNUnet is a new network protocol stack for building secure,
   distributed, and privacy-preserving applications. With strong roots in
   academic research, our goal is to replace the old insecure Internet
   protocol stack.
   GNUnet is typically run as an overlay network on top of the existing
   Internet infrastructure forming the basis of a hybrid peer-to-peer mesh
   and relay backbone for applications to run on. It could just as well be
   run independently of the Internet, over dedicated radio and cable.
   GNUnet is made for a free and open society: It's a self-organizing
   network and it is free software as in freedom. GNUnet puts you in
   control of your data. You determine which data to share with whom, and
   you're not pressured to accept compromises.

The Internet of tomorrow needs GNUnet today

Imagine...

   The conventional Internet is currently like a system of roads with deep
   potholes and highwaymen all over the place. Even if you still can use
   the roads (e.g. send emails, or browse websites) your vehicle might get
   hijacked, damaged, or long arms might reach into its back and steal
   your items (data) to use it against you and sell it to others - while
   you can't even notice the thievery nor accuse and hold the scroungers
   accountable.

The Internet is broken

   Protocols from Ethernet and IP to BGP and X.509 PKI are insecure by
   default: protecting against address forgery, routers learning metadata,
   or choosing trustworthy CAs is nontrivial and sometimes impossible.

   GNUnet provides privacy by design, improving addressing, routing,
   naming and content distribution in a technically robust manner - as
   opposed to ad-hoc designs in place today.

Decentralization is hard

   Instead of sharing common components and tools for building P2P
   systems, every P2P project seems to re-invent the wheel. This heightens
   the effort and increases the potential number of vulnerabilities.

   GNUnet is a metadata-preserving foundation for your application,
   covering areas from addressing to reliable bidirectional
   Axolotl-encrypted channels, with advanced routing. Our work is based on
   continuous research spanning almost two decades.

Metadata is exposed

   Your metadata is just as revealing as the actual content; and it gets
   exposed on the Internet.
   Even though transport encryption is increasingly being deployed on the
   Internet, it still reveals data that can threaten democracy: the
   identities of senders and receivers, the times, frequency and the
   volume of communication are all still revealed.
   GNUnet addresses these concerns with perfect forward secrecy via
   ephemeral public key addressing, fixed packet size to hinder traffic
   analysis, layered encryption, Sybil-resistant routing, and more.

Freedoms are not respected

   Today, monitoring increasingly centralized infrastructure, proprietary
   implementations, traffic shapers and firewalls restrict all of the
   essential freedoms to various degrees.

   GNUnet gives users freedoms to securely access information ("run" the
   network), to study all aspects of the network's operation ("access the
   code"), to distribute information ("copy"), as well as the freedom to
   deploy new applications ("modify").

Sobre GNUnet

   If you want to know more about the GNUnet please continue reading the
   about page. There are much more resources, such as the main handbook /
   reference manual, a bibliography and videos.

   You are very welcome to get engaged into the conversation, install
   GNUnet, use it and contribute.
   Be aware that this project is still in an early alpha stage when it
   comes to software – its not an easy task to rewrite the whole Internet!

Featured Applications

GNU Taler (Alpha)

   GNU Taler is a new privacy-preserving electronic payment system.
   Payments are cryptographically secured and are confirmed within
   milliseconds with extremely low transaction costs.

The GNU Name System

   The GNU Name System (GNS) is a fully decentralized replacement for the
   Domain Name System (DNS). Instead of using a hierarchy, GNS uses a
   directed graph. Naming conventions are similar to DNS, but queries and
   replies are private even with respect to peers providing the answers.
   The integrity of records and privacy of look-ups is cryptographically
   secured.

re:claimID

   re:claimID is a decentralized Identity Provider (IdP) service built in
   top of the GNU Name System. It allows users to securely share personal
   information with websites using standardized protocols (OpenID
   Connect).

Filesharing (Alpha)

   GNUnet filesharing is an application that aims to provide
   censorship-resistant, anonymous filesharing. The publisher is empowered
   to make a gradual choice between performance and anonymity.

Conversation (Pre-Alpha)

   GNUnet conversation is an application that provides secure voice
   communication in a fully decentralized way by employing GNUnet for
   routing and transport.

Upcoming Applications

secushare

   secushare is creating a decentralized social networking application on
   top of GNUnet. Using overlay multicast and the extensible PSYC
   protocol, notifications are distributed end-to-end encrypted to
   authorized recipients only.

pretty Easy privacy

   pretty Easy privacy (p≡p) is creating a usable end-to-end encrypted
   e-mail solution using opportunistic key exchange. p≡p will use GNUnet
   to protect metadata and exploit new cryptographic protocols to verify
   keys.

2019-07-24: GNUnet 0.11.6 released

   We are pleased to announce the release of GNUnet 0.11.6.

   This is a bugfix release for 0.11.5, fixing a lot of minor bugs,
   improving stability and code quality. Further, our videos are back on
   the homepage. In this release, we again improved the webpage in general
   and updated our documentation. As always: In terms of usability, users
   should be aware that there are still a large number of known open
   issues in particular with respect to ease of use, but also some
   critical privacy issues especially for mobile users. Also, the nascent
   network is tiny (about 200 peers) and thus unlikely to provide good
   anonymity or extensive amounts of interesting information. As a result,
   the 0.11.6 release is still only suitable for early adopters with some
   reasonable pain tolerance.

Noteworthy changes in 0.11.6 (since 0.11.5)

     * gnunet-identity can now print private keys.
     * The REST service can be configured to echo the HTTP Origin header
       value for Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing (CORS) when it is called by
       a browser plugin. Optionally, a CORS Origin to echo can be also be
       directly configured.
     * re:claimID tickets are now re-used whenever possible.
     * SUID binary detection mechanisms implemented to improve
       compatiblity with some distributions.
     * TRANSPORT, TESTBED and CADET tests now pass again on macOS.
     * CADET: Replaced enum GNUNET_CADET_ChannelOption with
       GNUNET_MQ_PriorityPreferences in preparation of API changed in the
       future.
     * The GNS proxy Certification Authority is now generated using
       gnutls-certtool, if available, with opennssl/certtool as fallback.
     * Documentation, comments and code quality was improved.

Known Issues

     * There are known major design issues in the TRANSPORT, ATS and CORE
       subsystems which will need to be addressed in the future to achieve
       acceptable usability, performance and security.
     * There are known moderate implementation limitations in CADET that
       negatively impact performance.
     * There are known moderate design issues in FS that also impact
       usability and performance.
     * There are minor implementation limitations in SET that create
       unnecessary attack surface for availability.
     * The RPS subsystem remains experimental.
     * Some high-level tests in the test-suite fail non-deterministically
       due to the low-level TRANSPORT issues.

2019-06-28: Peer DSTJ is dead, long live peer Y924

   After some issues with our infrastructure we needed to replace our
   bootstrapping peer. To avoid problems when connecting to GNUnet the
   operator of a peer needs to update its node by removing the peer ID
   DSTJBRRKZ8TBW3FGK6B0M5QXWT9WYNZ45H5MCV4HY7ST64Q8T9F0 from the system.
   Here are two strategies to find copies of the respective file:

    1. $ locate DSTJBRRKZ8TBW3FGK6B0M5QXWT9WYNZ45H5MCV4HY7ST64Q8T9F0
    2. $ find / -name DSTJBRRKZ8TBW3FGK6B0M5QXWT9WYNZ45H5MCV4HY7ST64Q8T9F0

   Update: DSTJ has now been blacklisted. Please update your GNUnet peer.

2019-06-28: GNUnet Hacker Meeting 2019 at La Décentrale, Switzerland

   The members of the GNUnet community met again in the wonderful
   souroundings of St. Imier to hack on GNUnet. New people joined our
   sessions until late at night. From bug squashing to digging our own dog
   food, from workshops to theoretical discussions of new services and
   usecases. And of course, pizza was in the game.

2019-06-05: GNUnet 0.11.5 released

   We are pleased to announce the release of GNUnet 0.11.5.

   This is a bugfix release for 0.11.4, mostly fixing a few minor bugs and
   improving performance, in particular for identity management with a
   large number of egos. In the wake of this release, we also launched the
   REST API documentation. In terms of usability, users should be aware
   that there are still a large number of known open issues in particular
   with respect to ease of use, but also some critical privacy issues
   especially for mobile users. Also, the nascent network is tiny (about
   200 peers) and thus unlikely to provide good anonymity or extensive
   amounts of interesting information. As a result, the 0.11.5 release is
   still only suitable for early adopters with some reasonable pain
   tolerance.

   gnunet-gtk saw some minor changes to adopt it to API changes in the
   main code related to the identity improvements. gnunet-fuse was not
   released again, as there were no changes and the 0.11.0 version is
   expected to continue to work fine with gnunet-0.11.5.

   Note that due to mirror synchronization, not all links might be
   functional early after the release. For direct access try

Noteworthy changes in 0.11.5 (since 0.11.4)

     * gnunet-identity is much faster when creating or deleting egos given
       a large number of existing egos.
     * GNS now supports CAA records.
     * Documentation, comments and code quality was improved.

Known Issues

     * There are known major design issues in the TRANSPORT, ATS and CORE
       subsystems which will need to be addressed in the future to achieve
       acceptable usability, performance and security.
     * There are known moderate implementation limitations in CADET that

       instead into a logfile (in $GNUNET_HOME).
     * The reclaim subsystem is no longer experimental. See also
       re:claimID. Further, the internal encryption scheme moved from ABE
       to GNS-style encryption.

Noteworthy changes in 0.11.3 (since 0.11.2)

     * gnunet-zoneimport now handles -h correctly
     * iptables and other similar binaries are no longer hard-coded but
       detected at configure time (with hard-coded fallback locations).
     * make uninstall now properly uninstalls all files
     * Passing the no longer available --with-nssdir configuration option
       now results in a hard error.
     * GNUNET_memcmp() and GNUNET_is_zero() macros introduced for improved

2019-02: GNUnet 0.11.0 released

   We are pleased to announce the release of GNUnet 0.11.0.

   This is a major release after about five years of development. In terms
   of usability, users should be aware that there are still a large number
   of known open issues in particular with respect to ease of use, but
   also some critical privacy issues especially for mobile users. Also,
   the nascent network is tiny (about 200 peers) and thus unlikely to

Noteworthy changes in 0.11.0

     * The Web site and manuals have undergone significant rework. You can
       find an archive of the old Web site at archive.org.
     * The code now builds again on macOS. GNUnet on macOS is
       experimental. While it builds and seems to run fine, some tests are
       known to fail.
     * Build process now works properly with libidn2
     * Except for gnunet-qr, all Python code was migrated to Python 3.7.
     * Fixed security issues in secret sharing cryptography logic
     * Services running out of file descriptors on accept() no longer busy
       wait
     * Fixed crash in gnunet-gns2dns proxy
     * GNS responses are now padded to minimize information disclosure
       from the size
     * Fixed API issues and (rare) crash bugs in CADET
     * The experimental SecuShare code is not included in the release, you
       can now find it in the gnunet-secushare Git repository.
     * The Ascension tool (separate download) now allows importing DNS
       zones into GNS via AXFR.
     * GNUnet now includes a decentralised identity attribute sharing
       service: reclaimID. A ready-to-use client can be found in an
       external repo.
     * The code now builds again on NetBSD. GNUnet on NetBSD is
       experimental. While it builds and seems to run fine, full support
       requires more changes in the core of GNUnet It will soon be
       available via pkgsrc.
     * Many things changed on the build system side. If you package GNUnet
       for an operating system or otherwise package manager, make sure
       that you read the README.

   The above is just the short list, our bugtracker lists over 100
   individual issues that were resolved since 0.11.0pre66.

Known Issues

     * There are known major design issues in the TRANSPORT, ATS and CORE
       subsystems which will need to be addressed in the future to achieve
       acceptable usability, performance and security.
     * There are known moderate implementation limitations in CADET that

Android Port

   It is time for GNUnet to run properly on Android. Note that GNUnet is
   written in C, and this is not about rewriting GNUnet in Java, but about
   getting the C code to run on Android.

Help with Continuous Integration setup

   There is a push for migrating our CI to Gitlab. The CI should
   eventually not just run "make check" on various platforms, but also
   perform tests with multiple peers running in different VMs with
   specific network topologies (i.e. NAT) between them being simulated.
   The CI should also be integrated with Gauger for performance regression
   analysis. Running jobs only when dependencies have changed and
   scripting more granular triggers or ideally automatic dependency
   discovery (as done by the autotools) is also important.

Migrate gnunet-qr from Python 2.7 to C using libzbar

   Python 2.7 is reaching its end-of-life, and we want to get rid of the
   dependency on Python. The existing gnunet-qr tool is a rather simple
   wrapper around python-zbar, which itself wraps libzbar. The goal of
   this project is to directly use libzbar to scan QR codes for GNUnet /
   the GNU Name System (see also #5562).

re:claimID OpenID Connect performance improvements

   reclaimID is a decentralized identity system build on top of the GNU
   Name System. Upon authorization, the user provides a requesting party
   (RP) such as a website with an authorization ticket (e.g. piggybacked
   in an OpenID authorization code). The RP uses information contained in
   this ticket to
    1. Retrieve the decryption key from GNS
    2. Retrieve the user attributes from GNS

   The GNS lookups ensure that the RP receives up-to-date attributes and
   functional decryption keys. However, in particular the RP-specific
   encryption key resolution can be slow and even fail depending on the
   network topology. We propose that in an initial exchange, in particular
   OpenID authorization code flows, we try to incorporate key and maybe
   even an attribute set in the ticket exchange. In order to mitigate this
   issue, this project is meant to investigate and implement how...
    1. ... decryption keys can be added to an initial exchange in OpenID.
    2. ... initial set(s) of attributes can be piggybacked in OpenID.

re:claimID alternative GNS-based encryption

   re:claimID is a decentralized identity system build on top of the GNU
   Name System. The initial design and implementation of re:claimID
   includes an attribute-based encryption module in order to prevent
   unauthorized access to attributes in the name system. Our motivation
   for re:claimID was for it to be name system agnostic, which means the
   design theoretically also works for other name systems such as
   namecoin. Other name systems often do not have built-in mechanisms in
   order to do this. Hence, we implemented an ABE access control layer.
   Our ABE implementation requires two third party libraries: libpbc and
   libgabe. While we could merge libgabe into the gnunet service
   implementation of re:claimID, libpbc is a rather large, third party
   library which lacks packaging in distributions and for platforms. On
   the other hand, GNS supports record data encryption using symmetric
   keys as labels. If we make the access control layer of re:claimID more
   generic in order to support both ABE and GNS encryption, we could
   reduce the required depenencies. This would result in gnunet packages
   to include re:claimID by default. In short, the goals are to...
    1. ... improve performance by reducing encryption overhead.
    2. ... reduce dependencies.

Enable all networking applications to run over GNUnet out of the box

   One great problem of the current Internet is the lack of
   disintermediation. When people want to talk they need a chat service.
   When they want to share files they need a file transfer service.
   Although GNUnet already possesses quite advanced integration into Linux
   networking, a little extra work is needed for existing applications
   like irc, www, ftp, rsh, nntpd to run over it in a peer-to-peer way,
   simply by using a GNS hostname like friend.gnu. Once people have added
   a person to their GNS they can immediately message, exchange files and
   suchlike directly, with nothing but the GNUnet in the middle, using
   applications that have been distributed with unix systems ever since
   the 1980's. We can produce an OS distribution where these things work
   out of the box with the nicknames of people instead of cloud services.
   For more information and context, read bug id 4625.
