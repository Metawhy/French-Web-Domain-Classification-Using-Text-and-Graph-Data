   Visit the Walnut Tree Inn at Blisworth near Northampton and find out
   for yourself how we blend the best elements of traditional hospitality
   and service with a contemporary vision and flair that is all our own!

   a one-of a-kind hotel, bar and function destination. But it’s your
   opinion that really matters, so we hope that it won’t be too long
   before you pay us a visit.
