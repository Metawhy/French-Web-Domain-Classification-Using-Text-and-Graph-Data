Select, generate and explore

   The Leiden Ranking enables you to select sophisticated bibliometric
   indicators, to generate results based on these indicators and to
   explore the results from three different perspectives. Best known is
   the traditional list view, in which you can rank universities according
   to a selected indicator. The Leiden Ranking offers two additional
   perspectives: the chart view and the map view. The chart view shows
   universities in a scatter plot, so that you can explore the performance
   of universities using two selected indicators. The map view shows
   universities in a world map and provides a geographical perspective on
   universities and their performance.

Multidimensional perspective

   The Leiden Ranking stands for a multidimensional perspective on
   university performance. Our principles for responsible use of
   university rankings explain why this is crucial. It is up to you to
   select the indicator that you wish to use to rank universities. The
   Leiden Ranking provides indicators of scientific impact, collaboration,
   open access publishing, and gender diversity. Size matters when
   comparing universities: performance can be viewed from an absolute or a
   relative perspective (e.g., the number versus the percentage of highly
   cited publications). That is why size-dependent and size-independent
   indicators are consistently presented together in the Leiden Ranking.
   This highlights that both types of indicators need to be taken into
   account.

A unique ranking

   Compared with other university rankings, the Leiden Ranking offers more
   advanced bibliometric indicators. The underlying methodology is richly
   documented. The Leiden Ranking provides information exclusively about
   the research done at universities. Research is represented in
   publications, and carefully collected data about these publications
   forms the basis for the Leiden Ranking. This basis also ensures the
   independence of the Leiden Ranking, since there is no reliance on data
   submitted by the universities themselves. Finally, because universities
   are complex institutions that have a variety of forms, contexts and
   missions, their performance cannot be represented by a single number.
   The Leiden Ranking presents a variety of indicators for you to explore
   the performance of universities from different angles.
