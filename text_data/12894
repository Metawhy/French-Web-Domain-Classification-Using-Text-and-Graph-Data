   The federal government has ruled out blocking access to mainstream
   social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter despite its
   crackdown on websites hosting violent material or terrorism content.

   The Christchurch terror attack in March sparked a global backlash after
   live footage from the accused gunman's massacre spread online.

   measures to block terror content.

   In response, the Morrison government set up a taskforce to establish a
   framework for blocking violent content during future crises.

   On Sunday the government accepted a recommendation to empower internet
   service providers and telecommunications companies to block specific
   websites hosting terrorist material.

   But federal Communications Minister Paul Fletcher said major social
   media platforms were not the target of the measures to prevent the
   spread of graphic material.

   "Rather, the new blocking arrangements would give telcos the legal
   backing to address fringe websites that wilfully host abhorrent violent
   material and refuse to engage constructively with government," a
   spokesman for Mr Fletcher said.

   The Minister said the new powers had "a very high threshold" before it
   would be used, but he declined to say which websites would be targeted.

   "I don’t want to be naming individual websites, not least because I
   don’t want to be giving them any publicity," he said.

   Australia's eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, said the new
   powers will be applied "on a case- by-case basis".

   "Any such power will be exercised with great discretion and will target
   those sites that are not actively cooperating or removing the content,"
   she said.

   Nigel Phair, director of the UNSW Canberra Cyber centre, said blocking
   websites won't fix the problem and "should be a last resort".

   "If an internet service provider decides to block something from view,
   80 per cent of people won’t see it," he said. "There’s always a way
   around it, but that should not dissuade us."

   He said social media platforms should do more to combat terror content.

   "They’ve got the algorithms to target us with advertisements, [so]
   they’ve got to have the algorithms to stop us seeing this content. I’d
   like to see them invest more in blocking accounts of people who share
   it.

   "If Facebook don’t start doing more to combat this stuff, there will be
   a tipping point and people will stop using social media because it will
   stop being a good user experience."

   The new protocol also includes a round-the-clock crisis coordination
   centre to notify government agencies of online crisis events involving
   terrorism.

   Prime Minister Scott Morrison will this week try to push countries
   further on taking action against terrorist and violent extremist
   material on social media during a series of meetings on the sidelines
   of the G7 summit in France.

   The government has already enacted laws making it a criminal offence
   for companies that do not take down videos showing abhorrent violent
   content.

Concerns persist over long-term impact of cloud seeding in Kosciuszko

   For centuries mankind has dreamed of changing the weather at will, to
   reverse drought, stave off destructive storms or to water crops.

   Climate change aside, most of those attempts have been little more than
   wishful thinking. But when the snow begins to fall in Kosciuszko
   National Park in a few short months time, it will be getting a helping
   hand – from a utilities company.

   Officials with electricity generator Snowy Hydro are installing a
   series of burners along the western edge of Kosciusko national park.
   Those burners are part of a large network of equipment and expertise
   the company plans to use to increase the amount of snow falling in the
   NSW alps this winter.

   With more than 10 years of scientific trials complete, the company has
   been given the green light by the NSW Government to conduct regular
   cloud seeding operations, a move that has some environmentalists
   worried, despite the strict operating restrictions placed on the
   program.

   Snowy Hydro manager of scientific services Karen Kemsley says while
   there has been much debate in the past about whether cloud seeding
   actually works, the extensive trials have proven the company can
   increase the amount of snow falling by about 14 per cent by targeting
   the right clouds as they pass overhead.

   "It's not that we're actually making it snow, because we're only
   allowed to cloud seed into clouds that were going to snow anyway. What
   we're doing is squeezing a little extra out of those clouds."

   Experiments with increasing rain or snow date back to the 1940s, when
   American scientists working for General Electric discovered that
   dropping dry ice into a box containing chilled water vapour caused ice
   crystals to form.

   Atmospheric tests soon followed with mixed success, as planes loaded
   with dry ice were flown into clouds to release their payloads.

   Initial excitement about the potential for the technology to be used as
   a drought-breaker soon followed, and regions around the globe, from
   Russia to Asia, began to roll out large-scale cloud-seeding programs
   either to create rain, or to try and prevent it.

   Rumours have long persisted that the Americans, one of the most
   enthusiastic adopters of the technology, also invested heavily in
   research during the Cold War era into weaponising the weather so it
   could be used to direct destructive storms over hostile territory.

   While little evidence exists to support the conspiracy theories, the US
   did use cloud seeding for military purposes during the Vietnam War,
   according to The New York Times.

   In July 1972 legendary journalist Seymour Hersh reported that the US
   had been conducting a highly classified cloud-seeding program known as
   Operation Popeye on a massive scale over North Vietnam, Laos and South
   Vietnam to increase and control rainfall. By dumping silver iodide and
   lead iodide into clouds, the Americans were reportedly able to extend
   the monsoon season by more than a month over the Ho Chi Minh Trail,
   softening roads to cause disruption to military trucks using the area.

   China too, has been one of the most enthusiastic adopters of weather
   modification. The world was given a glimpse of that enthusiasm in the
   lead-up to the 2008 Olympics when Beijing's Weather Modification Office
   launched a barrage of 1100 rockets containing silver iodide into the
   sky from 21 sites across the city the day before the opening ceremony
   to disperse clouds and keep the event rain-free. China has high hopes
   the technology will help alleviate drought in the country's north.

   China reportedly employs about 50,000 people in various cloud seeding
   programs and hopes to generate up to 55 billion metric tons of
   artificial rain a year. There are even private companies in some
   countries offering a service to brides that claim to be able to seed
   clouds to ensure it doesn't rain on the wedding day.

   While Australia's programs have not been as ambitious as the Chinese,
   the country has also long dabbled with cloud seeding, investing
   significantly in studies run by the CSIRO and others since the 1940s.

   Promising results in the 1960s and '70s led Hydro Tasmania to set up a
   cloud seeding program which last year resulted in 30 cloud seeding
   flights over the island state's water catchments. There have also been
   trials of warm cloud seeding (a different technology to that used in
   NSW) over Queensland and other parts of the country in recent years.

   Victoria, along with NSW and Tasmania, is regarded as one of the few
   locations in the country where cold cloud seeding is potentially
   viable, due to its weather and geography. According to the Department
   of Sustainability and Environment, a number of cloud seeding trials
   have been conducted in the state, including over the Thomson catchment
   from 1988-1992, that it was hoped would boost water storage levels.

   In 2008 the Victorian state government issued a paper announcing it had
   decided against pursing the technology any further, citing ongoing
   uncertainties about the efficacy of cloud seeding and its commercial
   viability, although the paper said authorities would watch with
   interest results from other states and continued advances in the
   technology.

   In NSW, attempts to bring cloud seeding back to the high country after
   some ambiguous early experiment results began in earnest in 2004 with
   the start of the Snowy Precipitation Enhancement Research Project.
   Initial trials were extended to 2014, but the program was given an
   early go ahead in 2013 when the NSW Parliament fast tracked its
   approval, citing overwhelming evidence of its success and scientific
   findings that it did not harm the environment.

   The Snowy Mountains operation is limited to ground based generators
   that target cold fronts sweeping over from the west during the colder
   months and can only operate under specific weather conditions. Smallish
   green sheds with a short tower on their side mix silver iodide with a
   solvent and spray them into a gas burner. Winds sweeping up the side of
   the mountains carries the seeding agent into the clouds.

   In the winter of 2013 Snowy Hydro spent 106 hours burning nearly 45
   kilograms of silver iodide into passing clouds, and a further 68 hours
   during the winter of 2014.

   This year, the network of 23 cloud seeding generators are again being
   positioned along the western edge of the park, and will be ignited when
   clouds likely to produce snow down to 1400 metres pass overhead.

   Kemsley says unlike during the trials, they will be using every
   available opportunity to get the maximum amount of extra precipitation
   out of the passing cold fronts.

   "One of the biggest concerns that people have raised in the past has
   been environmental concerns.

   "But we have strict environmental management plans that we have to
   report to government that impose a lot of requirements on us."

   Those reports have to date found no elevated levels of silver iodide in
   or downwind of the 2100sq km target area, and no evidence that
   increased amounts of snow were having a negative impact on wildlife or
   plants in the park.

   The studies have also dismissed concerns that taking extra moisture out
   of clouds in one location may rob those downwind of rain.

   But some, including NSW Greens MP Mehreen Faruqi, remain wary of the
   program.

   In the latest National Resources Commission report into the trial
   released in 2010, the authors raised concern that there was not enough
   information on what happened to the cloud seeding agents once they were
   dispersed.

   "Although no adverse environmental effects have been detected to date,
   it is an important matter for future risk analysis to understand the
   ultimate fate of these seeding chemicals," the report said.

   Dr Faruqi says the program should never have been allowed to move out
   of the trial phase before answering those concerns.

   "There is nothing to tell us how those chemicals accumulates in the
   environment. We are worried about those chemicals entering the food
   chain of critically endangered animals like the pygmy possum and the
   corroboree frog.

   "When we don't know longer term impacts we have to take a precautionary
   approach, not just 10 years. We have to learn our lessons from the
   past, things like DDT, asbestos, CFCs, the impact of these chemicals
   accumulating became apparent decades after they started being used."

   Dr Faruqi believes that rather than try to alter natural weather
   patterns to create energy, the focus should be shifted to
   well-established alternatives like solar and wind power that do not
   require tampering with the environment's natural cycles.

   Snowy Hydro senior atmospheric scientist Andrew Peace says in the
   overall scale of the winter weather systems of the region, cloud
   seeding plays a relatively small role.

   "We get accused of some interesting things like chemtrails (chemical or
   biological agents believedly sprayed into the atmosphere for sinister
   purposes) but the scope of where cloud seeding can be used is fairly
   limited, basically just where it is used now in NSW, Tasmania, and also
   parts of Victoria."

   One of the biggest problems cloud seeding advocates have faced, is
   proving that the recorded snow wouldn't have fallen naturally anyway.

   In 2010 researchers at Tel Aviv university examined over 50 years of
   data on cloud seeding and concluded that in most cases, measured
   increases in precipitation could be explained by changes in weather
   patterns, rather than direct intervention by cloud seeding. The notable
   exception to their findings was in places where extra rain could be
   coaxed out of orographic clouds formed by air being pushed up over
   mountains – as happens in the Snowy Mountains.

   Under the operating conditions imposed on Snowy Hydro, scientists are
   only allowed to target clouds likely to produce snow down to 1400
   metres, making it difficult to determine how much would have fallen
   without human intervention.

   Elaborate wind fences have been set up around measuring stations and
   trials deliberately left some clouds unseeded to measure the difference
   between those that had been targeted. Operators measuring snowfalls
   were also kept in the dark about when clouds were seeded as part of
   blind tests.

   Despite the confidence scientists involved with the program have in the
   14 per cent increase figure they have arrived at, just how much extra
   water is produced (and more importantly for Snowy Hydro how much money
   can be earned sending that water through its turbines) remains a
   difficult question to answer.

   "There are many things to consider, for example, how much and where the
   snow has fallen, how much snow evaporates, melts or replenishes
   groundwater storage," says Kemsley.

   Then deputy Premier Andrew Stoner was less conservative with his
   figures when making a case to the NSW Parliament in 2012 for allowing
   the program to move from its trial phase.

   "The additional amount of electricity is estimated at 36 gigawatts per
   annum which, if produced by a NSW coal plant, would emit the equivalent
   of over 28,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually and burn
   more than 12,000 tonnes of black coal."

   Figures provided to Mr Stoner's office also predicted the move to full
   operation would lead to an extra 20 gigalitres of water being produced
   every year.

   And while the ski resorts and downstream irrigators welcome any
   increase in precipitation, Snowy Hydro still can't say exactly what the
   program costs, or how much money they make out of it.

   "It's something that we're still working on. I guess the answer is we
   wouldn't be doing it if it wasn't (profitable)," says Kemsley.

   And while the trial has been deemed a success, Kemsley says it is
   important people understand the scale of the operation and that it is
   not going to guarantee a bumper ski season or solve the next 10-year
   drought.

   "It's more an incremental effect, it's obviously boosting the snow
   pack, but it's not doubling it.

   "What you try and do is seed when there are ample opportunities so you
   augment water supplies so there is extra storage to use during
   droughts, you can't create clouds when there's a drought on."

   Barring major changes to the weather that would make the technology
   unviable, Kemsley expects cloud seeding to be a part of the long-term
   management of water storages in Kosciuszko region.

   "The plan is to keep going as we are, because of the results we've had
   from the trial. I think it's a testament to Snowy that it has been a
   project with an innovative vision, with all the spin-off research
   projects that have come out of it, it has been a great achievement that
   I hope keeps going."

How climate change could affect the way we exercise

   The extreme changes of weather recently – from a seemingly endless
   heatwave to seemingly endless rain – affect more than the environment;
   they also affect the way we move.

   For months it has often felt too hot or too wet to exercise. Long walks
   and runs have been replaced by cabin fever, indoor yoga classes and
   finally trying out some of the new livestream fitness classes you can
   do from your lounge (some Australian ones worth checking out include
   Varlah, Voome, Yogaholics and The Robards Method).

   But, generally, for many of us during times of extreme weather
   conditions, we simply become more sedentary, exchanging the walk to
   work with the car or swapping the bicycle for the bus. Whether it's
   lethargy from heat or an instinct to bunker down from the wet, we sit
   more and do less.

   If we do that for too long, there is an impact on our health.

   "At a physiological level, too little exercise can produce costly
   health outcomes like obesity, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and
   insufficient physical activity is a leading cause of death in the
   United States [it is the fourth-leading cause of death worldwide and
   the second biggest contributor to cancer in Australia]," say the
   authors of a new study, published in Nature Human Behaviour.

   "Sedentary lifestyles are also associated with psychological concerns
   such as impaired cognitive performance and a greater risk of clinical
   depression and anxiety. Human well-being clearly suffers from
   insufficient physical activity. Yet even in spite of its substantial
   benefits, people in many countries participate in below-recommended
   levels of physical activity and are becoming increasingly sedentary."

   About 70 per cent of Australian adults are sedentary. Our modern work
   lifestyles and the mechanisation of our lives have been engineered to
   minimise movement, and the environment we live in also plays its part
   in shaping our behaviour.

   "Of the environmental factors affecting physical activity rates,
   temperature plays a noteworthy role," say authors Nick Obradovich and
   James Fowler from Harvard. "When it is too cold or too hot, adults
   perform less physical activity, resulting in more sedentary lifestyles.
   This reduction is mostly due to the nature of adult physical activity:
   the vast majority of exercise-related physical activity occurs
   outdoors. When it is too cold or to hot to go outdoors – for a walk, a
   jog, or to garden – many simply forgo physical activity entirely."

   With the world's leading scientists anticipating increasingly extreme
   fluctuations in the weather as a result of climate change, Obradovich
   and Fowler wanted to understand the impact this might have on the way
   we move.

   They took data showing the recreational physical activity from more
   than 1.9 million Americans between 2002 and 2012, measured it against
   daily weather data over the same period and then made forecasts based
   on climate change projections over the next 30 to 80 years.

   They found that peak physical activity was typically around 28 degrees
   Celsius and that 80 per cent of the temperature ranges between 2002 and
   2012 fell below that. They also found that hot weather had the most
   negative effect on the obese and the elderly who were respectively
   seven times and four times less likely to be physically active.

   As climate change leads to warmer weather in years to come, they said
   "our results suggest that the physical activity rates of both obese and
   elderly individuals may be most susceptible to higher ambient
   temperatures".

   In general, however, they anticipate that warmer weather across the
   year means "in both our city-level and geographic forecasts, we predict
   that much of the United States will experience increased physical
   activity due to future climatic changes".

   It is likely to be a different story for Australians. In America, the
   average temperatures range between about 8 and 18.2 degrees.

   In NSW, the average temperatures range between about 16 and 26 degrees,
   while in Victoria the maximum average ranges between 14.2 and 25.3.

   Leading scientists advise climate change will cause increases to the
   frequency and intensity of extreme weather events in Australia, with
   many more extreme heat days of over 35 degrees Celsius by 2070.

   Obradovich and Fowler took this into account, noting that "our data are
   restricted to observations from one country with a temperate climate".

   "It is critical to repeat this analysis where possible in countries
   with warmer average climates and lower prevalence of airconditioning,
   as they may see net reductions in physical activity due to climate
   change," they add.

   "Ultimately, most of the social impacts of climate change are likely to
   be negative," Obradovich and Fowler conclude.

   "Climate change may reduce economic output, amplify rates of conflict,
   produce psychological distress, increase exposure to the social effects
   of drought and increase heat-related mortality and morbidity, among
   other illnesses. However, climatic changes are unlikely to be uniformly
   costly to society, and it is important to investigate both costs and
   benefits. Here we uncover a possible beneficial effect of climate
   change for the United States...

   "The more we know about the full range of potential climate impacts,
   the better we will be able to prepare for what is likely to be
   humanity's greatest challenge in the 21st century."

'Case-by-case': Minister rules out blocking Facebook amid terror content
crackdown

By Josh Dye

   The federal government has ruled out blocking access to mainstream
   social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter despite its
   crackdown on websites hosting violent material or terrorism content.

   The Christchurch terror attack in March sparked a global backlash after
   live footage from the accused gunman's massacre spread online.
   Social media platforms will be exempt from the government's new
   measures to block terror content.

   In response, the Morrison government set up a taskforce to establish a
   framework for blocking violent content during future crises.

   On Sunday the government accepted a recommendation to empower internet
   service providers and telecommunications companies to block specific
   websites hosting terrorist material.

   But federal Communications Minister Paul Fletcher said major social
   media platforms were not the target of the measures to prevent the
   spread of graphic material.

   "Rather, the new blocking arrangements would give telcos the legal
   backing to address fringe websites that wilfully host abhorrent violent
   material and refuse to engage constructively with government," a
   spokesman for Mr Fletcher said.

   The Minister said the new powers had "a very high threshold" before it
   would be used, but he declined to say which websites would be targeted.

   "I don’t want to be naming individual websites, not least because I
   don’t want to be giving them any publicity," he said.

   Australia's eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, said the new
   powers will be applied "on a case- by-case basis".

   "Any such power will be exercised with great discretion and will target
   those sites that are not actively cooperating or removing the content,"
   she said.
   Loading

   Nigel Phair, director of the UNSW Canberra Cyber centre, said blocking
   websites won't fix the problem and "should be a last resort".

   "If an internet service provider decides to block something from view,
   80 per cent of people won’t see it," he said. "There’s always a way
   around it, but that should not dissuade us."

   He said social media platforms should do more to combat terror content.

   "They’ve got the algorithms to target us with advertisements, [so]
   they’ve got to have the algorithms to stop us seeing this content. I’d
   like to see them invest more in blocking accounts of people who share
   it.
   Loading

   "If Facebook don’t start doing more to combat this stuff, there will be
   a tipping point and people will stop using social media because it will
   stop being a good user experience."

   The new protocol also includes a round-the-clock crisis coordination
   centre to notify government agencies of online crisis events involving
   terrorism.

   Prime Minister Scott Morrison will this week try to push countries
   further on taking action against terrorist and violent extremist
   material on social media during a series of meetings on the sidelines
   of the G7 summit in France.

   The government has already enacted laws making it a criminal offence
   for companies that do not take down videos showing abhorrent violent
   content.

   For centuries mankind has dreamed of changing the weather at will, to
   reverse drought, stave off destructive storms or to water crops.

   Climate change aside, most of those attempts have been little more than
   wishful thinking. But when the snow begins to fall in Kosciuszko
   National Park in a few short months time, it will be getting a helping
   hand – from a utilities company.

   Officials with electricity generator Snowy Hydro are installing a
   series of burners along the western edge of Kosciusko national park.
   Those burners are part of a large network of equipment and expertise
   the company plans to use to increase the amount of snow falling in the
   NSW alps this winter.

   With more than 10 years of scientific trials complete, the company has
   been given the green light by the NSW Government to conduct regular
   cloud seeding operations, a move that has some environmentalists
   worried, despite the strict operating restrictions placed on the
   program.

   Snowy Hydro manager of scientific services Karen Kemsley says while
   there has been much debate in the past about whether cloud seeding
   actually works, the extensive trials have proven the company can
   increase the amount of snow falling by about 14 per cent by targeting
   the right clouds as they pass overhead.

   "It's not that we're actually making it snow, because we're only
   allowed to cloud seed into clouds that were going to snow anyway. What
   we're doing is squeezing a little extra out of those clouds."

   Experiments with increasing rain or snow date back to the 1940s, when
   American scientists working for General Electric discovered that
   dropping dry ice into a box containing chilled water vapour caused ice
   crystals to form.

   Atmospheric tests soon followed with mixed success, as planes loaded
   with dry ice were flown into clouds to release their payloads.

   Initial excitement about the potential for the technology to be used as
   a drought-breaker soon followed, and regions around the globe, from
   Russia to Asia, began to roll out large-scale cloud-seeding programs
   either to create rain, or to try and prevent it.

   Rumours have long persisted that the Americans, one of the most
   enthusiastic adopters of the technology, also invested heavily in
   research during the Cold War era into weaponising the weather so it
   could be used to direct destructive storms over hostile territory.

   While little evidence exists to support the conspiracy theories, the US
   did use cloud seeding for military purposes during the Vietnam War,
   according to The New York Times.

   In July 1972 legendary journalist Seymour Hersh reported that the US
   had been conducting a highly classified cloud-seeding program known as
   Operation Popeye on a massive scale over North Vietnam, Laos and South
   Vietnam to increase and control rainfall. By dumping silver iodide and
   lead iodide into clouds, the Americans were reportedly able to extend
   the monsoon season by more than a month over the Ho Chi Minh Trail,
   softening roads to cause disruption to military trucks using the area.

   China too, has been one of the most enthusiastic adopters of weather
   modification. The world was given a glimpse of that enthusiasm in the
   lead-up to the 2008 Olympics when Beijing's Weather Modification Office
   launched a barrage of 1100 rockets containing silver iodide into the
   sky from 21 sites across the city the day before the opening ceremony
   to disperse clouds and keep the event rain-free. China has high hopes
   the technology will help alleviate drought in the country's north.

   China reportedly employs about 50,000 people in various cloud seeding
   programs and hopes to generate up to 55 billion metric tons of
   artificial rain a year. There are even private companies in some
   countries offering a service to brides that claim to be able to seed
   clouds to ensure it doesn't rain on the wedding day.

   While Australia's programs have not been as ambitious as the Chinese,
   the country has also long dabbled with cloud seeding, investing
   significantly in studies run by the CSIRO and others since the 1940s.

   Promising results in the 1960s and '70s led Hydro Tasmania to set up a
   cloud seeding program which last year resulted in 30 cloud seeding
   flights over the island state's water catchments. There have also been
   trials of warm cloud seeding (a different technology to that used in
   NSW) over Queensland and other parts of the country in recent years.

   Victoria, along with NSW and Tasmania, is regarded as one of the few
   locations in the country where cold cloud seeding is potentially
   viable, due to its weather and geography. According to the Department
   of Sustainability and Environment, a number of cloud seeding trials
   have been conducted in the state, including over the Thomson catchment
   from 1988-1992, that it was hoped would boost water storage levels.

   In 2008 the Victorian state government issued a paper announcing it had
   decided against pursing the technology any further, citing ongoing
   uncertainties about the efficacy of cloud seeding and its commercial
   viability, although the paper said authorities would watch with
   interest results from other states and continued advances in the
   technology.

   In NSW, attempts to bring cloud seeding back to the high country after
   some ambiguous early experiment results began in earnest in 2004 with
   the start of the Snowy Precipitation Enhancement Research Project.
   Initial trials were extended to 2014, but the program was given an
   early go ahead in 2013 when the NSW Parliament fast tracked its
   approval, citing overwhelming evidence of its success and scientific
   findings that it did not harm the environment.

   The Snowy Mountains operation is limited to ground based generators
   that target cold fronts sweeping over from the west during the colder
   months and can only operate under specific weather conditions. Smallish
   green sheds with a short tower on their side mix silver iodide with a
   solvent and spray them into a gas burner. Winds sweeping up the side of
   the mountains carries the seeding agent into the clouds.

   In the winter of 2013 Snowy Hydro spent 106 hours burning nearly 45
   kilograms of silver iodide into passing clouds, and a further 68 hours
   during the winter of 2014.

   This year, the network of 23 cloud seeding generators are again being
   positioned along the western edge of the park, and will be ignited when
   clouds likely to produce snow down to 1400 metres pass overhead.

   Kemsley says unlike during the trials, they will be using every
   available opportunity to get the maximum amount of extra precipitation
   out of the passing cold fronts.

   "One of the biggest concerns that people have raised in the past has
   been environmental concerns.

   "But we have strict environmental management plans that we have to
   report to government that impose a lot of requirements on us."

   Those reports have to date found no elevated levels of silver iodide in
   or downwind of the 2100sq km target area, and no evidence that
   increased amounts of snow were having a negative impact on wildlife or
   plants in the park.

   The studies have also dismissed concerns that taking extra moisture out
   of clouds in one location may rob those downwind of rain.

   But some, including NSW Greens MP Mehreen Faruqi, remain wary of the
   program.

   In the latest National Resources Commission report into the trial
   released in 2010, the authors raised concern that there was not enough
   information on what happened to the cloud seeding agents once they were
   dispersed.

   "Although no adverse environmental effects have been detected to date,
   it is an important matter for future risk analysis to understand the
   ultimate fate of these seeding chemicals," the report said.

   Dr Faruqi says the program should never have been allowed to move out
   of the trial phase before answering those concerns.

   "There is nothing to tell us how those chemicals accumulates in the
   environment. We are worried about those chemicals entering the food
   chain of critically endangered animals like the pygmy possum and the
   corroboree frog.

   "When we don't know longer term impacts we have to take a precautionary
   approach, not just 10 years. We have to learn our lessons from the
   past, things like DDT, asbestos, CFCs, the impact of these chemicals
   accumulating became apparent decades after they started being used."

   Dr Faruqi believes that rather than try to alter natural weather
   patterns to create energy, the focus should be shifted to
   well-established alternatives like solar and wind power that do not
   require tampering with the environment's natural cycles.

   Snowy Hydro senior atmospheric scientist Andrew Peace says in the
   overall scale of the winter weather systems of the region, cloud
   seeding plays a relatively small role.

   "We get accused of some interesting things like chemtrails (chemical or
   biological agents believedly sprayed into the atmosphere for sinister
   purposes) but the scope of where cloud seeding can be used is fairly
   limited, basically just where it is used now in NSW, Tasmania, and also
   parts of Victoria."

   One of the biggest problems cloud seeding advocates have faced, is
   proving that the recorded snow wouldn't have fallen naturally anyway.

   In 2010 researchers at Tel Aviv university examined over 50 years of
   data on cloud seeding and concluded that in most cases, measured
   increases in precipitation could be explained by changes in weather
   patterns, rather than direct intervention by cloud seeding. The notable
   exception to their findings was in places where extra rain could be
   coaxed out of orographic clouds formed by air being pushed up over
   mountains – as happens in the Snowy Mountains.

   Under the operating conditions imposed on Snowy Hydro, scientists are
   only allowed to target clouds likely to produce snow down to 1400
   metres, making it difficult to determine how much would have fallen
   without human intervention.

   Elaborate wind fences have been set up around measuring stations and
   trials deliberately left some clouds unseeded to measure the difference
   between those that had been targeted. Operators measuring snowfalls
   were also kept in the dark about when clouds were seeded as part of
   blind tests.

   Despite the confidence scientists involved with the program have in the
   14 per cent increase figure they have arrived at, just how much extra
   water is produced (and more importantly for Snowy Hydro how much money
   can be earned sending that water through its turbines) remains a
   difficult question to answer.

   "There are many things to consider, for example, how much and where the
   snow has fallen, how much snow evaporates, melts or replenishes
   groundwater storage," says Kemsley.

   Then deputy Premier Andrew Stoner was less conservative with his
   figures when making a case to the NSW Parliament in 2012 for allowing
   the program to move from its trial phase.

   "The additional amount of electricity is estimated at 36 gigawatts per
   annum which, if produced by a NSW coal plant, would emit the equivalent
   of over 28,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually and burn
   more than 12,000 tonnes of black coal."

   Figures provided to Mr Stoner's office also predicted the move to full
   operation would lead to an extra 20 gigalitres of water being produced
   every year.

   And while the ski resorts and downstream irrigators welcome any
   increase in precipitation, Snowy Hydro still can't say exactly what the
   program costs, or how much money they make out of it.

   "It's something that we're still working on. I guess the answer is we
   wouldn't be doing it if it wasn't (profitable)," says Kemsley.

   And while the trial has been deemed a success, Kemsley says it is
   important people understand the scale of the operation and that it is
   not going to guarantee a bumper ski season or solve the next 10-year
   drought.

   "It's more an incremental effect, it's obviously boosting the snow
   pack, but it's not doubling it.

   "What you try and do is seed when there are ample opportunities so you
   augment water supplies so there is extra storage to use during
   droughts, you can't create clouds when there's a drought on."

   Barring major changes to the weather that would make the technology
   unviable, Kemsley expects cloud seeding to be a part of the long-term
   management of water storages in Kosciuszko region.

   "The plan is to keep going as we are, because of the results we've had
   from the trial. I think it's a testament to Snowy that it has been a
   project with an innovative vision, with all the spin-off research
   projects that have come out of it, it has been a great achievement that
   I hope keeps going."

How climate change could affect the way we exercise

   The extreme changes of weather recently – from a seemingly endless
   heatwave to seemingly endless rain – affect more than the environment;
   they also affect the way we move.

   For months it has often felt too hot or too wet to exercise. Long walks
   and runs have been replaced by cabin fever, indoor yoga classes and
   finally trying out some of the new livestream fitness classes you can
   do from your lounge (some Australian ones worth checking out include
   Varlah, Voome, Yogaholics and The Robards Method).

   But, generally, for many of us during times of extreme weather
   conditions, we simply become more sedentary, exchanging the walk to
   work with the car or swapping the bicycle for the bus. Whether it's
   lethargy from heat or an instinct to bunker down from the wet, we sit
   more and do less.

   If we do that for too long, there is an impact on our health.

   "At a physiological level, too little exercise can produce costly
   health outcomes like obesity, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and
   insufficient physical activity is a leading cause of death in the
   United States [it is the fourth-leading cause of death worldwide and
   the second biggest contributor to cancer in Australia]," say the
   authors of a new study, published in Nature Human Behaviour.

   "Sedentary lifestyles are also associated with psychological concerns
   such as impaired cognitive performance and a greater risk of clinical
   depression and anxiety. Human well-being clearly suffers from
   insufficient physical activity. Yet even in spite of its substantial
   benefits, people in many countries participate in below-recommended
   levels of physical activity and are becoming increasingly sedentary."

   About 70 per cent of Australian adults are sedentary. Our modern work
   lifestyles and the mechanisation of our lives have been engineered to
   minimise movement, and the environment we live in also plays its part
   in shaping our behaviour.

   "Of the environmental factors affecting physical activity rates,
   temperature plays a noteworthy role," say authors Nick Obradovich and
   James Fowler from Harvard. "When it is too cold or too hot, adults
   perform less physical activity, resulting in more sedentary lifestyles.
   This reduction is mostly due to the nature of adult physical activity:
   the vast majority of exercise-related physical activity occurs
   outdoors. When it is too cold or to hot to go outdoors – for a walk, a
   jog, or to garden – many simply forgo physical activity entirely."

   With the world's leading scientists anticipating increasingly extreme
   fluctuations in the weather as a result of climate change, Obradovich
   and Fowler wanted to understand the impact this might have on the way
   we move.

   They took data showing the recreational physical activity from more
   than 1.9 million Americans between 2002 and 2012, measured it against
   daily weather data over the same period and then made forecasts based
   on climate change projections over the next 30 to 80 years.

   They found that peak physical activity was typically around 28 degrees
   Celsius and that 80 per cent of the temperature ranges between 2002 and
   2012 fell below that. They also found that hot weather had the most
   negative effect on the obese and the elderly who were respectively
   seven times and four times less likely to be physically active.

   As climate change leads to warmer weather in years to come, they said
   "our results suggest that the physical activity rates of both obese and
   elderly individuals may be most susceptible to higher ambient
   temperatures".

   In general, however, they anticipate that warmer weather across the
   year means "in both our city-level and geographic forecasts, we predict
   that much of the United States will experience increased physical
   activity due to future climatic changes".

   It is likely to be a different story for Australians. In America, the
   average temperatures range between about 8 and 18.2 degrees.

   In NSW, the average temperatures range between about 16 and 26 degrees,
   while in Victoria the maximum average ranges between 14.2 and 25.3.

   Leading scientists advise climate change will cause increases to the
   frequency and intensity of extreme weather events in Australia, with
   many more extreme heat days of over 35 degrees Celsius by 2070.

   Obradovich and Fowler took this into account, noting that "our data are
   restricted to observations from one country with a temperate climate".

   "It is critical to repeat this analysis where possible in countries
   with warmer average climates and lower prevalence of airconditioning,
   as they may see net reductions in physical activity due to climate
   change," they add.

   "Ultimately, most of the social impacts of climate change are likely to
   be negative," Obradovich and Fowler conclude.

   "Climate change may reduce economic output, amplify rates of conflict,
   produce psychological distress, increase exposure to the social effects
   of drought and increase heat-related mortality and morbidity, among
   other illnesses. However, climatic changes are unlikely to be uniformly
   costly to society, and it is important to investigate both costs and
   benefits. Here we uncover a possible beneficial effect of climate
   change for the United States...

   "The more we know about the full range of potential climate impacts,
   the better we will be able to prepare for what is likely to be
   humanity's greatest challenge in the 21st century."
