   [pixel.gif]

   It's easy to register with TestDEN. You may, however, have some
   concerns about signing up for a program online.

[but_up.gif]

     Does TestDEN ensure my privacy and shopping security?


   TestDEN is committed to providing you with complete privacy, security,
   and confidence when purchasing our programs online. TestDEN offers 100%
   secure transactions using the latest 128-bit Secured Sockets Layers
   (SSL). Before the ordering information you enter is passed across the
   Internet, the information is encrypted. Therefore, your credit card
   number and personal information can only be read by TestDEN. Once we
   have received this information, we will not give or sell your personal
   information to any company or person.
   [but_up.gif]   How do I register?


   We have set up 2 convenient payment options for you -- online
   registration, or Paypal payment registration. All details on how to
   register can be found on our Registration Center page. Here's a quick
   guide to signing up for TestDEN programs on our online registration:
    1. Once you have decided which program(s) you want, click on the Buy
       Now tab located in top navigation bar, or click on the Buy Now
       button in the Student Login area found on each page.
    2. Choose one of the 2 payment options.
    3. An order form with program information will appear.
    4. Select the quantity of programs you want. The prices are in US$ and
       do not include possible taxes.
    5. Enter your customer information. Fill in ALL the fields and click
       on Proceed with Order. Information on this page, including credit
       card, and personal information, is passed via a secure server and
       can only be viewed by TestDEN.
    6. You will then be asked to confirm your order and you will see the
       total for your purchase. Confirm your order and click on Finalize
       Order.
    7. Read the Terms of Purchase agreement and click on "Yes, I accept"
       to complete your order.
    8. Print a copy of your sales statement--your credit card is charged
       at this point. You will receive your password via e-mail.

   [but_up.gif]   I want to sign up by phone or fax?

   If you would rather not sign up online, send us a fax or give us a
   call. Go through the online sign up procedure and print a copy of it.
   Phone us with this information at (604) 353-1507
   Scan and e-mail the registration form to comment@testden.com.
   We will contact you by telephone or e-mail to confirm the order once
   the credit card has been approved.
   [but_up.gif]   How is the TestDEN program delivered to me?

   You will receive your account information --your user name and
   password-- via e-mail. If you have registered and have not received
   your account information, e-mail techteam@testden.com.
   [but_up.gif]   When can I start my TestDEN program?

   Once we have confirmed your credit card number, we will e-mail your
   user name and password. Once you have received this information, you
   can begin the program right away. When you sign up online, this is
   usually done instantaneously.
   [but_up.gif]   When is my credit card charged?

   After you click on the "Yes, I agree" button on the Purchase Agreement,
   you will see a Sales Statement page. At this point, your credit card
   will be charged. If you do not complete the registration or if your
   transaction is stopped at anytime before this summary page, your credit
   card will not be charged.
   [but_up.gif]   Why does ACT360° Media Ltd. show up on my credit card
   statement and not TestDEN?

   When charged, ACT360° Media Ltd. will appear on your credit card
   statement. This is because ACT360° Media Ltd. is the name of the
   company that produces the TestDEN products.
   [but_up.gif]   Is there sales tax when I buy from TestDEN?

   Sales tax applies to TestDEN programs ordered from Canada. If taxes -
   like GST and PST - apply to your order, the amount will automatically
   be calculated and added to your Order Form.
   [but_up.gif]   Can I register without a credit card?

   If you have a Paypal account, we accept funds transferred from your
   bank account or funds from your Paypal balance in addition to credit
   cards (all the instant transfer types Paypal has).
   [but_up.gif]   Can I return my TestDEN program, or receive an
   extension?

   Once a payment transaction is complete, the order is final and you
   cannot return the product. There are no extensions for any TestDEN
   products - you will receive 180 days once you have activated your
   account. To activate your account, you must log-in to your program.

   It's easy to use TOEFL IBT. An unusual browser setting or missing
   plug-in can, however, make the program less than optimal.
   To get the most out of TOEFL IBT, or if you experience some
   difficulties, look for the solution in this questions list.
   [but_up.gif]   I can't seem to access and log-in to my TOEFL IBT
   program. Why?

   It may be due to one of the following reasons:
     * Your User Name or Password is incorrect. Enter your User Name and
       Password exactly as it was delivered to you. Your User Name and
       Password are also case-sensitive. Check to see if the Caps Lock is
       activated on your keyboard. If it is, press the key to turn it off.
     * The Log-In page needs to be refreshed. Close your browser and open
       it again. Visit the TestDEN page and enter your User Name and
       Password again in the Student Login area.
     * Your TOEFL IBT program has not been activated, or is no longer
       active. Your activation period is 180 days from the first time you
       log-in.

   [but_up.gif]   Sometimes the test seems to stop loading. Why?

   The test may seem to stop loading if you have a slow Internet
   connection. There may just be a pause during loading, so wait a few
   minutes and it should continue. If it doesn't continue, check your
   Internet connection or try restarting the test. (You may have to
   re-answer a question on the test.) There is a lot of information that
   we need to send, so sometimes there can be a slight delay in the
   loading time.
   [but_up.gif]   How are my answers for the TOEFL IBT test saved?

   Each answer is automatically saved as you go to the next question. You
   may have to re-do one question if you click the Suspend button before
   preceeding to the next question first. Otherwise there are no worries
   about needing to do questions again if your Internet connection should
   fail.
   [but_up.gif]   How can I check that my computer will work properly with
   TOEFL IBT?

   We have a system check page you will see when you do the test.
   For a computer with a Windows operating system, the minimum
   requirements are
     * Windows 2000
     * Pentium 233-megahertz (MHz) processor or faster (300 MHz is
       recommended)
     * At least 64 megabytes (MB) of RAM (128 MB is recommended)
     * Video adapter and monitor with Super VGA (800 x 600) or higher
       resolution
     * Sound card
     * A headset or speakers along with a microphone
     * Stable broadband Internet connection
     * Internet Explorer 6.0 or higher version, or Firefox 2 or higher
     * Flash 8.0 or higher version

   For a Mac, a G4 system or better is required with Safari 2 or Firefox 2
   or higher installed. A headset or microphone or webcam is needed if
   your Mac does not have a built in webcam. Flash 8.0 or higher is also
   needed.
   [but_up.gif]   How does the money back guarantee work?

   If you completed all of our TOEFL IBT materials yet your TOEFL score
   does not improve, we will issue a refund.

   Using the TestDEN TOEIC Test Prep course is easy. An unusual browser
   setting or missing plug-in, however, can make program less than
   optimal. To get the most from TOEIC, or if you are experiencing some
   difficulties, look for the solution here.
   [but_up.gif]   What do I need to use the TestDEN TOEIC Test Prep
   course?


   We have a system check page you will see when you do TOEIC exams.
   For a computer with a Windows operating system, the minimum
   requirements are
     * Windows 2000
     * Pentium 233-megahertz (MHz) processor or faster (300 MHz is
       recommended)
     * At least 64 megabytes (MB) of RAM (128 MB is recommended)

   your Mac does not have a built in webcam. Flash 8.0 or higher is also
   needed.
   [but_up.gif]   Why can't I hear the audio in the Listening section?


   One or more of the following reasons could be preventing you from
   hearing the audio files:
     * Your hardware may be installed incorrectly. Check to see that the
       soundcard, speakers or headphones, and cables are connected and in
       good operating condition.
     * You do not have Flash. Go to Macromedia's download page for the
       free Flash player.
     * Your Flash player plug-in is corrupt or has a bug. Download the
       latest version of Flash.

   [but_up.gif]   I can't seem to log-in and access my TestDEN TOEIC Test
   Prep Course. Why?


   It may be due to one of the following reasons:
     * Your User Name or Password is incorrect. Enter your User Name and
       Password exactly as it was delivered to you. Your User Name and
       Password are case-sensitive. Check to see if the Caps Lock is
       activated on your keyboard. If it is, press the key to turn it off.
     * The Log-In page needs to be refreshed. Close your browser and open
       it again. Visit the TestDEN page and enter your User Name and
       Password again in the Student Login area.
     * Your TestDEN TOEIC Test Prep Course has not been activated, or is
       no longer active. Your activation period is 180 days from the first
       time you log-in.

   [but_up.gif]   Why do my answers "disappear" when I click on my
   browser's BACK button in the TOEIC Business Trainer?


   You must answer all questions on a page before selecting the SUBMIT
   button. If you miss a question, you will receive the following message:
   You have not answered the following questions: 2, 12, 19. Please use
   your browser's BACK button to return to the questions.
   Sometimes your selected answers "disappear" when you return to the
   question page using the BACK button. This is because of a setting in
   the browser.
   To prevent your answers from "disappearing", change the settings in
   your browser:
   For Internet Explorer:
     * Click Tools on the Menu bar then select Internet Options. The
       Internet Options dialog box appears.
     * On the General page, locate the Temporary Internet Files section.
     * Click the Settings button. The Settings dialog box appears.
     * Click the radio button next to "Every Time You Start Internet
       Explorer."
     * Click OK in the Settings dialog box. Click OK in the Internet
       Options dialog box.

   [but_up.gif]   How does the money back guarantee work?


   If you complete all the TestDEN TOEIC Test Prep materials and your

     To get the most out the Accent Reduction Course, or if you experience
          some difficulties, look for the solution in this questions list.
        [but_up.gif]   Who would benefit from the Accent Reduction Course?

                       English speakers from all backgrounds will benefit:
     * Anyone who wants to improve or lose their accent
     * Perfect for professionals who want more confidence in their
       speaking skills
     * Great for students wanting to excel mmore at school

    Those just starting to learn English will find some concepts harder to
                           understand than more advanced English learners.
                              [but_up.gif]   What does my package include?

                             TestDEN's Accent Reduction Course consists of
     * Instant password giving you access to the online course for 180
       days.
     * Instructional DVD
     * Bonus review and practice book

                                        [but_up.gif]   Do I need a webcam?

   A webcam is not required, but is strongly recommended. A webcam is much
   more effective than a microphone alone when it comes to the interactive
                                                          video exercises.

            We have a system check page you will see when you do the test.
               For a computer with a Windows operating system, the minimum
                                                          requirements are

       resolution
     * Sound card
     * A headset or speakers along with a microphone.
     * Webcam is not required but would be ideal to have for the
       interactive video exercises.
     * Stable broadband Internet connection
     * Internet Explorer 7.0 or higher version, or Firefox 2 or higher
     * Flash 8.0 or higher version

                                                                 For a Mac
     * a G4 system or better is required
