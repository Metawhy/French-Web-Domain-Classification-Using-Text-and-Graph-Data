Me, Myself & Him by Chris Tebbetts. LOOOOOOOOOOOOVE.

   Me, Myself and Him   Here’s a book that you need but don’t know you
   need. Why is that? Because #1 if you’re looking for books containing an
   LGBTQ hero, here’s your book. But not because it’s your typical Coming
   Out. Story. While those are important, we’re past that. We need books
   where the kids […]

The Orphan Band of Springdale by Anne Nesbet a #Cybils middle grade finalist

   The Orphan Band of Springdale by Anne Nesbet So much packed into The
   Orphan Band of Springdale. It covers so many issues yet still manages
   to be a tender, touching story. It’s 1941, and tensions are rising in
   the United States as the Second World War rages in Europe.
   Eleven-year-old Gusta’s life, like the world […]

   Joanne Lew-Vriethoff, who has illustrated a number of SUPER ADORBS
   books like: Love and Beautiful Both of which were uplifting messages

   Let’s celebrate Black History Month with The March Against Fear by Ann
   Bausum I am especially moved by this compelling book today. When it

   Rights Movement, a book comes along that makes you question that fact.

Pink is for Boys by Robb Pearlman, Illustrated by Eda Kaban
       / 0 Comments
       Pink is for Boys     A little guy, who is now a young man, once
       told me, when I complimented him on his blue nail polish that “Blue
       is for everyone” and I never forgot that thought. Why? Because it’s
       true. Colors don’t belong to people. Pink is for Boys is the cutest
       ding dang book I’ve seen all year! I’m not sure when colors began
       as boy or girl colors but I think it’s a ridiculous practice that
       should have ended decades ago. What Pink is for Boys points out is
       that colors are for everyone! The opening illustrations show
       children of all ethnicities wearing pink clothes in…

       feels. if you wanna see my review, click here. It’s so good I just

       Crossover appeals to everyone of every color and every belief
       system. To be sure, I know very little about basketball, but that’s
       not even necessary. Alexander’s descriptions seep into your head

You’ll NEVER be the Same!

       I am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter I LOVE THIS BOOK!! I
       couldn’t love this book any harder if I tried! Sanchez brings out
       alot of sensitive issues in this YA book. Perfect Mexican daughters
       do not go away to college. And they do not move out of their
       parents’ house after high school graduation. Perfect Mexican
       daughters never abandon their family. But Julia is not your perfect
       Mexican daughter. That was Olga’s role. Then a tragic accident on
       the busiest street in Chicago leaves Olga dead and Julia left
       behind to reassemble the shattered pieces of her family. And no one
       seems to acknowledge that Julia is broken, too.…
