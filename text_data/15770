Welcome to loterie farm

   Love to be outdoors connecting with nature? Or are you a daredevil and
   love extreme sports?
   Well, here we have them both! Loterie Farm is a secret hideaway nestled
   in the hillside of Pic Paradis
   on French Saint-Martin where you can wine, dine, climb, hike and glide
   over the treetop canopy.
   It is truly an eco-tourism and gastronomical experience you‚Äôre not
   likely to forget or find elsewhere.

   Sep-Oct 2019 schedule Here is our September and October schedule for
   2019.

   Welcome to our, ‚Äúl‚Äôeaulounge‚Äù pool area.

   We have added new areas here as well as updated our kitchen menu to
   reflect us moving forward.

   Our regular Cabanas are ‚Ç¨190 which include entrance for up to 10
   persons. Also included in the cabana rental is a choice of white or
   ros√© wine

   Our VIP cabana is ‚Ç¨290 which includes entrance for up to 10 persons,
   the choice of white or ros√© wine as well as the private use of the deck
   in front of the cabana, adjacent to the pool which also has 4 daybeds.

   Each additional guest, over the allotted 10 will be welcome at the
   additional charge of ‚Ç¨20 per person.

   We have towels for rent here at ‚Ç¨5 and, if you choose, you can bring
   your own towels.

   New for this season we now have our new Caba√±itas for couples.

   For more information, please see here:

   Daybed Guest:  daybeds are available at ‚Ç¨20 per day per person (does
   not include a towel)

   General Admission:  guests wishing to eat and drink are welcome to join
   us in the upstairs/downstairs designated seating areas where you can
   enjoy our chilled ambiance. There is no entrance fee for our lunch
   guests though if you want to use the pool, you need to register at the
   reception and pay for a daybed, caba√±ita or cabana.

   These fees apply to ALL entrants regardless of age.  Our child policy
   remains the same.

   Feel free to bring your own towel, otherwise, we have towels available
   for rent at ‚Ç¨5 per day.


   What time do we open?
   We open at 9 am here at Loterie Farm, now 7 days a week. Pool area
   opens at 10 am
   It is normally not a great idea to come before that as we have our
   trusted security dog, Gunnar, who may select you for a closer
   inspection.


If you want to brush up on your French, here is a nice little article Post
Irma and about our reconstruction & future goals üòâ
