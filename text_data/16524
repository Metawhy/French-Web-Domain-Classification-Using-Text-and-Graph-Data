   Customer service skills being improved.
   Call Center Agent (Former Employee) –  Doha – April 5, 2016
   Being on this job for almost 2 years is very enjoyable with my
   colleagues and managers on the floor. The management were so cool and
   my officemates are very friendly. The hardest part of the job is when
   the rush hour comes and complaints and follow ups are coming at the
   same time. But the most enjoyable part of the job is the everyday being
   with the officemates you have considered as friends too.
   Pros
   Free foods when sales is high.
   Cons
   Short breaks and the graveyard shift

   productive and busy and fun place
   Service Crew (Former Employee) –  Doha Qatar – October 17, 2015
   A very busy work place but very fun place to all of us. we are
   enthusiastic, energetic and willing to help each other.
   The counter is always crowd of customers but even though does not need
   constant supervision.
   we,my co-workers and managers commented on high levels of accuracy and
   work productivity. I always maintain good customer service relations,
   even under stress. I always seems to know when to ask questions and
   when seek guidance and always ask if im not sure with it.
   Pros
   free lunches

   very nice workplace with very friendly co-worker
   Crew Trainer (Former Employee) –  Doha, QATAR – November 5, 2014
   *We greet and thanking customer always, make sandwich ,cook fries, make
   salads.
   *What I've learned in McDonald is how to control my patience even with
   the good and the craziest customer i encounter.,because it's fast food
   the energy and quick service in given.
   *And for the Management nothing to say but I thank them for guiding
   me,supporting me in my journey and helping me to achieve goals.
   *The hardest part of the the job is when i see my co-workers arguing
   about our job, but me as a crew trainer i need to elaborate and explain
   the details and off-course make all of my people be a team all the
   times.
   *The most enjoyable part is when all the hard-works of our team gained
   a successful results of the restaurant,not only for the people but also
   the achievements we are receiving by our supervisor because of the
   great teamwork.

   Swing Manager (Current Employee) –  Doha, DAW – July 24, 2014
   i am very enjoying working in Mc Donalds, i have a career growth ing
   this industry, i've learned so much things here, such as proper and
   standard procedures. all the managers are very active, they also open
   to our suggestion, they all have proper communication in every
   employee. here in Qatar there are different natonalities working in Mc
   Donalds, but it doesnt mean that they cannot communicate properly,,
   most of the crew here are willing to learn and can easily to get along.
   the hardest part of the job is sometimes you need to extend long hours
   of duty, but it is included in the contract that we signed.
   the most enjoyable is we are learning while working, we also have crew
   meetings, outings which we can enjoy a lot.

   forever young working in mcdonalds
   1st Assistant Manager (Current Employee) –  Doha, DAW – March 23, 2014
   It is very happy atmosphere working in fast food company. It will give
   you challenge in your day to day life. Stress, pressure in daily
   operations yet dealing with different kind of people will help you
   improve your self more than what you expected. Hardest part in my job
   was that your whole life was a part of this job because for me even i
   am not physically in the operation, mentally my mind occupies half of
   what was happening inside the restaurant. I cant help but think
   everything need to accomplish on the next day . Working with different
   nationalities makes me much more better than who i was before and I'm
   Lovi'n it.

   Fun workplace but a little bit pressured
   2nd Assistant Manager (Current Employee) –  CITY CENTER BRANCH,DOHA
   QATAR – November 4, 2013
   Everyday is a new learning in handling the shift and dealing with co
   managers and staff, having teamwork and effective communication makes
   the store operation smooth. It's hard when there are days that we don't
   have enough staff because they cannot report to work specially during
   rush days that we knows we will exceed the sales target for the day but
   it's still enjoyable specially we meet different kinds of customer, it
   feels different when i see that we give the best service to our
   customer and we meet their expectations. It is really a big challenge
   to manage a restaurant like McDonald's but this challenge makes us grow
   in dealing and motivating people and achieving objectives/goals.
   Pros
   free food, free transportation and accommodation

   Accounts Assistant (Current Employee) –  Doha, Qatar – August 17, 2013
   Every day at the work place is a challenge despite of having a

   Department. Being one of the chosen few to handle the accounts of the
   company entails a lot of responsibility while trying to maintain
   work-live balance.

   A very challenging and pressured work environment
   Restaurant manager (Current Employee) –  Doha, Qatar – May 21, 2013
   We start work by making checklists as preparation with regards to
   people, equipment and products we serve one hour before opening.
   I have learned the impact of good people skills in the realization of
   your targets, the impact of quality,cleanliness, service and
   hospitality in customer satisfaction and recovery. The management here
   are strict and consistent in implementation of policies. The most
   hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers because of
   the language and the excess hours at work which can't be avoided. Most
   enjoyable is the training and celebration of achievements.
   Pros
   Training and Recognition of achievements
