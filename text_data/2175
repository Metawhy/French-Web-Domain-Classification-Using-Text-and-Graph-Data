SpringerOpen

   The SpringerOpen portfolio has grown tremendously since its launch in
   2010, so that we now offer researchers from all areas of science,
   technology, medicine, the humanities and social sciences a place to
   publish open access in journals and books. Publishing with SpringerOpen
   makes your work freely available online for everyone, immediately upon
   publication, and our high-level peer-review and production processes
   guarantee the quality and reliability of the work.
