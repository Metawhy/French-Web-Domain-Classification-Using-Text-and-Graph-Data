     The transition to a zero carbon economy is inevitable. Now is the
     time for companies to start preparing for a zero carbon future.
     Jill Duggan, Director of The Prince of Wales’s Corporate Leaders
     Group

     This milestone [Paris] Agreement is an important step in ensuring we
     can maintain quality of life on our planet for future generations.
     Neil McArthur, CEO Arcadis

     Now businesses are enabled to work together with governments and
     communities to shape the policies and take the actions necessary to
     transition to a low carbon future.
     Richard Lancaster, CEO of CLP

     We are entering an era of system transformation. Business is already
     playing a leadership role through global collaboration and low
     carbon partnership initiatives to drive innovation and structural
     change.
     Peter Bakker, President of WBCSD

     The global transition to a low-carbon economy is urgent, inevitable,
     and accelerating faster than we ever believed possible.
     Paul Polman, CEO of Unilever and Chairman of the World Business
     Council for Sustainable Development

     We are already not only bending the curve of emissions but actually
     already in a global consensus about the inevitability of the major
     shift that will occur in this century.
     Christiana Figueres

     Investors are interested in our total water stewardship as it is
     directly linked to our business strategy, long-term growth and
     company acceptance.
     Coca-Cola HBC

     In anticipation of changing weather patterns and potential shortages
     of water, we have made water efficiency a key strategic ambition
     shaping our product range.
     Syngenta

     Water risks pose social, environmental and ultimately financial
     risks. Therefore it is obligatory for all sites, affiliates and
     operations to include a water risk assessment within their overall
     risk assessment procedures.
     Roche Holding

     As corporations make an effort to enhance energy productivity there
     will be innovation and development of new technologies that will
     change the way we live and work.
     Anirban Ghosh, CSO, Mahindra Group

     We find that many of our suppliers can reduce their energy
     consumption by 5% or more with basic training and implementation of
     low-cost/no-cost improvement measures.
     Clay Nesler, Vice President for Global Energy & Sustainability at
     Johnson Controls

     Reducing energy consumption will be the primary vehicle in achieving
     our goals. We are very pleased to be the first property company to
     sign up to EP100, ensuring we will increase our energy productivity
     for the benefit of our customers.
     Robert Noel, Chief Executive, Land Securities

     For a company with our global footprint, increasing our energy
     productivity by two-thirds as we have done since 2002 means that we
     are spending over US$100 million less in energy bills each year than
     if our energy productivity had remained constant.
     Clay Nesler, Vice President for Global Energy & Sustainability at
     Johnson Controls

     Going 100% renewable will deliver on our consumer promise to deliver
     brands that are responsibly produced in a world of finite resources.
     Marc Engel, Chief Supply Chain Officer, Unilever

     Climate change is a huge risk to the long-term supply of safe, high
     quality ingredients for Nestlé’s products as crop yields fall and
     production areas shift. We are determined to play our part in taking
     climate action by purchasing renewable electricity.
     Pascal Gréverath, Head of Environmental Sustainability, Nestlé

     Renewable energy plays a key role in achieving our ongoing
     commitment to carbon neutrality, as we aim to use 100% renewable
     energy to meet our global electricity needs by 2020.
     Anthony Cammarata, Managing Director, Goldman Sachs

     Electricity costs are one of the largest components of our operating
     expenses at our data centers, and having a long-term stable cost of
     renewable power provides protection against price swings in energy.
     Urs Hölzle, Senior Vice President, Technical Infrastructure, Google

     By investing in renewables we can not only reduce our emissions but
     also future proof the business.
     Laurel Peacock, Senior Manager of Sustainability, NRG

     We wouldn’t be doing this if it didn’t make business and economic
     sense… It is the way the market is trending and what our customers
     are demanding.
     Laurel Peacock, Senior Manager of Sustainability, NRG

     Our target puts us in a good position vis-à-vis government
     regulation. We are fully compliant with the UK government’s existing
     targets, and would be well placed were they to introduce more
     stringent regulation for companies.
     Tom Byrne, Energy Manager at Land Securities

     We want to know how exposed a particular business is to the changing
     context on climate and what it is practically doing to make the
     changes required; including its targets, timeframes and the extent
     of its ambition.
     Andy Howard, Head of Sustainable Research at Schroders

     By doubling the efficiency of our US fleet [over five years],
     Walmart avoided the emission of nearly 650,000 metric tons of CO²,
     while also saving nearly US$1 billion in the past fiscal year.
     Rob Walton, Walmart

     Ambitious greenhouse gas reduction goals help our teams rally around
     low-carbon innovation. Of course knowing that our goals are backed
     by the current climate research increases buy-in and commitment at
     all levels of the company.
     Alexandra Palt, Chief Sustainability Officer, L’Oreal

     We are working towards building a clean energy future. Expanding the
     share of renewables is key to addressing the chronic energy crisis
     our country is facing today.
     Ramadas Kamath, Executive Vice President and Head – Infrastructure
     and Sustainability, Infosys

     I believe that companies are, above all, agents of transformation.
     We all work at an intersection of economic, political, social and
     environmental dimensions and have either positive or negative
     impacts on all of them.
     Guilherme Leal, B Team Leader and one of the founders of Natura
     Cosméticos

     I spend a lot of my time saying to business leaders, we are citizens
     of the world. We cannot just leave things to the social sector and
     to the politicians to speak up about these climate change issues. We
     have as much clout as they, if not more than some of them, and we
     have the responsibility to speak out. And it makes good business
     sense.
     Richard Branson, Founder, Virgin Group

     …we’re working in partnerships even with our competitors, but also
     with governments and other industries. But to help us get there, we
     need policymakers to play their role. We need them to give us
     certainty. We need them to level out the playing field.
     Hannah Jones, Vice President Sustainable Business & Innovation, Nike

     When it comes to climate change, there is some concern about the
     regulatory policy system. We’re fearful of sudden government
     interaction. Nothing happens for four or five years and suddenly you
     are slammed with a huge regulatory system that you were unprepared
     for. Better to introduce it carefully and voluntarily now – rather
     than have it unleashed upon us.
     Mike Barry, Director of Sustainable Business, Marks & Spencer

     From a policy perspective, General Motors and businesses in general
     look for long-term certainty and clarity. When you get the market,
     the customers, our products and policy all aligned, that’s when you
     can drive true transformation of an industry.
     David Tulauskas, Director Sustainability, General Motors

     Two fiscal policy tools can drive decarbonisation: carbon pricing
     and the end of fossil fuel subsidies. Paying a price for emissions
     while, at the same time, encouraging the activity that causes them
     is perverse.
     Sandrine Dixson-Declève, Director of The Prince of Wales’s Corporate
     Leaders Group

     No CEO would survive if they said climate change is not real
     Mike Bloomberg, Former NYS Mayor

     Moving capital toward a low-carbon economy protects their
     beneficiaries’ returns, and is one of the fastest ways to address
     global warming. Companies take note when investors take action, and
     when money moves, the world moves too.
     Lance Pierce, President of CDP North America

     California’s political and business leaders arrived (in Paris) with
     the clear conviction that climate is not only real, but demands
     action. Our experience offers a wealth of practical lessons for how
     to make rapid, sustainable progress toward the clean energy future.
     Tony Earley, Chairman, CEO and President, PG&E

     Science shows that climate change will reduce food productivity and
     food security at the same time our world’s population is growing and
     requiring us to feed more people with fewer natural resources.
     John Bryant, CEO, Kellogg Company

     As a global food company, we recognize the significant impacts
     climate change can have on our business if left unaddressed.
     Ken Powell, CEO, General Mills

     (Climate change) is absolutely a threat. And that’s why we’re doing
     all that we’re doing today.
     Barry Parkin, CSO, Mars

     I think what we’ve shown already in North Carolina is that when you
     provide the incentives – the investments tax credits for solar; when
     you have the renewable energy portfolio — it works.
     Letitia Webster, Senior Director, VF

     Low-carbon, sustainable investments are key to our future.
     Tom DiNapoli, New York State Comptroller

     We want the underlying companies in our ($300 billion) portfolio to
     be aligned with the transition to a low-carbon global economy.
     Anne Simpson, Global Governance Investment Director, CalPERS

     If you can do one thing for me today, please, never refer to clean
     energy as “alternative energy” again.
     Michael Liebreich, Founder & Chairman of Bloomberg New Energy
     Finance Advisory Board

     Getting to the Paris Agreement was the easy component, it meant
     setting the starting line. Now we have to turn those intentions into
     implemented activities and projects.
     Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary, UNFCCC

     There seems to be a tendency to believe that now that the Paris
     Agreement is done, it is now up to governments. But the real action
     starts now. The business community and civil society need to push
     governments so that they will keep this agreement.
     Ban Ki-Moon, Secretary-General, United Nations

     The once unthinkable has now become unstoppable. This train is
     moving. It started at the Paris station, it has to go and move.
     Ban Ki-Moon, Secretary-General, United Nations

     The entry into force of the Paris Agreement just ten months after
     COP21 is a defining moment for the global economy.
     Paul Polman, CEO of Unilever and Chairman of the World Business
     Council for Sustainable Development

     The global transition to a low-carbon economy is urgent, inevitable,
     and accelerating faster than we ever believed possible.
     Paul Polman, CEO of Unilever and Chairman of the World Business
     Council for Sustainable Development

     We are entering an era of system transformation. Business is already
     playing a leadership role through global collaboration and low
     carbon partnership initiatives to drive innovation and structural
     change.
     Peter Bakker, President of the World Business Council for
     Sustainable Development

     Now businesses are enabled to work together with governments and
     communities to shape the policies and take the actions necessary to
     transition to a low carbon future.
     Richard Lancaster, CEO of CLP

     This milestone Paris Agreement is an important step in ensuring we
     can maintain quality of life on our planet for future generations.
     Neil McArthur, CEO Arcadis

     The significance of the Paris Agreement and its universal impact
     cannot be underestimated. The transition to a zero carbon economy is
     inevitable. Now is the time for companies to start preparing for a
     zero carbon future.
     Jill Duggan, Director of The Prince of Wales’s Corporate Leaders
     Group

     The transition to a zero carbon economy is inevitable. Now is the
     time for companies to start preparing for a zero carbon future.
     Jill Duggan, Director of The Prince of Wales’s Corporate Leaders
     Group

     This milestone [Paris] Agreement is an important step in ensuring we
     can maintain quality of life on our planet for future generations.
     Neil McArthur, CEO Arcadis

     Now businesses are enabled to work together with governments and
     communities to shape the policies and take the actions necessary to
     transition to a low carbon future.
     Richard Lancaster, CEO of CLP

     We are entering an era of system transformation. Business is already
     playing a leadership role through global collaboration and low
     carbon partnership initiatives to drive innovation and structural
     change.
     Peter Bakker, President of WBCSD

     The global transition to a low-carbon economy is urgent, inevitable,
     and accelerating faster than we ever believed possible.
     Paul Polman, CEO of Unilever and Chairman of the World Business
     Council for Sustainable Development

     We are already not only bending the curve of emissions but actually
     already in a global consensus about the inevitability of the major
     shift that will occur in this century.
     Christiana Figueres

     Investors are interested in our total water stewardship as it is
     directly linked to our business strategy, long-term growth and
     company acceptance.
     Coca-Cola HBC

     In anticipation of changing weather patterns and potential shortages
     of water, we have made water efficiency a key strategic ambition
     shaping our product range.
     Syngenta

     Water risks pose social, environmental and ultimately financial
     risks. Therefore it is obligatory for all sites, affiliates and
     operations to include a water risk assessment within their overall
     risk assessment procedures.
     Roche Holding

     As corporations make an effort to enhance energy productivity there
     will be innovation and development of new technologies that will
     change the way we live and work.
     Anirban Ghosh, CSO, Mahindra Group

     We find that many of our suppliers can reduce their energy
     consumption by 5% or more with basic training and implementation of
     low-cost/no-cost improvement measures.
     Clay Nesler, Vice President for Global Energy & Sustainability at
     Johnson Controls

     Reducing energy consumption will be the primary vehicle in achieving
     our goals. We are very pleased to be the first property company to
     sign up to EP100, ensuring we will increase our energy productivity
     for the benefit of our customers.
     Robert Noel, Chief Executive, Land Securities

     For a company with our global footprint, increasing our energy
     productivity by two-thirds as we have done since 2002 means that we
     are spending over US$100 million less in energy bills each year than
     if our energy productivity had remained constant.
     Clay Nesler, Vice President for Global Energy & Sustainability at
     Johnson Controls

     Going 100% renewable will deliver on our consumer promise to deliver
     brands that are responsibly produced in a world of finite resources.
     Marc Engel, Chief Supply Chain Officer, Unilever

     Climate change is a huge risk to the long-term supply of safe, high
     quality ingredients for Nestlé’s products as crop yields fall and
     production areas shift. We are determined to play our part in taking
     climate action by purchasing renewable electricity.
     Pascal Gréverath, Head of Environmental Sustainability, Nestlé

     Renewable energy plays a key role in achieving our ongoing
     commitment to carbon neutrality, as we aim to use 100% renewable
     energy to meet our global electricity needs by 2020.
     Anthony Cammarata, Managing Director, Goldman Sachs

     Electricity costs are one of the largest components of our operating
     expenses at our data centers, and having a long-term stable cost of
     renewable power provides protection against price swings in energy.
     Urs Hölzle, Senior Vice President, Technical Infrastructure, Google

     By investing in renewables we can not only reduce our emissions but
     also future proof the business.
     Laurel Peacock, Senior Manager of Sustainability, NRG

     We wouldn’t be doing this if it didn’t make business and economic
     sense… It is the way the market is trending and what our customers
     are demanding.
     Laurel Peacock, Senior Manager of Sustainability, NRG

     Our target puts us in a good position vis-à-vis government
     regulation. We are fully compliant with the UK government’s existing
     targets, and would be well placed were they to introduce more
     stringent regulation for companies.
     Tom Byrne, Energy Manager at Land Securities

     We want to know how exposed a particular business is to the changing
     context on climate and what it is practically doing to make the
     changes required; including its targets, timeframes and the extent
     of its ambition.
     Andy Howard, Head of Sustainable Research at Schroders

     By doubling the efficiency of our US fleet [over five years],
     Walmart avoided the emission of nearly 650,000 metric tons of CO²,
     while also saving nearly US$1 billion in the past fiscal year.
     Rob Walton, Walmart

     Ambitious greenhouse gas reduction goals help our teams rally around
     low-carbon innovation. Of course knowing that our goals are backed
     by the current climate research increases buy-in and commitment at
     all levels of the company.
     Alexandra Palt, Chief Sustainability Officer, L’Oreal

     We are working towards building a clean energy future. Expanding the
     share of renewables is key to addressing the chronic energy crisis
     our country is facing today.
     Ramadas Kamath, Executive Vice President and Head – Infrastructure
     and Sustainability, Infosys

     I believe that companies are, above all, agents of transformation.
     We all work at an intersection of economic, political, social and
     environmental dimensions and have either positive or negative
     impacts on all of them.
     Guilherme Leal, B Team Leader and one of the founders of Natura
     Cosméticos

     I spend a lot of my time saying to business leaders, we are citizens
     of the world. We cannot just leave things to the social sector and
     to the politicians to speak up about these climate change issues. We
     have as much clout as they, if not more than some of them, and we
     have the responsibility to speak out. And it makes good business
     sense.
     Richard Branson, Founder, Virgin Group

     …we’re working in partnerships even with our competitors, but also
     with governments and other industries. But to help us get there, we
     need policymakers to play their role. We need them to give us
     certainty. We need them to level out the playing field.
     Hannah Jones, Vice President Sustainable Business & Innovation, Nike

     When it comes to climate change, there is some concern about the
     regulatory policy system. We’re fearful of sudden government
     interaction. Nothing happens for four or five years and suddenly you
     are slammed with a huge regulatory system that you were unprepared
     for. Better to introduce it carefully and voluntarily now – rather
     than have it unleashed upon us.
     Mike Barry, Director of Sustainable Business, Marks & Spencer

     From a policy perspective, General Motors and businesses in general
     look for long-term certainty and clarity. When you get the market,
     the customers, our products and policy all aligned, that’s when you
     can drive true transformation of an industry.
     David Tulauskas, Director Sustainability, General Motors

     Two fiscal policy tools can drive decarbonisation: carbon pricing
     and the end of fossil fuel subsidies. Paying a price for emissions
     while, at the same time, encouraging the activity that causes them
     is perverse.
     Sandrine Dixson-Declève, Director of The Prince of Wales’s Corporate
     Leaders Group

     No CEO would survive if they said climate change is not real
     Mike Bloomberg, Former NYS Mayor

     Moving capital toward a low-carbon economy protects their
     beneficiaries’ returns, and is one of the fastest ways to address
     global warming. Companies take note when investors take action, and
     when money moves, the world moves too.
     Lance Pierce, President of CDP North America

     California’s political and business leaders arrived (in Paris) with
     the clear conviction that climate is not only real, but demands
     action. Our experience offers a wealth of practical lessons for how
     to make rapid, sustainable progress toward the clean energy future.
     Tony Earley, Chairman, CEO and President, PG&E

     Science shows that climate change will reduce food productivity and
     food security at the same time our world’s population is growing and
     requiring us to feed more people with fewer natural resources.
     John Bryant, CEO, Kellogg Company

     As a global food company, we recognize the significant impacts
     climate change can have on our business if left unaddressed.
     Ken Powell, CEO, General Mills

     (Climate change) is absolutely a threat. And that’s why we’re doing
     all that we’re doing today.
     Barry Parkin, CSO, Mars

     I think what we’ve shown already in North Carolina is that when you
     provide the incentives – the investments tax credits for solar; when
     you have the renewable energy portfolio — it works.
     Letitia Webster, Senior Director, VF

     Low-carbon, sustainable investments are key to our future.
     Tom DiNapoli, New York State Comptroller

     We want the underlying companies in our ($300 billion) portfolio to
     be aligned with the transition to a low-carbon global economy.
     Anne Simpson, Global Governance Investment Director, CalPERS

     If you can do one thing for me today, please, never refer to clean
     energy as “alternative energy” again.
     Michael Liebreich, Founder & Chairman of Bloomberg New Energy
     Finance Advisory Board

     Getting to the Paris Agreement was the easy component, it meant
     setting the starting line. Now we have to turn those intentions into
     implemented activities and projects.
     Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary, UNFCCC

     There seems to be a tendency to believe that now that the Paris
     Agreement is done, it is now up to governments. But the real action
     starts now. The business community and civil society need to push
     governments so that they will keep this agreement.
     Ban Ki-Moon, Secretary-General, United Nations

     The once unthinkable has now become unstoppable. This train is
     moving. It started at the Paris station, it has to go and move.
     Ban Ki-Moon, Secretary-General, United Nations

     The entry into force of the Paris Agreement just ten months after
     COP21 is a defining moment for the global economy.
     Paul Polman, CEO of Unilever and Chairman of the World Business
     Council for Sustainable Development

     The global transition to a low-carbon economy is urgent, inevitable,
     and accelerating faster than we ever believed possible.
     Paul Polman, CEO of Unilever and Chairman of the World Business
     Council for Sustainable Development

     We are entering an era of system transformation. Business is already
     playing a leadership role through global collaboration and low
     carbon partnership initiatives to drive innovation and structural
     change.
     Peter Bakker, President of the World Business Council for
     Sustainable Development

     Now businesses are enabled to work together with governments and
     communities to shape the policies and take the actions necessary to
     transition to a low carbon future.
     Richard Lancaster, CEO of CLP

     This milestone Paris Agreement is an important step in ensuring we
     can maintain quality of life on our planet for future generations.
     Neil McArthur, CEO Arcadis

     The significance of the Paris Agreement and its universal impact
     cannot be underestimated. The transition to a zero carbon economy is
     inevitable. Now is the time for companies to start preparing for a
     zero carbon future.
     Jill Duggan, Director of The Prince of Wales’s Corporate Leaders
     Group
