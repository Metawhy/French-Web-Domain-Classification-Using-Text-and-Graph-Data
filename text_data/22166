Photography


Did you know you can now see the best of my photos in an online Gallery and
buy any you love?

   I love taking photos and can’t image to travel without the possibility
   of capturing the surrounding me reality. Taking pictures is one of the
   ways I react with Nature, and I always have my camera ready when I
   hike.

   Recently, I’ve created a Gallery and online Store where you can see
   many of my best photos and even buy them as prints, canvas or… your
   soon-to-be favorite tote.

   Take a minute to jump over to my Gallery and who knows? Maybe you will
   find a photo to adore your naked walls :)

Hello, Friend!

   I’m Ioanna aka, A Woman Afoot: a 40+ woman, an educator passionate
   about hiking and camping alone.

   I want to encourage more women - of every shape, color, age or
   sexual/gender identity - to hit the trails. Hiking is not just an
   adventure for straight white guys - it’s for all of us.

   Thank you for your interest in my website. I do my best to provide
   high-quality content that could be helpful for any hikers - beginners
   or experts. I share with you reports from my hiking and camping trips,
   some advice and tips on backpacking, as well as a fair amount of
   musings on mental health, body-acceptance, feminism, women’s rights,
   and similar subjects dear to my heart.

   I hope my articles will give you strength and tools to find your own
   way into the Great Outdoors. Click below to find out why hiking and
   hiking solo is so important to me:
