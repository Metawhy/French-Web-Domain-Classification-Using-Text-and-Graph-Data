The IPCC was created to provide policymakers with regular scientific
assessments on climate change, its implications and potential future risks,
as well as to put forward adaptation and mitigation options.

   Through its assessments, the IPCC determines the state of knowledge on
   climate change. It identifies where there is agreement in the
   scientific community on topics related to climate change, and where
   further research is needed. The reports are drafted and reviewed in
   several stages, thus guaranteeing objectivity and transparency.  The
   IPCC does not conduct its own research.

   IPCC reports are neutral, policy-relevant but not policy-prescriptive.
    The assessment reports are a key input into the international
   negotiations to tackle climate change. Created by the United Nations
   Environment Programme (UN Environment) and the World Meteorological
   Organization (WMO) in 1988, the IPCC  has 195 Member countries. In the
   same year, the UN General Assembly endorsed the action by WMO and UNEP
   in jointly establishing the IPCC.

   The IPCC prepares comprehensive Assessment Reports about the state of
   scientific, technical and socio-economic knowledge on climate change,
   its impacts and future risks, and options for reducing the rate at
   which climate change is taking place. It also produces Special Reports
   on topics agreed to by its member governments, as well as Methodology
   Reports that provide guidelines for the preparation of greenhouse gas
   inventories. Learn more about the reports here.

Activities

   The main activity of the IPCC is the preparation of reports assessing
   the state of knowledge of climate change. These include assessment
   reports, special reports and methodology reports. To deliver this work
   programme, the IPCC holds meetings of its government representatives,
   convening as plenary sessions of the Panel or IPCC Working Groups to
   approve, adopt and accept reports. Plenary Sessions of the IPCC also
   determine the IPCC work programme, and other business including its
   budget and outlines of reports. The IPCC Bureau meets regularly to
   provide guidance to the Panel on scientific and technical aspects of
   its work.

   The IPCC organizes scoping meetings of experts and meetings of lead
   authors to prepare reports. It organizes expert meetings and workshops
   on various topics to support its work programme, and publishes the
   proceedings of these meetings.  To communicate its findings and explain
   its work, the IPCC takes part in outreach activities organized by the
   IPCC or hosted by other organizations, and provides speakers to other
   conferences.

   More information on sessions of the IPCC, its Working Groups and the
   Bureau can be found in the Documentation section.

Working Groups and Task Force

   IPCC assessments and special reports are prepared by three Working
   Groups, each looking at a different aspect of the science related to
   climate change: Working Group I (The Physical Science Basis), Working
   Group II (Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability), and Working Group III
   (Mitigation of Climate Change). The IPCC also has a Task Force on
   National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, whose main objective is to develop
   and refine a methodology for the calculation and reporting of national
   greenhouse gas emissions and removals.

   The Working Groups and Task Force handle the preparation of reports,
   selecting and managing the experts that work on them as authors.

   The activities of each Working Group and the Task Force are supported
   by their Technical Support Units (TSU).

Background

   At its 43rd Session (Nairobi, Kenya, 11 – 13 April 2016), the IPCC
   Panel decided to prepare a special report on climate change,
   desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food
   security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems.

   Experts met on 13 – 17 February 2017 in Dublin, Ireland to prepare a
   draft outline for the report.

   At its 45th Session (Guadalajara, Mexico, 28 – 31 March 2017), the
   Panel approved the outline for Climate Change and Land: an IPCC special
   report on climate change, desertification, land degradation,
   sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes
   in terrestrial ecosystems.

   The Special Report was developed under the joint scientific leadership
   of Working Groups I, II, III in cooperation with the Task Force on
   National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, and supported by the Working Group
   III Technical Support Unit.

Authors and Review Editors

   107 experts from 52 countries were selected as Coordinating Lead
   Authors and Lead Authors – who are working on  each individual chapter
   – and Review Editors, who ensured that comments by experts and
   governments were given appropriate consideration as the report
   developed.

   40% of the Coordinating Lead Authors are women.  53% of the authors are
   from developing countries, making this the first IPCC report to have
   more authors from developing countries than from developed
   countries.  The full list of Coordinating Lead Authors, Lead Authors
   and Review Editors is here.

   A call for nomination of authors was sent to governments, observer
   organizations and IPCC Bureau Members on 5 April 2017. Graphics that
   provide background information about the nominees are available here

Pre-Scoping

   The Steering Committee for the Special Report on climate change,
   desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food
   security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems
   circulated a questionnaire to IPCC Focal Points and Observer
   Organizations ahead of the Scoping Meeting in February 2017 to get
   input on the structure and contents of the report. You can download the
   questionnaire and stakeholder consultation report here.

Scoping

   A scoping meeting for the Special Report on climate change,
   desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food
   security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems was held
   on 13 – 17 February 2017 in Dublin, Ireland. The meeting resulted in
   a draft scoping paper describing the objectives and an annotated
   outline of the Special Report as well as the process and timeline for
   its preparation.

   All the details of the scoping meeting are available in the scoping
   meeting report.

Chapter 1

Executive Summary

   This chapter frames the context, knowledge-base and assessment
   approaches used to understand the impacts of 1.5°C global warming above
   pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission
   pathways, building on the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), in the
   context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate
   change, sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty.

   Human-induced warming reached approximately 1°C (likely between 0.8°C
   and 1.2°C) above pre-industrial levels in 2017, increasing at 0.2°C
   (likely between 0.1°C and 0.3°C) per decade (high confidence). Global
   warming is defined in this report as an increase in combined surface
   air and sea surface temperatures averaged over the globe and over a
   30-year period. Unless otherwise specified, warming is expressed
   relative to the period 1850–1900, used as an approximation of
   pre-industrial temperatures in AR5. For periods shorter than 30 years,
   warming refers to the estimated average temperature over the 30 years
   centred on that shorter period, accounting for the impact of any
   temperature fluctuations or trend within those 30 years. Accordingly,
   warming from pre- industrial levels to the decade 2006–2015 is assessed
   to be 0.87°C (likely between 0.75°C and 0.99°C). Since 2000, the
   estimated level of human-induced warming has been equal to the level of
   observed warming with a likely range of ±20% accounting for uncertainty
   due to contributions from solar and volcanic activity over the
   historical period (high confidence). {1.2.1}

   Warming greater than the global average has already been experienced in
   many regions and seasons, with higher average warming over land than
   over the ocean (high confidence). Most land regions are experiencing
   greater warming than the global average, while most ocean regions are
   warming at a slower rate. Depending on the temperature dataset
   considered, 20–40% of the global human population live in regions that,
   by the decade 2006–2015, had already experienced warming of more than
   1.5°C above pre-industrial in at least one season (medium confidence).
   {1.2.1, 1.2.2}

   Past emissions alone are unlikely to raise global-mean temperature to
   1.5°C above pre-industrial levels (medium confidence), but past
   emissions do commit to other changes, such as further sea level rise
   (high confidence). If all anthropogenic emissions (including
   aerosol-related) were reduced to zero immediately, any further warming
   beyond the 1°C already experienced would likely be less than 0.5°C over
   the next two to three decades (high confidence), and likely less than
   0.5°C on a century time scale (medium confidence), due to the opposing
   effects of different climate processes and drivers. A warming greater
   than 1.5°C is therefore not geophysically unavoidable: whether it will
   occur depends on future rates of emission reductions. {1.2.3, 1.2.4}

   1.5°C emission pathways are defined as those that, given current
   knowledge of the climate response, provide a one- in-two to
   two-in-three chance of warming either remaining below 1.5°C or
   returning to 1.5°C by around 2100 following an overshoot. Overshoot
   pathways are characterized by the peak magnitude of the overshoot,
   which may have implications for impacts. All 1.5°C pathways involve
   limiting cumulative emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases, including
   carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, and substantial reductions in other
   climate forcers (high confidence). Limiting cumulative emissions
   requires either reducing net global emissions of long-lived greenhouse
   gases to zero before the cumulative limit is reached, or net negative
   global emissions (anthropogenic removals) after the limit is exceeded.
   {1.2.3, 1.2.4, Cross-Chapter Boxes 1 and 2}

   This report assesses projected impacts at a global average warming of
   1.5°C and higher levels of warming. Global warming of 1.5°C is
   associated with global average surface temperatures fluctuating
   naturally on either side of 1.5°C, together with warming substantially
   greater than 1.5°C in many regions and seasons (high confidence), all
   of which must be considered in the assessment of impacts. Impacts at
   1.5°C of warming also depend on the emission pathway to 1.5°C. Very
   different impacts result from pathways that remain below 1.5°C versus
   pathways that return to 1.5°C after a substantial overshoot, and when
   temperatures stabilize at 1.5°C versus a transient warming past 1.5°C
   (medium confidence). {1.2.3, 1.3}

   Ethical considerations, and the principle of equity in particular, are
   central to this report, recognizing that many of the impacts of warming
   up to and beyond 1.5°C, and some potential impacts of mitigation
   actions required to limit warming to 1.5°C, fall disproportionately on
   the poor and vulnerable (high confidence). Equity has procedural and
   distributive dimensions and requires fairness in burden sharing both
   between generations and between and within nations. In framing the
   objective of holding the increase in the global average temperature
   rise to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue
   efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C, the Paris Agreement associates the
   principle of equity with the broader goals of poverty eradication and
   sustainable development, recognising that effective responses to
   climate change require a global collective effort that may be guided by
   the 2015 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. {1.1.1}

   Climate adaptation refers to the actions taken to manage impacts of
   climate change by reducing vulnerability and exposure to its harmful
   effects and exploiting any potential benefits. Adaptation takes place
   at international, national and local levels. Subnational jurisdictions
   and entities, including urban and rural municipalities, are key to
   developing and reinforcing measures for reducing weather- and
   climate-related risks. Adaptation implementation faces several barriers
   including lack of up-to-date and locally relevant information, lack of
   finance and technology, social values and attitudes, and institutional
   constraints (high confidence). Adaptation is more likely to contribute
   to sustainable development when policies align with mitigation and
   poverty eradication goals (medium confidence). {1.1, 1.4}

   Ambitious mitigation actions are indispensable to limit warming to
   1.5°C while achieving sustainable development and poverty eradication
   (high confidence). Ill-designed responses, however, could pose
   challenges especially – but not exclusively – for countries and regions
   contending with poverty and those requiring significant transformation
   of their energy systems. This report focuses on ‘climate-resilient
   development pathways’, which aim to meet the goals of sustainable
   development, including climate adaptation and mitigation, poverty
   eradication and reducing inequalities. But any feasible pathway that
   remains within 1.5°C involves synergies and trade-offs (high
   confidence). Significant uncertainty remains as to which pathways are
   more consistent with the principle of equity.
   {1.1.1, 1.4}

   Multiple forms of knowledge, including scientific evidence, narrative
   scenarios and prospective pathways, inform the understanding of 1.5°C.
   This report is informed by traditional evidence of the physical climate
   system and associated impacts and vulnerabilities of climate change,
   together with knowledge drawn from the perceptions of risk and the
   experiences of climate impacts and governance systems. Scenarios and
   pathways are used to explore conditions enabling goal-oriented futures
   while recognizing the significance of ethical considerations, the
   principle of equity, and the societal transformation needed. {1.2.3,
   1.5.2}

   There is no single answer to the question of whether it is feasible to
   limit warming to 1.5°C and adapt to the consequences. Feasibility is
   considered in this report as the capacity of a system as a whole to
   achieve a specific outcome. The global transformation that would be
   needed to limit warming to 1.5°C requires enabling conditions that
   reflect the links, synergies and trade-offs between mitigation,
   adaptation and sustainable development. These enabling conditions are
   assessed across many dimensions of feasibility – geophysical,
   environmental-ecological, technological, economic, socio-cultural and
   institutional – that may be considered through the unifying lens of the
   Anthropocene, acknowledging profound, differential but increasingly
   geologically significant human influences on the Earth system as a
   whole. This framing also emphasises the global interconnectivity of
   past, present and future human–environment relations, highlighting the
   need and opportunities for integrated responses to achieve the goals of
   the Paris Agreement. {1.1, Cross-Chapter Box 1}

Chapter 2

Executive Summary

   This chapter assesses mitigation pathways consistent with limiting
   warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. In doing so, it explores
   the following key questions: What role do CO[2] and non-CO[2] emissions
   play? {2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.6} To what extent do 1.5°C pathways involve
   overshooting and returning below 1.5°C during the 21st century? {2.2,
   2.3} What are the implications for transitions in energy, land use and
   sustainable development? {2.3, 2.4, 2.5} How do policy frameworks
   affect the ability to limit warming to 1.5°C? {2.3, 2.5} What are the
   associated knowledge gaps? {2.6}

   The assessed pathways describe integrated, quantitative evolutions of
   all emissions over the 21st century associated with global energy and
   land use and the world economy. The assessment is contingent upon
   available integrated assessment literature and model assumptions, and
   is complemented by other studies with different scope, for example,
   those focusing on individual sectors. In recent years, integrated
   mitigation studies have improved the characterizations of mitigation
   pathways. However, limitations remain, as climate damages, avoided
   impacts, or societal co-benefits of the modelled transformations remain
   largely unaccounted for, while concurrent rapid technological changes,
   behavioural aspects, and uncertainties about input data present
   continuous challenges. (high confidence) {2.1.3, 2.3, 2.5.1, 2.6,
   Technical Annex 2}
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Chances of Limiting Warming to 1.5°C and the Requirements for
   Urgent Action

   Pathways consistent with 1.5°C of warming above pre-industrial levels
   can be identified under a range of assumptions about economic growth,
   technology developments and lifestyles. However, lack of global
   cooperation, lack of governance of the required energy and land
   transformation, and increases in resource-intensive consumption are key
   impediments to achieving 1.5°C pathways. Governance challenges have
   been related to scenarios with high inequality and high population
   growth in the 1.5°C pathway literature. {2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.5}

   Under emissions in line with current pledges under the Paris Agreement
   (known as Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs), global warming
   is expected to surpass 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, even if these
   pledges are supplemented with very challenging increases in the scale
   and ambition of mitigation after 2030 (high confidence). This increased
   action would need to achieve net zero CO[2] emissions in less than 15
   years. Even if this is achieved, temperatures would only be expected to
   remain below the 1.5°C threshold if the actual geophysical response
   ends up being towards the low end of the currently estimated
   uncertainty range. Transition challenges as well as identified
   trade-offs can be reduced if global emissions peak before 2030 and
   marked emissions reductions compared to today are already achieved by
   2030 {2.2, 2.3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4}.

   Limiting warming to 1.5°C depends on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   over the next decades, where lower GHG emissions in 2030 lead to a
   higher chance of keeping peak warming to 1.5°C (high confidence).
   Available pathways that aim for no or limited (less than 0.1°C)
   overshoot of 1.5°C keep GHG emissions in 2030 to 25–30 GtCO[2]e yr^−1
   in 2030 (interquartile range). This contrasts with median estimates for
   current unconditional NDCs of 52–58 GtCO[2]e yr^−1 in 2030. Pathways
   that aim for limiting warming to 1.5°C by 2100 after a temporary
   temperature overshoot rely on large-scale deployment of carbon dioxide
   removal (CDR) measures, which are uncertain and entail clear risks. In
   model pathways with no or limited overshoot of 1.5°C, global net
   anthropogenic CO[2] emissions decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by
   2030 (40–60% interquartile range), reaching net zero around 2050
   (2045–2055 interquartile range).^1 For limiting global warming to below
   2°C with at least 66% probability CO[2] emissions are projected to
   decline by about 25% by 2030 in most pathways (10–30% interquartile
   range) and reach net zero around 2070 (2065–2080 interquartile range).
   {2.2, 2.3.3, 2.3.5, 2.5.3, Cross-Chapter Boxes 6 in Chapter 3 and 9 in
   Chapter 4, 4.3.7}

   Limiting warming to 1.5°C implies reaching net zero CO[2] emissions
   globally around 2050 and concurrent deep reductions in emissions of
   non-CO[2] forcers, particularly methane (high confidence). Such
   mitigation pathways are characterized by energy-demand reductions,
   decarbonization of electricity and other fuels, electrification of
   energy end use, deep reductions in agricultural emissions, and some
   form of CDR with carbon storage on land or sequestration in geological
   reservoirs. Low energy demand and low demand for land- and
   GHG-intensive consumption goods facilitate limiting warming to as close
   as possible to 1.5°C. {2.2.2, 2.3.1, 2.3.5, 2.5.1, Cross-Chapter Box 9
   in Chapter 4}.

   In comparison to a 2°C limit, the transformations required to limit
   warming to 1.5°C are qualitatively similar but more pronounced and
   rapid over the next decades (high confidence). 1.5°C implies very
   ambitious, internationally cooperative policy environments that
   transform both supply and demand (high confidence). {2.3, 2.4, 2.5}

   Policies reflecting a high price on emissions are necessary in models
   to achieve cost-effective 1.5°C pathways (high confidence). Other
   things being equal, modelling studies suggest the global average
   discounted marginal abatement costs for limiting warming to 1.5°C being
   about 3–4 times higher compared to 2°C over the 21st century, with
   large variations across models and socio-economic and policy
   assumptions. Carbon pricing can be imposed directly or implicitly by
   regulatory policies. Policy instruments, like technology policies or
   performance standards, can complement explicit carbon pricing in
   specific areas. {2.5.1, 2.5.2, 4.4.5}

   Limiting warming to 1.5°C requires a marked shift in investment
   patterns (medium confidence). Additional annual average energy-related
   investments for the period 2016 to 2050 in pathways limiting warming to
   1.5°C compared to pathways without new climate policies beyond those in
   place today (i.e., baseline) are estimated to be around 830 billion
   USD2010 (range of 150 billion to 1700 billion USD2010 across six
   models). Total energy-related investments increase by about 12% (range
   of 3% to 24%) in 1.5°C pathways relative to 2°C pathways. Average
   annual investment in low-carbon energy technologies and energy
   efficiency are upscaled by roughly a factor of six (range of factor of
   4 to 10) by 2050 compared to 2015, overtaking fossil investments
   globally by around 2025 (medium confidence). Uncertainties and
   strategic mitigation portfolio choices affect the magnitude and focus
   of required investments. {2.5.2}
     __________________________________________________________________

   Future Emissions in 1.5°C Pathways

   Mitigation requirements can be quantified using carbon budget
   approaches that relate cumulative CO[2] emissions to global mean
   temperature increase. Robust physical understanding underpins this
   relationship, but uncertainties become increasingly relevant as a
   specific temperature limit is approached. These uncertainties relate to
   the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE),
   non-CO[2] emissions, radiative forcing and response, potential
   additional Earth system feedbacks (such as permafrost thawing), and
   historical emissions and temperature. {2.2.2, 2.6.1}

   Cumulative CO[2] emissions are kept within a budget by reducing global
   annual CO[2] emissions to net zero. This assessment suggests a
   remaining budget of about 420 GtCO[2 ]for a two-thirds chance of
   limiting warming to 1.5°C, and of about 580 GtCO[2] for an even chance
   (medium confidence). The remaining carbon budget is defined here as
   cumulative CO[2] emissions from the start of 2018 until the time of net
   zero global emissions for global warming defined as a change in global
   near-surface air temperatures. Remaining budgets applicable to 2100
   would be approximately 100 GtCO[2] lower than this to account for
   permafrost thawing and potential methane release from wetlands in the
   future, and more thereafter. These estimates come with an additional
   geophysical uncertainty of at least ±400 GtCO[2], related to non-CO[2]
   response and TCRE distribution. Uncertainties in the level of historic
   warming contribute ±250 GtCO[2]. In addition, these estimates can vary
   by ±250 GtCO[2] depending on non-CO[2] mitigation strategies as found
   in available pathways. {2.2.2, 2.6.1}

   Staying within a remaining carbon budget of 580 GtCO[2] implies that
   CO[2] emissions reach carbon neutrality in about 30 years, reduced to
   20 years for a 420 GtCO[2] remaining carbon budget (high confidence).
   The ±400 GtCO[2] geophysical uncertainty range surrounding a carbon
   budget translates into a variation of this timing of carbon neutrality
   of roughly ±15–20 years. If emissions do not start declining in the
   next decade, the point of carbon neutrality would need to be reached at
   least two decades earlier to remain within the same carbon budget.
   {2.2.2, 2.3.5}

   Non-CO[2] emissions contribute to peak warming and thus affect the
   remaining carbon budget. The evolution of methane and sulphur dioxide
   emissions strongly influences the chances of limiting warming to 1.5°C.
   In the near-term, a weakening of aerosol cooling would add to future
   warming, but can be tempered by reductions in methane emissions (high
   confidence). Uncertainty in radiative forcing estimates (particularly
   aerosol) affects carbon budgets and the certainty of pathway
   categorizations. Some non-CO[2] forcers are emitted alongside CO[2],
   particularly in the energy and transport sectors, and can be largely
   addressed through CO[2] mitigation. Others require specific measures,
   for example, to target agricultural nitrous oxide (N[2]O) and methane
   (CH[4]), some sources of black carbon, or hydrofluorocarbons (high
   confidence). In many cases, non-CO[2] emissions reductions are similar
   in 2°C pathways, indicating reductions near their assumed maximum
   potential by integrated assessment models. Emissions of N[2]O and NH[3]
   increase in some pathways with strongly increased bioenergy demand.
   {2.2.2, 2.3.1, 2.4.2, 2.5.3}
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Role of Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR)

   All analysed pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited
   overshoot use CDR to some extent to neutralize emissions from sources
   for which no mitigation measures have been identified and, in most
   cases, also to achieve net negative emissions to return global warming
   to 1.5°C following a peak (high confidence). The longer the delay in
   reducing CO[2] emissions towards zero, the larger the likelihood of
   exceeding 1.5°C, and the heavier the implied reliance on net negative
   emissions after mid-century to return warming to 1.5°C (high
   confidence). The faster reduction of net CO[2] emissions in 1.5°C
   compared to 2°C pathways is predominantly achieved by measures that
   result in less CO[2] being produced and emitted, and only to a smaller
   degree through additional CDR. Limitations on the speed, scale and
   societal acceptability of CDR deployment also limit the conceivable
   extent of temperature overshoot. Limits to our understanding of how the
   carbon cycle responds to net negative emissions increase the
   uncertainty about the effectiveness of CDR to decline temperatures
   after a peak. {2.2, 2.3, 2.6, 4.3.7}

   CDR deployed at scale is unproven, and reliance on such technology is a
   major risk in the ability to limit warming to 1.5°C. CDR is needed less
   in pathways with particularly strong emphasis on energy efficiency and
   low demand. The scale and type of CDR deployment varies widely across
   1.5°C pathways, with different consequences for achieving sustainable
   development objectives (high confidence). Some pathways rely more on
   bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), while others rely
   more on afforestation, which are the two CDR methods most often
   included in integrated pathways. Trade-offs with other sustainability
   objectives occur predominantly through increased land, energy, water
   and investment demand. Bioenergy use is substantial in 1.5°C pathways
   with or without BECCS due to its multiple roles in decarbonizing energy
   use. {2.3.1, 2.5.3, 2.6.3, 4.3.7}
     __________________________________________________________________

   Properties of Energy and Land Transitions in 1.5°C Pathways

   The share of primary energy from renewables increases while coal usage
   decreases across pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited
   overshoot (high confidence). By 2050, renewables (including bioenergy,
   hydro, wind, and solar, with direct-equivalence method) supply a share
   of 52–67% (interquartile range) of primary energy in 1.5°C pathways
   with no or limited overshoot; while the share from coal decreases to
   1–7% (interquartile range), with a large fraction of this coal use
   combined with carbon capture and storage (CCS). From 2020 to 2050 the
   primary energy supplied by oil declines in most pathways (−39 to −77%
   interquartile range). Natural gas changes by −13% to −62%
   (interquartile range), but some pathways show a marked increase albeit
   with widespread deployment of CCS. The overall deployment of CCS varies
   widely across 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot, with
   cumulative CO[2] stored through 2050 ranging from zero up to 300
   GtCO[2](minimum–maximum range), of which zero up to 140 GtCO[2] is
   stored from biomass. Primary energy supplied by bioenergy ranges from
   40–310 EJ yr^−1 in 2050 (minimum-maximum range), and nuclear from 3–66
   EJ yr^−1 (minimum–maximum range). These ranges reflect both
   uncertainties in technological development and strategic mitigation
   portfolio choices. {2.4.2}

   1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot include a rapid decline in
   the carbon intensity of electricity and an increase in electrification
   of energy end use (high confidence). By 2050, the carbon intensity of
   electricity decreases to −92 to +11 gCO[2] MJ^−1 (minimum–maximum
   range) from about 140 gCO[2] MJ^−1 in 2020, and electricity covers
   34–71% (minimum–maximum range) of final energy across 1.5°C pathways
   with no or limited overshoot from about 20% in 2020. By 2050, the share
   of electricity supplied by renewables increases to 59–97%
   (minimum-maximum range) across 1.5°C pathways with no or limited
   overshoot. Pathways with higher chances of holding warming to below
   1.5°C generally show a faster decline in the carbon intensity of
   electricity by 2030 than pathways that temporarily overshoot 1.5°C.
   {2.4.1, 2.4.2, 2.4.3}

   Transitions in global and regional land use are found in all pathways
   limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, but
   their scale depends on the pursued mitigation portfolio (high
   confidence). Pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C with no or
   limited overshoot project a 4 million km^2 reduction to a 2.5 million
   km^2 increase of non-pasture agricultural land for food and feed crops
   and a 0.5–11 million km^2 reduction of pasture land, to be converted
   into 0-6 million km^2 of agricultural land for energy crops and a 2
   million km^2 reduction to 9.5 million km^2 increase in forests by 2050
   relative to 2010 (medium confidence). Land-use transitions of similar
   magnitude can be observed in modelled 2°C pathways (medium confidence).
   Such large transitions pose profound challenges for sustainable
   management of the various demands on land for human settlements, food,
   livestock feed, fibre, bioenergy, carbon storage, biodiversity and
   other ecosystem services (high confidence). {2.3.4, 2.4.4}
     __________________________________________________________________

   Demand-Side Mitigation and Behavioural Changes

   Demand-side measures are key elements of 1.5°C pathways. Lifestyle
   choices lowering energy demand and the land- and GHG-intensity of food
   consumption can further support achievement of 1.5°C pathways (high
   confidence). By 2030 and 2050, all end-use sectors (including building,
   transport, and industry) show marked energy demand reductions in
   modelled 1.5°C pathways, comparable and beyond those projected in 2°C
   pathways. Sectoral models support the scale of these reductions.

   Links between 1.5°C Pathways and Sustainable Development

   Choices about mitigation portfolios for limiting warming to 1.5°C can
   positively or negatively impact the achievement of other societal
   objectives, such as sustainable development (high confidence). In
   particular, demand-side and efficiency measures, and lifestyle choices
   that limit energy, resource, and GHG-intensive food demand support
   sustainable development (medium confidence). Limiting warming to 1.5°C
   can be achieved synergistically with poverty alleviation and improved
   energy security and can provide large public health benefits through
   improved air quality, preventing millions of premature deaths. However,
   specific mitigation measures, such as bioenergy, may result in
   trade-offs that require consideration. {2.5.1, 2.5.2, 2.5.3}

   Why is it necessary and even vital to maintain the global temperature
   increase below 1.5°C versus higher levels? Adaptation will be less
   difficult. Our world will suffer less negative impacts on intensity and
   frequency of extreme events, on resources, ecosystems, biodiversity,
   food security, cities, tourism, and carbon removal.

Chapter 3

Executive Summary

   This chapter builds on findings of AR5 and assesses new scientific
   evidence of changes in the climate system and the associated impacts on
   natural and human systems, with a specific focus on the magnitude and
   pattern of risks linked for global warming of 1.5°C above temperatures
   in the pre-industrial period. Chapter 3 explores observed impacts and
   projected risks to a range of natural and human systems, with a focus
   on how risk levels change from 1.5°C to 2°C of global warming. The
   chapter also revisits major categories of risk (Reasons for Concern,
   RFC) based on the assessment of new knowledge that has become available
   since AR5.

    1.5°C and 2°C Warmer Worlds

   The global climate has changed relative to the pre-industrial period,
   and there are multiple lines of evidence that these changes have had
   impacts on organisms and ecosystems, as well as on human systems and
   well-being (high confidence). The increase in global mean surface
   temperature (GMST), which reached 0.87°C in 2006–2015 relative to
   1850–1900, has increased the frequency and magnitude of impacts (high
   confidence), strengthening evidence of how an increase in GMST of 1.5°C
   or more could impact natural and human systems (1.5°C versus 2°C).
   {3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, Cross-Chapter Boxes 6, 7 and 8 in this chapter}

   Human-induced global warming has already caused multiple observed
   changes in the climate system (high confidence). Changes include
   increases in both land and ocean temperatures, as well as more frequent
   heatwaves in most land regions (high confidence). There is also (high
   confidence) global warming has resulted in an increase in the frequency
   and duration of marine heatwaves. Further, there is substantial
   evidence that human-induced global warming has led to an increase in
   the frequency, intensity and/or amount of heavy precipitation events at
   the global scale (medium confidence), as well as an increased risk of
   drought in the Mediterranean region (medium confidence). {3.3.1, 3.3.2,
   3.3.3, 3.3.4, Box 3.4}

   Trends in intensity and frequency of some climate and weather extremes
   have been detected over time spans during which about 0.5°C of global
   warming occurred (medium confidence). This assessment is based on
   several lines of evidence, including attribution studies for changes in
   extremes since 1950. {3.2, 3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4}

   Several regional changes in climate are assessed to occur with global
   warming up to 1.5°C as compared to pre-industrial levels, including
   warming of extreme temperatures in many regions (high confidence),
   increases in frequency, intensity and/or amount of heavy precipitation
   in several regions (high confidence), and an increase in intensity or
   frequency of droughts in some regions (medium confidence). {3.3.1,
   3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4, Table 3.2}

   There is no single ‘1.5°C warmer world’ (high confidence). In addition
   to the overall increase in GMST, it is important to consider the size
   and duration of potential overshoots in temperature. Furthermore, there
   are questions on how the stabilization of an increase in GMST of 1.5°C
   can be achieved, and how policies might be able to influence the
   resilience of human and natural systems, and the nature of regional and
   subregional risks. Overshooting poses large risks for natural and human
   systems, especially if the temperature at peak warming is high, because
   some risks may be long-lasting and irreversible, such as the loss of
   some ecosystems (high confidence). The rate of change for several types
   of risks may also have relevance, with potentially large risks in the
   case of a rapid rise to overshooting temperatures, even if a decrease
   to 1.5°C can be achieved at the end of the 21st century or later
   (medium confidence). If overshoot is to be minimized, the remaining
   equivalent CO[2] budget available for emissions is very small, which
   implies that large, immediate and unprecedented global efforts to
   mitigate greenhouse gases are required (high confidence). {3.2, 3.6.2,
   Cross-Chapter Box 8 in this chapter}

   Robust^1 global differences in temperature means and extremes are
   expected if global warming reaches 1.5°C versus 2°C above the
   pre-industrial levels (high confidence). For oceans, regional surface
   temperature means and extremes are projected to be higher at 2°C
   compared to 1.5°C of global warming (high confidence). Temperature
   means and extremes are also projected to be higher at 2°C compared to
   1.5°C in most land regions, with increases being 2–3 times greater than
   the increase in GMST projected for some regions (high confidence).
   Robust increases in temperature means and extremes are also projected
   at 1.5°C compared to present-day values (high confidence) {3.3.1,
   3.3.2}. There are decreases in the occurrence of cold extremes, but
   substantial increases in their temperature, in particular in regions
   with snow or ice cover (high confidence) {3.3.1}.

   Climate models project robust^2 differences in regional climate between
   present-day and global warming up to 1.5°C^3, and between 1.5°C and
   2°C^4 (high confidence), depending on the variable and region in
   question (high confidence). Large, robust and widespread differences
   are expected for temperature extremes (high confidence). Regarding hot
   extremes, the strongest warming is expected to occur at mid-latitudes
   in the warm season (with increases of up to 3°C for 1.5°C of global
   warming, i.e., a factor of two) and at high latitudes in the cold
   season (with increases of up to 4.5°C at 1.5°C of global warming, i.e.,
   a factor of three) (high confidence). The strongest warming of hot
   extremes is projected to occur in central and eastern North America,
   central and southern Europe, the Mediterranean region (including
   southern Europe, northern Africa and the Near East), western and
   central Asia, and southern Africa (medium confidence). The number of
   exceptionally hot days are expected to increase the most in the
   tropics, where interannual temperature variability is lowest; extreme
   heatwaves are thus projected to emerge earliest in these regions, and
   they are expected to already become widespread there at 1.5°C global
   warming (high confidence). Limiting global warming to 1.5°C instead of
   2°C could result in around 420 million fewer people being frequently
   exposed to extreme heatwaves, and about 65 million fewer people being
   exposed to exceptional heatwaves, assuming constant vulnerability
   (medium confidence). {3.3.1, 3.3.2, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in this
   chapter}

   Limiting global warming to 1.5°C would limit risks of increases in
   heavy precipitation events on a global scale and in several regions
   compared to conditions at 2°C global warming (medium confidence). The
   regions with the largest increases in heavy precipitation events for
   1.5°C to 2°C global warming include: several high-latitude regions
   (e.g. Alaska/western Canada, eastern Canada/ Greenland/Iceland,
   northern Europe and northern Asia); mountainous regions (e.g.,Tibetan
   Plateau); eastern Asia (including China and Japan); and eastern North
   America (medium confidence). Tropical cyclones are projected to
   decrease in frequency but with an increase in the number of very
   intense cyclones (limited evidence, low confidence). Heavy
   precipitation associated with tropical cyclones is projected to be
   higher at 2°C compared to 1.5°C of global warming (medium confidence).
   Heavy precipitation, when aggregated at a global scale, is projected to
   be higher at 2°C than at 1.5°C of global warming (medium confidence)
   {3.3.3, 3.3.6}

   Limiting global warming to 1.5°C is expected to substantially reduce
   the probability of extreme drought, precipitation deficits, and risks
   associated with water availability (i.e., water stress) in some regions
   (medium confidence). In particular, risks associated with increases in
   drought frequency and magnitude are projected to be substantially
   larger at 2°C than at 1.5°C in the Mediterranean region (including
   southern Europe, northern Africa and the Near East) and southern Africa
   (medium confidence). {3.3.3, 3.3.4, Box 3.1, Box 3.2}

   Risks to natural and human systems are expected to be lower at 1.5°C
   than at 2°C of global warming (high confidence). This difference is due
   to the smaller rates and magnitudes of climate change associated with a
   1.5°C temperature increase, including lower frequencies and intensities
   of temperature-related extremes. Lower rates of change enhance the
   ability of natural and human systems to adapt, with substantial
   benefits for a wide range of terrestrial, freshwater, wetland, coastal
   and ocean ecosystems (including coral reefs) (high confidence), as well
   as food production systems, human health, and tourism (medium
   confidence), together with energy systems and transportation (low
   confidence). {3.3.1, 3.4}

   Exposure to multiple and compound climate-related risks is projected to
   increase between 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming with greater
   proportions of people both exposed and susceptible to poverty in Africa
   and Asia (high confidence). For global warming from 1.5°C to 2°C, risks
   across energy, food, and water sectors could overlap spatially and
   temporally, creating new – and exacerbating current – hazards,
   exposures, and vulnerabilities that could affect increasing numbers of
   people and regions (medium confidence). Small island states and
   economically disadvantaged populations are particularly at risk (high
   confidence). {3.3.1, 3.4.5.3, 3.4.5.6, 3.4.11, 3.5.4.9, Box 3.5}

   Global warming of 2°C would lead to an expansion of areas with
   significant increases in runoff, as well as those affected by flood
   hazard, compared to conditions at 1.5°C (medium confidence). Global
   warming of 1.5°C would also lead to an expansion of the global land
   area with significant increases in runoff (medium confidence) and an
   increase in flood hazard in some regions (medium confidence) compared
   to present-day conditions. {3.3.5}

   The probability of a sea-ice-free Arctic Ocean^5  during summer is
   substantially higher at 2°C compared to 1.5°C of global warming (medium
   confidence). Model simulations suggest that at least one sea-ice-free
   Arctic summer is expected every 10 years for global warming of 2°C,
   with the frequency decreasing to one sea-ice-free Arctic summer every
   100 years under 1.5°C (medium confidence). An intermediate temperature
   overshoot will have no long- term consequences for Arctic sea ice
   coverage, and hysteresis is not expected (high confidence). {3.3.8,
   3.4.4.7}

   Global mean sea level rise (GMSLR) is projected to be around 0.1 m
   (0.04 – 0.16 m) less by the end of the 21st century in a 1.5°C warmer
   world compared to a 2°C warmer world (medium confidence). Projected
   GMSLR for 1.5°C of global warming has an indicative range of 0.26 –
   0.77m, relative to 1986–2005, (medium confidence). A smaller sea level
   rise could mean that up to 10.4 million fewer people (based on the 2010
   global population and assuming no adaptation) would be exposed to the
   impacts of sea level rise globally in 2100 at 1.5°C compared to at 2°C.
   A slower rate of sea level rise enables greater opportunities for
   adaptation (medium confidence). There is high confidence that sea level
   rise will continue beyond 2100. Instabilities exist for both the
   Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which could result in multi-meter
   rises in sea level on time scales of century to millennia. There is
   (medium confidence) that these instabilities could be triggered at
   around 1.5°C to 2°C of global warming. {3.3.9, 3.4.5, 3.6.3}

   The ocean has absorbed about 30% of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide,
   resulting in ocean acidification and changes to carbonate chemistry
   that are unprecedented for at least the last 65 million years (high
   confidence). Risks have been identified for the survival,
   calcification, growth, development and abundance of a broad range of
   marine taxonomic groups, ranging from algae to fish, with substantial
   evidence of predictable trait-based sensitivities (high confidence).
   There are multiple lines of evidence that ocean warming and
   acidification corresponding to 1.5°C of global warming would impact a
   wide range of marine organisms and ecosystems, as well as sectors such
   as aquaculture and fisheries (high confidence). {3.3.10, 3.4.4}

   Larger risks are expected for many regions and systems for global
   warming at 1.5°C, as compared to today, with adaptation required now
   and up to 1.5°C. However, risks would be larger at 2°C of warming and
   an even greater effort would be needed for adaptation to a temperature
   increase of that magnitude (high confidence). {3.4, Box 3.4, Box 3.5,
   Cross-Chapter Box 6 in this chapter}

   Future risks at 1.5°C of global warming will depend on the mitigation
   pathway and on the possible occurrence of a transient overshoot (high
   confidence). The impacts on natural and human systems would be greater
   if mitigation pathways temporarily overshoot 1.5°C and return to 1.5°C
   later in the century, as compared to pathways that stabilize at 1.5°C
   without an overshoot (high confidence). The size and duration of an
   overshoot would also affect future impacts (e.g., irreversible loss of
   some ecosystems) (high confidence). Changes in land use resulting from
   mitigation choices could have impacts on food production and ecosystem
   diversity. {3.6.1, 3.6.2, Cross-Chapter Boxes 7 and 8 in this chapter}

   Climate Change Risks for Natural and Human systems

   Terrestrial and Wetland Ecosystems

   Risks of local species losses and, consequently, risks of extinction
   are much less in a 1.5°C versus a 2°C warmer world (high confidence).
   The number of species projected to lose over half of their climatically
   determined geographic range at 2°C global warming (18% of insects, 16%
   of plants, 8% of vertebrates) is projected to be reduced to 6% of
   insects, 8% of plants and 4% of vertebrates at 1.5°C warming (medium
   confidence). Risks associated with other biodiversity-related factors,
   such as forest fires, extreme weather events, and the spread of
   invasive species, pests and diseases, would also be lower at 1.5°C than
   at 2°C of warming (high confidence), supporting a greater persistence
   of ecosystem services.
   {3.4.3, 3.5.2}

   Constraining global warming to 1.5°C, rather than to 2°C and higher, is
   projected to have many benefits for terrestrial and wetland ecosystems
   and for the preservation of their services to humans (high confidence).
   Risks for natural and managed ecosystems are higher on drylands
   compared to humid lands. The global terrestrial land area projected to
   be affected by ecosystem transformations (13%, interquartile range
   8–20%) at 2°C is approximately halved at 1.5°C global warming to 4%
   (interquartile range 2–7%) (medium confidence). Above 1.5°C, an
   expansion of desert terrain and vegetation would occur in the
   Mediterranean biome (medium confidence), causing changes unparalleled
   in the last 10,000 years (medium confidence). {3.3.2.2, 3.4.3.2,
   3.4.3.5, 3.4.6.1, 3.5.5.10, Box 4.2}

   Many impacts are projected to be larger at higher latitudes, owing to
   mean and cold-season warming rates above the global average (medium
   confidence). High-latitude tundra and boreal forest are particularly at
   risk, and woody shrubs are already encroaching into tundra (high
   confidence) and will proceed with further warming. Constraining warming
   to 1.5°C would prevent the thawing of an estimated permafrost area of
   1.5 to 2.5 million km^2 over centuries compared to thawing under 2°C
   (medium confidence). {3.3.2, 3.4.3, 3.4.4}

   Ocean Ecosystems

   Ocean ecosystems are already experiencing large-scale changes, and
   critical thresholds are expected to be reached at 1.5°C and higher
   levels of global warming (high confidence). In the transition to 1.5°C
   of warming, changes to water temperatures are expected to drive some
   species (e.g., plankton, fish) to relocate to higher latitudes and
   cause novel ecosystems to assemble (high confidence). Other ecosystems
   (e.g., kelp forests, coral reefs) are relatively less able to move,
   however, and are projected to experience high rates of mortality and
   loss (very high confidence). For example, multiple lines of evidence
   indicate that the majority (70–90%) of warm water (tropical) coral
   reefs that exist today will disappear even if global warming is
   constrained to 1.5°C (very high confidence). {3.4.4, Box 3.4}

   Current ecosystem services from the ocean are expected to be reduced at
   1.5°C of global warming, with losses being even greater at 2°C of
   global warming (high confidence). The risks of declining ocean
   productivity, shifts of species to higher latitudes, damage to
   ecosystems (e.g., coral reefs, and mangroves, seagrass and other
   wetland ecosystems), loss of fisheries productivity (at low latitudes),
   and changes to ocean chemistry (e.g., acidification, hypoxia and dead
   zones) are projected to be substantially lower when global warming is
   limited to 1.5°C (high confidence). {3.4.4, Box 3.4}

   Water Resources

   The projected frequency and magnitude of floods and droughts in some
   regions are smaller under 1.5°C than under 2°C of warming (medium
   confidence). Human exposure to increased flooding is projected to be
   substantially lower at 1.5°C compared to 2°C of global warming,
   although projected changes create regionally differentiated risks
   (medium confidence). The differences in the risks among regions are
   strongly influenced by local socio-economic conditions (medium
   confidence). {3.3.4, 3.3.5, 3.4.2}

   Risks of water scarcity are projected to be greater at 2°C than at
   1.5°C of global warming in some regions (medium confidence). Depending
   on future socio-economic conditions, limiting global warming to 1.5°C,
   compared to 2°C, may reduce the proportion of the world population
   exposed to a climate change-induced increase in water stress by up to
   50%, although there is considerable variability between regions (medium
   confidence). Regions with particularly large benefits could include the
   Mediterranean and the Caribbean (medium confidence). Socio-economic
   drivers, however, are expected to have a greater influence on these
   risks than the changes in climate (medium confidence). {3.3.5, 3.4.2,
   Box 3.5}

   Land Use, Food Security and Food Production Systems

   Limiting global warming to 1.5°C, compared with 2°C, is projected to
   result in smaller net reductions in yields of maize, rice, wheat, and
   potentially other cereal crops, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa,
   Southeast Asia, and Central and South America; and in the
   CO[2]-dependent nutritional quality of rice and wheat (high
   confidence). A loss of 7–10% of rangeland livestock globally is
   projected for approximately 2°C of warming, with considerable economic
   consequences for many communities and regions (medium confidence).
   {3.4.6, 3.6, Box 3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in this chapter}

   Reductions in projected food availability are larger at 2°C than at
   1.5°C of global warming in the Sahel, southern Africa, the
   Mediterranean, central Europe and the Amazon (medium confidence). This
   suggests a transition from medium to high risk of regionally
   differentiated impacts on food security between 1.5°C and 2°C (medium
   confidence). Future economic and trade environments and their response
   to changing food availability (medium confidence) are important
   potential adaptation options for reducing hunger risk in low- and
   middle-income countries. {Cross-Chapter Box 6 in this chapter}

   Fisheries and aquaculture are important to global food security but are
   already facing increasing risks from ocean warming and acidification
   (medium confidence). These risks are projected to increase at 1.5°C of
   global warming and impact key organisms such as fin fish and bivalves
   (e.g., oysters), especially at low latitudes (medium confidence).
   Small-scale fisheries in tropical regions, which are very dependent on
   habitat provided by coastal ecosystems such as coral reefs, mangroves,
   seagrass and kelp forests, are expected to face growing risks at 1.5°C
   of warming because of loss of habitat (medium confidence). Risks of
   impacts and decreasing food security are projected to become greater as
   global warming reaches beyond 1.5°C and both ocean warming and
   acidification increase, with substantial losses likely for coastal
   livelihoods and industries (e.g., fisheries and aquaculture) (medium to
   high confidence). {3.4.4, 3.4.5, 3.4.6, Box 3.1, Box 3.4, Box 3.5,
   Cross-Chapter Box 6 in this chapter}

   Land use and land-use change emerge as critical features of virtually
   all mitigation pathways that seek to limit global warming to 1.5°C
   (high confidence). Most least-cost mitigation pathways to limit peak or
   end-of-century warming to 1.5°C make use of carbon dioxide removal
   (CDR), predominantly employing significant levels of bioenergy with
   carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and/or afforestation and
   reforestation (AR) in their portfolio of mitigation measures (high
   confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 7 in this chapter}

   Large-scale deployment of BECCS and/or AR would have a far-reaching
   land and water footprint (high confidence). Whether this footprint
   would result in adverse impacts, for example on biodiversity or food
   production, depends on the existence and effectiveness of measures to
   conserve land carbon stocks, measures to limit agricultural expansion
   in order to protect natural ecosystems, and the potential to increase
   agricultural productivity (medium agreement). In addition, BECCS and/or
   AR would have substantial direct effects on regional climate through
   biophysical feedbacks, which are generally not included in Integrated
   Assessments Models (high confidence). {3.6.2, Cross-Chapter Boxes 7 and
   8 in this chapter}

   The impacts of large-scale CDR deployment could be greatly reduced if a
   wider portfolio of CDR options were deployed, if a holistic policy for
   sustainable land management were adopted, and if increased mitigation
   efforts were employed to strongly limit the demand for land, energy and
   material resources, including through lifestyle and dietary changes
   (medium confidence). In particular, reforestation could be associated
   with significant co-benefits if implemented in a manner than helps
   restore natural ecosystems (high confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 7 in
   this chapter}

   Human Health, Well-Being, Cities and Poverty

   Any increase in global temperature (e.g., +0.5°C) is projected to
   affect human health, with primarily negative consequences (high
   confidence). Lower risks are projected at 1.5°C than at 2°C for
   heat-related morbidity and mortality (very high confidence), and for
   ozone-related mortality if emissions needed for ozone formation remain
   high (high confidence). Urban heat islands often amplify the impacts of
   heatwaves in cities (high confidence). Risks for some vector-borne
   diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever are projected to increase
   with warming from 1.5°C to 2°C, including potential shifts in their
   geographic range (high confidence). Overall for vector- borne diseases,
   whether projections are positive or negative depends on the disease,
   region and extent of change (high confidence). Lower risks of
   undernutrition are projected at 1.5°C than at 2°C (medium confidence).
   Incorporating estimates of adaptation into projections reduces the
   magnitude of risks (high confidence). {3.4.7, 3.4.7.1, 3.4.8, 3.5.5.8}

   Global warming of 2°C is expected to pose greater risks to urban areas
   than global warming of 1.5°C (medium confidence). The extent of risk
   depends on human vulnerability and the effectiveness of adaptation for
   regions (coastal and non-coastal), informal settlements and
   infrastructure sectors (such as energy, water and transport) (high
   confidence). {3.4.5, 3.4.8}

   Poverty and disadvantage have increased with recent warming (about 1°C)
   and are expected to increase for many populations as average global
   temperatures increase from 1°C to 1.5°C and higher (medium confidence).
   Outmigration in agricultural- dependent communities is positively and
   statistically significantly associated with global temperature (medium
   confidence). Our understanding of the links of 1.5°C and 2°C of global
   warming to human migration are limited and represent an important
   knowledge gap. {3.4.10, 3.4.11, 5.2.2, Table 3.5}

   Key Economic Sectors and Services

   Risks to global aggregated economic growth due to climate change
   impacts are projected to be lower at 1.5°C than at 2°C by the end of
   this century (medium confidence). {3.5.2, 3.5.3} The largest reductions
   in economic growth at 2°C compared to 1.5°C of warming are projected
   for low- and middle-income countries and regions (the African
   continent, Southeast Asia, India, Brazil and Mexico) (low to medium
   confidence). Countries in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere
   subtropics are projected to experience the largest impacts on economic
   growth due to climate change should global warming increase from 1.5°C
   to 2°C (medium confidence). {3.5} Global warming has already affected
   tourism, with increased risks projected under 1.5°C of warming in
   specific geographic regions and for seasonal tourism including sun,
   beach and snow sports destinations (very high confidence). Risks will
   be lower for tourism markets that are less climate sensitive, such as
   gaming and large hotel-based activities (high confidence). Risks for
   coastal tourism, particularly in subtropical and tropical regions, will
   increase with temperature-related degradation (e.g., heat extremes,
   storms) or loss of beach and coral reef assets (high confidence).
   {3.3.6, 3.4.4.12, 3.4.9.1, Box 3.4}

   Small Islands, and Coastal and Low-lying areas

   Small islands are projected to experience multiple inter- related risks
   at 1.5°C of global warming that will increase with warming of 2°C and
   higher levels (high confidence). Climate hazards at 1.5°C are projected
   to be lower compared to those at 2°C (high confidence). Long-term risks
   of coastal flooding and impacts on populations, infrastructures and
   assets (high confidence), freshwater stress (medium confidence), and
   risks across marine ecosystems (high confidence) and critical sectors
   (medium confidence) are projected to increase at 1.5°C compared to
   present-day levels and increase further at 2°C, limiting adaptation
   opportunities and increasing loss and damage (medium confidence).
   Migration in small islands (internally and internationally) occurs for
   multiple reasons and purposes, mostly for better livelihood
   opportunities (high confidence) and increasingly owing to sea level
   rise (medium confidence). {3.3.2.2, 3.3.6–9, 3.4.3.2, 3.4.4.2, 3.4.4.5,
   3.4.4.12, 3.4.5.3, 3.4.7.1, 3.4.9.1, 3.5.4.9, Box 3.4, Box 3.5}

   Impacts associated with sea level rise and changes to the salinity of
   coastal groundwater, increased flooding and damage to infrastructure,
   are projected to be critically important in vulnerable environments,
   such as small islands, low-lying coasts and deltas, at global warming
   of 1.5°C and 2°C (high confidence). Localized subsidence and changes to
   river discharge can potentially exacerbate these effects. Adaptation is
   already happening (high confidence) and will remain important over
   multi-centennial time scales. {3.4.5.3, 3.4.5.4, 3.4.5.7, 5.4.5.4, Box
   3.5}

   Existing and restored natural coastal ecosystems may be effective in
   reducing the adverse impacts of rising sea levels and intensifying
   storms by protecting coastal and deltaic regions (medium confidence).
   Natural sedimentation rates are expected to be able to offset the
   effect of rising sea levels, given the slower rates of sea level rise
   associated with 1.5°C of warming (medium confidence). Other feedbacks,
   such as landward migration of wetlands and the adaptation of
   infrastructure, remain important (medium confidence). {3.4.4.12,
   3.4.5.4, 3.4.5.7}

   Increased Reasons for Concern

   There are multiple lines of evidence that since AR5 the assessed levels
   of risk increased for four of the five Reasons for Concern (RFCs) for
   global warming levels of up to 2°C (high confidence). The risk
   transitions by degrees of global warming are now: from high to very
   high between 1.5°C and 2°C for RFC1 (Unique and threatened systems)
   (high confidence); from moderate to high risk between 1°C and 1.5°C for
   RFC2 (Extreme weather events) (medium confidence); from moderate to
   high risk between 1.5°C and 2°C for RFC3 (Distribution of impacts)
   (high confidence); from moderate to high risk between 1.5°C and 2.5°C
   for RFC4 (Global aggregate impacts) (medium confidence); and from
   moderate to high risk between 1°C and 2.5°C for RFC5 (Large-scale
   singular events) (medium confidence). {3.5.2}
    1. The category ‘Unique and threatened systems’ (RFC1) display a
       transition from high to very high risk which is now located between
       1.5°C and 2°C of global warming as opposed to at 2.6°C of global
       warming in AR5, owing to new and multiple lines of evidence for
       changing risks for coral reefs, the Arctic and biodiversity in
       general (high confidence). {3.5.2.1}
    2. In ‘Extreme weather events’ (RFC2), the transition from moderate to
       high risk is now located between 1.0°C and 1.5°C of global warming,
       which is very similar to the AR5 assessment but is projected with
       greater confidence (medium confidence). The impact literature
       contains little information about the potential for human society
       to adapt to extreme weather events, and hence it has not been
       possible to locate the transition from ‘high’ to ‘very high’ risk
       within the context of assessing impacts at 1.5°C versus 2°C of
       global warming. There is thus low confidence in the level at which
       global warming could lead to very high risks associated with
       extreme weather events in the context of this report. {3.5}
    3. With respect to the ‘Distribution of impacts’ (RFC3) a transition
       from moderate to high risk is now located between 1.5°C and 2°C of
       global warming, compared with between 1.6°C and 2.6°C global
       warming in AR5, owing to new evidence about regionally
       differentiated risks to food security, water resources, drought,
       heat exposure and coastal submergence (high confidence). {3.5}
    4. In ‘global aggregate impacts’ (RFC4) a transition from moderate to
       high levels of risk is now located between 1.5°C and 1.5°C of
       global warming, as opposed to at 3.6°C of warming in AR5, owing to
       new evidence about global aggregate economic impacts and risks to
       Earth’s biodiversity (medium confidence). {3.5}
    5. Finally, ‘large-scale singular events’ (RFC5), moderate risk is now
       located at 1°C of global warming and high risk is located at 2.5°C
       of global warming, as opposed to at 1.6°C (moderate risk) and
       around 4°C (high risk) in AR5, because of new observations and
       models of the West Antarctic ice sheet (medium confidence). {3.3.9,
       3.5.2, 3.6.3}

Chapter 4

Executive Summary

   Limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels would require
   transformative systemic change, integrated with sustainable
   development. Such change would require the upscaling and acceleration
   of the implementation of far- reaching, multilevel and cross-sectoral
   climate mitigation and addressing barriers. Such systemic change would
   need to be linked to complementary adaptation actions, including
   transformational adaptation, especially for pathways that temporarily
   overshoot 1.5°C (medium evidence,high agreement) {Chapter 2, Chapter 3,
   4.2.1, 4.4.5, 4.5}. Current national pledges on mitigation and
   adaptation are not enough to stay below the Paris Agreement temperature
   limits and achieve its adaptation goals. While transitions in energy
   efficiency, carbon intensity of fuels, electrification and land-use
   change are underway in various countries, limiting warming to 1.5°C
   will require a greater scale and pace of change to transform energy,
   land, urban and industrial systems globally. {4.3, 4.4, Cross-Chapter
   Box 9 in this Chapter}

   Although multiple communities around the world are demonstrating the
   possibility of implementation consistent with 1.5°C pathways {Boxes
   4.1-4.10}, very few countries, regions, cities, communities or
   businesses can currently make such a claim (high confidence). To
   strengthen the global response, almost all countries would need to
   significantly raise their level of ambition. Implementation of this
   raised ambition would require enhanced institutional capabilities in
   all countries, including building the capability to utilize indigenous
   and local knowledge (medium evidence, high agreement). In developing
   countries and for poor and vulnerable people, implementing the response
   would require financial, technological and other forms of support to
   build capacity, for which additional local, national and international
   resources would need to be mobilized (high confidence). However,
   public, financial, institutional and innovation capabilities currently
   fall short of implementing far-reaching measures at scale in all
   countries (high confidence). Transnational networks that support
   multilevel climate action are growing, but challenges in their scale-up
   remain. {4.4.1, 4.4.2, 4.4.4, 4.4.5, Box 4.1, Box 4.2, Box 4.7}

   Adaptation needs will be lower in a 1.5°C world compared to a 2°C world
   (high confidence) {Chapter 3; Cross-Chapter Box 11 in this chapter}.
   Learning from current adaptation practices and strengthening them
   through adaptive governance {4.4.1}, lifestyle and behavioural change
   {4.4.3} and innovative financing mechanisms {4.4.5} can help their
   mainstreaming within sustainable development practices.Preventing
   maladaptation,drawing on bottom-up approaches
   {Box 4.6} and using indigenous knowledge {Box 4.3} would effectively
   engage and protect vulnerable people and communities. While adaptation
   finance has increased quantitatively, significant further expansion
   would be needed to adapt to 1.5°C. Qualitative gaps in the distribution
   of adaptation finance, readiness to absorb resources, and monitoring
   mechanisms undermine the potential of adaptation finance to reduce
   impacts. {Chapter 3, 4.4.2, 4.4.5, 4.6}
     __________________________________________________________________

   System Transitions

   The energy system transition that would be required to limit global
   warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial conditions is underway in many
   sectors and regions around the world (medium evidence, high agreement).
   The political, economic, social and technical feasibility of solar
   energy, wind energy and electricity storage technologies has improved
   dramatically over the past few years, while that of nuclear energy and
   carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) in the electricity sector have
   not shown similar improvements. {4.3.1}

   Electrification, hydrogen, bio-based feedstocks and substitution, and,
   in several cases, carbon dioxide capture, utilization and storage
   (CCUS), would lead to the deep emissions reductions required in
   energy-intensive industries to limit warming to 1.5°C. However, those
   options are limited by institutional, economic and technical
   constraints, which increase financial risks to many incumbent firms
   (medium evidence, high agreement). Energy efficiency in industry is
   more economically feasible and helps enable industrial system
   transitions but would have to be complemented with greenhouse gas
   (GHG)-neutral processes or carbon dioxide removal (CDR) to make
   energy-intensive industries consistent with 1.5°C (high confidence).
   {4.3.1, 4.3.4}

   Global and regional land-use and ecosystems transitions and associated
   changes in behaviour that would be required to limit warming to 1.5°C
   can enhance future adaptation and land-based agricultural and forestry
   mitigation potential. Such transitions could, however, carry
   consequences for livelihoods that depend on agriculture and natural
   resources {4.3.2, Cross- Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3}. Alterations of
   agriculture and forest systems to achieve mitigation goals could affect
   current ecosystems and their services and potentially threaten food,
   water and livelihood security. While this could limit the social and
   environmental feasibility of land-based mitigation options, careful
   design and implementation could enhance their acceptability and support
   sustainable development objectives (medium evidence, medium agreement).
   {4.3.2, 4.5.3}

   Changing agricultural practices can be an effective climate adaptation
   strategy. A diversity of adaptation options exists, including mixed
   crop-livestock production systems which can be a cost-effective
   adaptation strategy in many global agriculture systems (robust
   evidence, medium agreement). Improving irrigation efficiency could
   effectively deal with changing global water endowments, especially if
   achieved via farmers adopting new behaviours and water- efficient
   practices rather than through large-scale infrastructural interventions
   (medium evidence, medium agreement). Well-designed adaptation processes
   such as community-based adaptation can be effective depending upon
   context and levels of vulnerability. {4.3.2, 4.5.3}

   Improving the efficiency of food production and closing yield gaps have
   the potential to reduce emissions from agriculture, reduce pressure on
   land, and enhance food security and future mitigation potential (high
   confidence). Improving productivity of existing agricultural systems
   generally reduces the emissions intensity of food production and offers
   strong synergies with rural development, poverty reduction and food
   security objectives, but options to reduce absolute emissions are
   limited unless paired with demand-side measures. Technological
   innovation including biotechnology, with adequate safeguards, could
   contribute to resolving current feasibility constraints and expand the
   future mitigation potential of agriculture.
   {4.3.2, 4.4.4}

   Shifts in dietary choices towards foods with lower emissions and
   requirements for land, along with reduced food loss and waste, could
   reduce emissions and increase adaptation options (high confidence).
   Decreasing food loss and waste and changing dietary behaviour could
   result in mitigation and adaptation (high confidence) by reducing both
   emissions and pressure on land, with significant co-benefits for food
   security, human health and sustainable development {4.3.2, 4.4.5,
   4.5.2, 4.5.3, 5.4.2}, but evidence of successful policies to modify
   dietary choices remains limited.

   Mitigation and Adaptation Options and Other Measures

   A mix of mitigation and adaptation options implemented in a
   participatory and integrated manner can enable rapid, systemic
   transitions – in urban and rural areas – that are necessary elements of
   an accelerated transition consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C.
   Such options and changes are most effective when aligned with economic
   and sustainable development, and when local and regional governments
   are supported by national governments {4.3.3, 4.4.1, 4.4.3}. Various
   mitigation options are expanding rapidly across many geographies.
   Although many have development synergies, not all income groups have so
   far benefited from them. Electrification, end-use energy efficiency and
   increased share of renewables, amongst other options, are lowering
   energy use and decarbonizing energy supply in the built environment,
   especially in buildings. Other rapid changes needed in urban
   environments include demotorization and decarbonization of transport,
   including the expansion of electric vehicles, and greater use of
   energy-efficient appliances (medium evidence, high agreement).
   Technological and social innovations can contribute to limiting warming
   to 1.5°C, for example, by enabling the use of smart grids, energy
   storage technologies and general-purpose technologies, such as
   information and communication technology (ICT) that can be deployed to
   help reduce emissions. Feasible adaptation options include green
   infrastructure, resilient water and urban ecosystem services, urban and
   peri-urban agriculture, and adapting buildings and land use through
   regulation and planning (medium evidence, medium to high agreement).
   {4.3.3, 4.4.3, 4.4.4}

   Synergies can be achieved across systemic transitions through several
   overarching adaptation options in rural and urban areas. Investments in
   health, social security and risk sharing and spreading are
   cost-effective adaptation measures with high potential for scaling up
   (medium evidence, medium to high agreement). Disaster risk management
   and education-based adaptation have lower prospects of scalability and
   cost-effectiveness (medium evidence, high agreement) but are critical
   for building adaptive capacity. {4.3.5, 4.5.3}

   Converging adaptation and mitigation options can lead to synergies and
   potentially increase cost-effectiveness, but multiple trade-offs can
   limit the speed of and potential for scaling up. Many examples of
   synergies and trade-offs exist in all sectors and system transitions.
   For instance, sustainable water management (high evidence, medium
   agreement) and investment in green infrastructure (medium evidence,
   high agreement) to deliver sustainable water and environmental services
   and to support urban agriculture are less cost-effective than other
   adaptation options but can help build climate resilience. Achieving the
   governance, finance and social support required to enable these
   synergies and to avoid trade-offs is often challenging, especially when
   addressing multiple objectives, and attempting appropriate sequencing
   and timing of interventions. {4.3.2, 4.3.4, 4.4.1, 4.5.2, 4.5.3, 4.5.4}

   Though CO[2] dominates long-term warming, the reduction of warming
   short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs), such as methane and black carbon,
   can in the short term contribute significantly to limiting warming to
   1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Reductions of black carbon and
   methane would have substantial co-benefits (high confidence), including
   improved health due to reduced air pollution. This, in turn, enhances
   the institutional and socio- cultural feasibility of such actions.
   Reductions of several warming SLCFs are constrained by economic and
   social feasibility (low evidence, high agreement). As they are often
   co-emitted with CO[2], achieving the energy, land and urban transitions
   necessary to limit warming to 1.5°C would see emissions of warming
   SLCFs greatly reduced. {2.3.3.2, 4.3.6}

   Most CDR options face multiple feasibility constraints, which differ
   between options, limiting the potential for any single option to
   sustainably achieve the large-scale deployment required in the
   1.5°C-consistent pathways described in Chapter 2 (high confidence).
   Those 1.5°C pathways typically rely on bioenergy with carbon capture
   and storage (BECCS), afforestation and reforestation (AR), or both, to
   neutralize emissions that are expensive to avoid, or to draw down CO[2]
   emissions in excess of the carbon budget {Chapter 2}. Though BECCS and
   AR may be technically and geophysically feasible, they face partially
   overlapping yet different constraints related to land use. The land
   footprint per tonne of CO[2] removed is higher for AR than for BECCS,
   but given the low levels of current deployment, the speed and scales
   required for limiting warming to 1.5°C pose a considerable
   implementation challenge, even if the issues of public acceptance and
   absence of economic incentives were to be resolved (high agreement,
   medium evidence). The large potential of afforestation and the
   co-benefits if implemented appropriately (e.g., on biodiversity and
   soil quality) will diminish over time, as forests saturate (high
   confidence). The energy requirements and economic costs of direct air
   carbon capture and storage (DACCS) and enhanced weathering remain high
   (medium evidence, medium agreement).At the local scale, soil carbon
   sequestration has co-benefits with agriculture and is cost-effective
   even without climate policy (high confidence). Its potential
   feasibility and cost-effectiveness at the global scale appears to be
   more limited. {4.3.7}

   Uncertainties surrounding solar radiation modification (SRM) measures
   constrain their potential deployment. These uncertainties include:
   technological immaturity; limited physical understanding about their
   effectiveness to limit global warming; and a weak capacity to govern,
   legitimize, and scale such measures. Some recent model-based analysis
   suggests SRM would be effective but that it is too early to evaluate
   its feasibility. Even in the uncertain case that the most adverse
   side-effects of SRM can be avoided, public resistance, ethical concerns
   and potential impacts on sustainable development could render SRM
   economically, socially and institutionally undesirable (low agreement,
   medium evidence). {4.3.8, Cross-Chapter Box 10 in this chapter}
     __________________________________________________________________

   Enabling Rapid and Far-Reaching Change

   The speed of transitions and of technological change required to limit
   warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels has been observed in the
   past within specific sectors and technologies {4.2.2.1}. But the
   geographical and economic scales at which the required rates of change
   in the energy, land, urban, infrastructure and industrial systems would
   need to take place are larger and have no documented historic precedent
   (limited evidence, medium agreement). To reduce inequality and
   alleviate poverty, such transformations would require more planning and
   stronger institutions (including inclusive markets) than observed in
   the past, as well as stronger coordination and disruptive innovation
   across actors and scales of governance. {4.3, 4.4}

   Governance consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C and the political
   economy of adaptation and mitigation can enable and accelerate systems
   transitions,behavioural change,innovation and technology deployment
   (medium evidence, medium agreement). For 1.5°C-consistent actions, an
   effective governance framework would include: accountable multilevel
   governance that includes non- state actors, such as industry, civil
   society and scientific institutions; coordinated sectoral and
   cross-sectoral policies that enable collaborative multi-stakeholder
   partnerships; strengthened global-to-local financial architecture that
   enables greater access to finance and technology; addressing
   climate-related trade barriers; improved climate education and greater
   public awareness; arrangements to enable accelerated behaviour change;
   strengthened climate monitoring and evaluation systems; and reciprocal
   international agreements that are sensitive to equity and the
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). System transitions can be enabled
   by enhancing the capacities of public, private and financial
   institutions to accelerate climate change policy planning and
   implementation, along with accelerated technological innovation,
   deployment and upkeep. {4.4.1, 4.4.2, 4.4.3, 4.4.4}

   Behaviour change and demand-side management can significantly reduce
   emissions, substantially limiting the reliance on CDR to limit warming
   to 1.5°C {Chapter 2, 4.4.3}. Political and financial stakeholders may
   find climate actions more cost- effective and socially acceptable if
   multiple factors affecting behaviour are considered, including aligning
   these actions with people’s core values (medium evidence, high
   agreement). Behaviour- and lifestyle- related measures and demand-side
   management have already led to emission reductions around the world and
   can enable significant future reductions (high confidence). Social
   innovation through bottom-up initiatives can result in greater
   participation in the governance of systems transitions and increase
   support for technologies, practices and policies that are part of the
   global response to limit warming to 1.5°C . {Chapter 2, 4.4.1, 4.4.3,
   Figure 4.3}

   This rapid and far-reaching response required to keep warming below
   1.5°C and enhance the capacity to adapt to climate risks would require
   large increases of investments in low-emission infrastructure and
   buildings, along with a redirection of financial flows towards
   low-emission investments (robust evidence, high agreement). An
   estimated mean annual incremental investment of around 1.5% of global
   gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) for the energy sector is indicated
   between 2016 and 2035, as well as about 2.5% of global GFCF for other
   development infrastructure that could also address SDG implementation.
   Though quality policy design and effective implementation may enhance
   efficiency, they cannot fully substitute for these investments. {2.5.2,
   4.2.1, 4.4.5}

   Enabling this investment requires the mobilization and better
   integration of a range of policy instruments that include the reduction
   of socially inefficient fossil fuel subsidy regimes and innovative
   price and non-price national and international policy instruments.
   These would need to be complemented by de-risking financial instruments
   and the emergence of long-term low-emission assets.These instruments
   would aim to reduce the demand for carbon-intensive services and shift
   market preferences away from fossil fuel-based technology. Evidence and
   theory suggest that carbon pricing alone, in the absence of sufficient
   transfers to compensate their unintended distributional cross- sector,
   cross-nation effects, cannot reach the incentive levels needed to
   trigger system transitions (robust evidence, medium agreement). But,
   embedded in consistent policy packages, they can help mobilize
   incremental resources and provide flexible mechanisms that help reduce
   the social and economic costs of the triggering phase of the transition
   (robust evidence, medium agreement). {4.4.3, 4.4.4, 4.4.5}

   Increasing evidence suggests that a climate-sensitive realignment of
   savings and expenditure towards low-emission, climate-resilient
   infrastructure and services requires an evolution of global and
   national financial systems. Estimates suggest that, in addition to
   climate-friendly allocation of public investments, a potential
   redirection of 5% to 10% of the annual capital revenues^1 is necessary
   for limiting warming to 1.5°C {4.4.5, Table 1 in Box 4.8}. This could
   be facilitated by a change of incentives for private day-to-day
   expenditure and the redirection of savings from speculative and
   precautionary investments towards long- term productive low-emission
   assets and services. This implies the mobilization of institutional
   investors and mainstreaming of climate finance within financial and
   banking system regulation. Access by developing countries to low-risk
   and low-interest finance through multilateral and national development
   banks would have to be facilitated (medium evidence, high agreement).
   New forms of public– private partnerships may be needed with
   multilateral, sovereign and sub-sovereign guarantees to de-risk
   climate-friendly investments, support new business models for
   small-scale enterprises and help households with limited access to
   capital. Ultimately, the aim is to promote a portfolio shift towards
   long-term low-emission assets that would help redirect capital away
   from potentially stranded assets (medium evidence, medium agreement).
   {4.4.5}

   Knowledge gaps around implementing and strengthening the global
   response to climate change would need to be urgently resolved if the
   transition to a 1.5°C world is to become reality. Remaining questions
   include: how much can be realistically expected from innovation and
   behavioural and systemic political and economic changes in improving
   resilience, enhancing adaptation and reducing GHG emissions? How can
   rates of changes be accelerated and scaled up? What is the outcome of
   realistic assessments of mitigation and adaptation land transitions
   that are compliant with sustainable development, poverty eradication
   and addressing inequality? What are life-cycle emissions and prospects
   of early-stage CDR options? How can climate and sustainable development
   policies converge, and how can they be organised within a global
   governance framework and financial system, based on principles of
   justice and ethics (including ‘common but differentiated
   responsibilities and respective capabilities’ (CBDR-RC)), reciprocity
   and partnership? To what extent would limiting warming to 1.5°C require
   a harmonization of macro-financial and fiscal policies, which could
   include financial regulators such as central banks? How can different
   actors and processes in climate governance reinforce each other, and
   hedge against the fragmentation of initiatives? {4.1, 4.3.7, 4.4.1,

Chapter 5

Executive Summary

   This chapter takes sustainable development as the starting point and
   focus for analysis. It considers the broad and multifaceted
   bi-directional interplay between sustainable development, including its
   focus on eradicating poverty and reducing inequality in their
   multidimensional aspects, and climate actions in a 1.5°C warmer world.
   These fundamental connections are embedded in the Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs). The chapter also examines synergies and
   trade-offs of adaptation and mitigation options with sustainable
   development and the SDGs and offers insights into possible pathways,
   especially climate-resilient development pathways towards a 1.5°C
   warmer world.

   Sustainable Development, Poverty and Inequality in a 1.5°C Warmer World

   Limiting global warming to 1.5°C rather than 2°C above pre- industrial
   levels would make it markedly easier to achieve many aspects of
   sustainable development, with greater potential to eradicate poverty
   and reduce inequalities (medium evidence, high agreement). Impacts
   avoided with the lower temperature limit could reduce the number of
   people exposed to climate risks and vulnerable to poverty by 62 to 457
   million, and lessen the risks of poor people to experience food and
   water insecurity, adverse health impacts, and economic losses,
   particularly in regions that already face development challenges
   (medium evidence, medium agreement). {5.2.2, 5.2.3} Avoided impacts
   expected to occur between 1.5°C and 2°C warming would also make it
   easier to achieve certain SDGs, such as those that relate to poverty,
   hunger, health, water and sanitation, cities and ecosystems (SDGs 1, 2,
   3, 6, 11, 14 and 15) (medium evidence, high agreement). {5.2.3, Table
   5.2 available at the end of the chapter}

   Compared to current conditions, 1.5°C of global warming would
   nonetheless pose heightened risks to eradicating poverty, reducing
   inequalities and ensuring human and ecosystem well- being (medium
   evidence, high agreement). Warming of 1.5°C is not considered ‘safe’
   for most nations, communities, ecosystems and sectors and poses
   significant risks to natural and human systems as compared to the
   current warming of 1°C (high confidence). {Cross- Chapter Box 12 in
   Chapter 5} The impacts of 1.5°C of warming would disproportionately
   affect disadvantaged and vulnerable populations through food
   insecurity, higher food prices, income losses, lost livelihood
   opportunities, adverse health impacts and population displacements
   (medium evidence, high agreement). {5.2.1} Some of the worst impacts on
   sustainable development are expected to be felt among agricultural and
   coastal dependent livelihoods, indigenous people, children and the
   elderly, poor labourers, poor urban dwellers in African cities, and
   people and ecosystems in the Arctic and Small Island Developing States
   (SIDS) (medium evidence, high agreement). {5.2.1, Box 5.3, Chapter 3,
   Box 3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4}
     __________________________________________________________________

   Climate Adaptation and Sustainable Development

   Prioritization of sustainable development and meeting the SDGs is
   consistent with efforts to adapt to climate change (high confidence).
   Many strategies for sustainable development enable transformational
   adaptation for a 1.5°C warmer world, provided attention is paid to
   reducing poverty in all its forms and to promoting equity and
   participation in decision-making (medium evidence, high agreement). As
   such, sustainable development has the potential to significantly reduce
   systemic vulnerability, enhance adaptive capacity, and promote
   livelihood security for poor and disadvantaged populations (high
   confidence). {5.3.1}

   Synergies between adaptation strategies and the SDGs are expected to
   hold true in a 1.5°C warmer world, across sectors  and contexts (medium
   evidence, medium agreement). Synergies between adaptation and
   sustainable development are significant for agriculture and health,
   advancing SDGs 1 (extreme poverty), 2 (hunger), 3 (healthy lives and
   well-being) and 6 (clean water) (robust evidence, medium agreement).
   {5.3.2} Ecosystem- and community- based adaptation, along with the
   incorporation of indigenous and local knowledge, advances synergies
   with SDGs 5 (gender equality), 10 (reducing inequalities) and 16
   (inclusive societies), as exemplified in drylands and the Arctic (high
   evidence, medium agreement). {5.3.2, Box 5.1, Cross-Chapter Box 10 in
   Chapter 4}

   Adaptation  strategies  can  result in   trade-offs   with   and among
   the SDGs (medium evidence, high agreement). Strategies that advance one
   SDG may create negative consequences for other SDGs, for instance SDGs
   3 (health) versus 7 (energy consumption) and agricultural adaptation
   and SDG 2 (food security) versus SDGs 3 (health), 5 (gender equality),
   6 (clean water), 10 (reducing inequalities), 14 (life below water) and
   15 (life on the land) (medium evidence, medium agreement). {5.3.2}

   Pursuing  place-specific  adaptation  pathways   towards   a   1.5°C
   warmer world has the potential for significant positive outcomes for
   well-being in countries at all levels of development (medium evidence,
   high agreement). Positive outcomes emerge when adaptation pathways (i)
   ensure a diversity of adaptation options based on people’s values and
   the trade-offs they consider acceptable, (ii) maximize synergies with
   sustainable development through inclusive, participatory and
   deliberative processes, and (iii) facilitate equitable transformation.
   Yet such pathways would be difficult to achieve without redistributive
   measures to overcome path dependencies, uneven power structures, and
   entrenched social inequalities (medium evidence, high agreement).

Mitigation and Sustainable Development

   The deployment of mitigation options consistent with 1.5°C pathways
   leads to multiple synergies across a range of sustainable development
   dimensions. At  the  same  time,  the rapid pace and magnitude of
   change that would be required to limit warming to 1.5°C, if not
   carefully managed, would lead to trade-offs with some sustainable
   development dimensions (high confidence). The number of synergies
   between mitigation response options and sustainable development exceeds
   the number of trade- offs in energy demand and supply sectors;
   agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU); and for oceans (very
   high confidence). {Figure 5.2, Table 5.2 available at the end of the
   chapter} The 1.5°C pathways indicate robust synergies, particularly for
   the SDGs 3 (health), 7 (energy), 12 (responsible consumption and
   production) and 14 (oceans) (very high confidence). {5.4.2, Figure 5.3}
   For SDGs 1 (poverty), 2 (hunger), 6 (water) and 7 (energy), there is a
   risk of trade-offs or negative side effects from stringent mitigation
   actions compatible with 1.5°C of warming (medium evidence, high
   agreement). {5.4.2}

   Appropriately designed mitigation actions to reduce energy demand can
   advance multiple SDGs simultaneously. Pathways compatible with 1.5°C
   that feature low energy demand show the most pronounced synergies and
   the lowest number of trade-offs with respect to sustainable development
   and the SDGs (very high confidence). Accelerating energy efficiency in
   all sectors has synergies with SDGs 7 (energy), 9 (industry, innovation
   and infrastructure), 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 12
   (responsible consumption and production), 16 (peace, justice and strong
   institutions), and 17 (partnerships for the goals) (robust evidence,
   high agreement). {5.4.1, Figure 5.2, Table 5.2} Low-demand pathways,
   which would reduce or completely avoid the reliance on bioenergy with
   carbon capture and storage (BECCS) in 1.5°C pathways, would result in
   significantly reduced pressure on food security, lower food prices and
   fewer people at risk of hunger (medium evidence, high agreement).
   {5.4.2, Figure 5.3}

   The impacts of carbon dioxide removal options on SDGs depend on the
   type of options and the scale of deployment (high confidence). If
   poorly implemented, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) options such as
   bioenergy, BECCS and AFOLU would lead to trade- offs. Appropriate
   design and implementation requires considering local people’s needs,
   biodiversity and other sustainable development dimensions (very high
   confidence). {5.4.1.3, Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3}

   The design of the mitigation portfolios and policy instruments     to
   limit warming to 1.5°C will largely determine the overall synergies and
   trade-offs between mitigation and sustainable development (very high
   confidence). Redistributive policies that shield the poor and
   vulnerable can resolve trade-offs for a range of SDGs (medium evidence,
   high agreement). Individual mitigation options are associated with both
   positive and negative interactions with the SDGs (very high
   confidence). {5.4.1} However, appropriate choices across the mitigation
   portfolio can help to maximize positive side effects while minimizing
   negative side effects (high confidence). {5.4.2, 5.5.2} Investment
   needs for complementary policies resolving trade-offs with a range of
   SDGs are only a small fraction of the overall mitigation investments in
   1.5°C pathways (medium evidence, high agreement). {5.4.2, Figure 5.4}
   Integration of mitigation with adaptation and sustainable development
   compatible with 1.5°C warming requires a systems perspective (high
   confidence). {5.4.2, 5.5.2}

   Mitigation consistent with 1.5°C of warming  create  high  risks  for
   sustainable development in countries with high dependency  on fossil
   fuels for revenue and employment generation (high confidence). These
   risks are caused by the reduction of global demand affecting mining
   activity and export revenues and challenges to rapidly decrease high
   carbon intensity of the domestic economy (robust evidence, high
   agreement). {5.4.1.2, Box 5.2} Targeted policies that promote
   diversification of the economy and the energy sector could ease this
   transition (medium evidence, high agreement). {5.4.1.2, Box 5.2}

Sustainable Development Pathways to 1.5°C

   Sustainable development broadly supports and often  enables  the
   fundamental societal and systems  transformations that  would be
   required for limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre- industrial levels
   (high confidence). Simulated pathways that feature the most sustainable
   worlds (e.g., Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSP) 1) are associated
   with relatively lower mitigation and adaptation challenges and limit
   warming to 1.5°C at comparatively lower mitigation costs. In contrast,
   development pathways with high fragmentation, inequality and poverty
   (e.g., SSP3) are associated with comparatively higher mitigation and
   adaptation challenges. In such pathways, it is not possible to limit
   warming to 1.5°C for the vast majority of the integrated assessment
   models (medium evidence, high agreement). {5.5.2} In all SSPs,
   mitigation costs substantially increase in 1.5°C pathways compared to
   2°C pathways. No pathway in the literature integrates or achieves all
   17 SDGs (high confidence). {5.5.2} Real-world experiences at the
   project level show that the actual integration between adaptation,
   mitigation and sustainable development is challenging as it requires
   reconciling trade-offs across sectors and spatial scales (very high
   confidence). {5.5.1}

   Without   societal   transformation   and    rapid    implementation
   of  ambitious  greenhouse  gas   reduction   measures,  pathways to
   limiting warming to 1.5°C and achieving sustainable development  will
   be  exceedingly  difficult,  if   not   impossible, to achieve (high
   confidence). The potential for pursuing such pathways differs between
   and within nations and regions, due to different development
   trajectories, opportunities and challenges (very high confidence).
   {5.5.3.2, Figure 5.1} Limiting warming to 1.5°C would require all
   countries and non-state actors to strengthen their contributions
   without delay. This could be achieved through sharing efforts based on
   bolder and more committed cooperation, with support for those with the
   least capacity to adapt, mitigate and transform (medium evidence, high
   agreement). {5.5.3.1, 5.5.3.2} Current efforts towards reconciling
   low-carbon trajectories and reducing inequalities, including those that
   avoid difficult trade-offs associated with transformation, are
   partially successful yet demonstrate notable obstacles (medium
   evidence, medium agreement). {5.5.3.3, Box 5.3, Cross-Chapter Box 13 in
   this chapter}

   Social justice and equity are core aspects of climate-resilient
   development pathways for transformational social change. Addressing
   challenges  and  widening  opportunities  between and  within
   countries  and  communities  would  be  necessary   to achieve
   sustainable  development  and  limit  warming  to  1.5°C, without
   making the poor and disadvantaged worse  off (high confidence).
   Identifying and navigating inclusive and socially acceptable pathways
   towards low-carbon, climate-resilient futures is a challenging yet
   important endeavour, fraught with moral, practical and political
   difficulties and inevitable trade-offs (very high confidence). {5.5.2,
   5.5.3.3, Box 5.3} It entails deliberation and  problem-solving
   processes to negotiate societal values, well-being, risks and
   resilience and to determine what is desirable and fair, and to whom
   (medium evidence, high agreement). Pathways that encompass joint,
   iterative planning and transformative visions, for instance in Pacific
   SIDS like Vanuatu and in urban contexts, show potential for liveable
   and sustainable futures (high confidence). {5.5.3.1, 5.5.3.3, Figure
   5.5, Box 5.3, Cross-Chapter Box 13 in this chapter}

   The fundamental societal and systemic changes to achieve sustainable
   development, eradicate poverty and reduce inequalities while limiting
   warming to 1.5°C would require  meeting a set of institutional, social,
   cultural, economic and technological conditions (high confidence). The
   coordination and monitoring of policy actions across sectors and
   spatial scales is essential to support sustainable development in 1.5°C
   warmer conditions (very high confidence). {5.6.2, Box 5.3} External
   funding and technology transfer better support these efforts when they
   consider recipients’ context-specific needs (medium evidence, high
   agreement). {5.6.1} Inclusive processes can facilitate transformations
   by ensuring participation, transparency, capacity building and
   iterative social learning (high confidence). {5.5.3.3, Cross-Chapter
   Box 13, 5.6.3} Attention to power asymmetries and unequal opportunities
   for development, among and within countries, is key to adopting
   1.5°C-compatible development pathways that benefit all populations
   (high confidence). {5.5.3, 5.6.4, Box 5.3} Re-examining individual and
   collective values could help spur urgent, ambitious and cooperative
   change (medium evidence, high agreement). {5.5.3, 5.6.5}

   For the IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing
   Climate (SROCC), more than 100 scientists from more than 30 countries
   are assessing the latest scientific knowledge about the physical
   science basis and impacts of climate change on ocean, coastal, polar
   and mountain ecosystems, and the human communities that depend on them.
   Their vulnerabilities as well as adaptation capacities are also
   evaluated. Options for achieving climate-resilient development pathways
   will be presented.

   SROCC is prepared under the joint scientific leadership of Working
   Group I and Working Group II, with operational support from the Working
   Group II Technical Support Unit.

   The IPCC will consider the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere
   in a Changing Climate (SROCC) on 20-23 September 2019 during its 51st
   Session to be held in the Principality of Monaco. The report is due to
   be launched on 25 September 2019.

Authors and Review Editors

   A call for nomination of authors was sent to governments, Observer
   Organizations and IPCC Bureau Members on 5 April 2017. They were asked
   to submit their nominations via their Focal Points by Wednesday, 17 May
   2017 (midnight CEST) using the online portal for submitting
   nominations.

   The IPCC selected the author teams that are now preparing the Special
   Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC). The
   selected experts took on roles of Coordinating Lead Authors and Lead
   Authors – who draft each individual chapter – and Review Editors, who
   ensure that comments by experts and governments are given appropriate
   consideration as the report develops. The teams are working together to
   produce the Special Report, set to be finalized in September 2019.

   The full list of SROCC Coordinating Lead Authors, Lead Authors and
   Review Editors is available on the author database.

   Statistics about author nominations can be accessed on the public
   portal.

History

   The Scientific Steering Committee for the scoping of a special report
   on climate change and the oceans and the cryosphere circulated a
   questionnaire to IPCC Focal Points and Observer Organizations on 7
   October 2016. A total number of 44 pre-scoping questionnaire responses
   were submitted. About 100 experts from 40 countries met on 6 – 9
   December 2016 in Monaco and prepared a draft outline. More information
   is available in the report of the scoping meeting.

   At its 43rd Session (Nairobi, Kenya, 11 – 13 April 2016), the IPCC
   Panel decided to prepare a special report on climate change and the
   oceans and the cryosphere.

   During its 45th Session (Guadalajara, Mexico, 28 – 31 March 2017), the
   IPCC Panel approved the outline of the Special Report on the Ocean and
   Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC).

   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will consider the
   Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate
   (SROCC) on 20-23 September 2019 during its 51st Session to be held in
   the Principality of Monaco. The report is due to be launched on 25
   September 2019.

Land is a Critical Resource, IPCC report says

   GENEVA, Aug 8 – Land is already under growing human pressure and
   climate change is adding to these pressures. At the same time, keeping
   global warming to well below 2ºC can be achieved only by reducing
   greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors including land and food, the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said in its latest
   report on Thursday.

   The IPCC, the world body for assessing the state of scientific
   knowledge related to climate change, its impacts and potential future
   risks, and possible response options, saw the Summary for Policymakers
   of the Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) approved by
   the  world’s governments on Wednesday in Geneva, Switzerland.

   It will be a key scientific input into forthcoming climate and
   environment negotiations, such as the Conference of the Parties of the
   UN Convention to Combat Desertification (COP14) in New Delhi, India in
   September and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference
   (COP25) in Santiago, Chile, in December.

   “Governments challenged the IPCC to take the first ever comprehensive
   look at the whole land-climate system. We did this through many
   contributions from experts and governments worldwide. This is the first
   time in IPCC report history that a majority of authors – 53% – are from
   developing countries,” said Hoesung Lee, Chair of the IPCC.

   This report shows that better land management can contribute to
   tackling climate change, but is not the only solution. Reducing
   greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors is essential if global
   warming is to be kept to well below 2ºC, if not 1.5^oC.

   In 2015, governments backed the Paris Agreement goal of strengthening
   the global response to climate change by holding the increase in the
   global average temperature to well below 2ºC above pre-industrial
   levels and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5ºC.

   Land must remain productive to maintain food security as the population
   increases and the negative impacts of climate change on vegetation
   increase. This means there are limits to the contribution of land to
   addressing climate change, for instance through the cultivation of
   energy crops and afforestation. It also takes time for trees and soils
   to store carbon effectively. Bioenergy needs to be carefully managed to
   avoid risks to food security, biodiversity and land degradation.
   Desirable outcomes will depend on locally appropriate policies and
   governance systems.


   Land is a critical resource

   Climate Change and Land finds that the world is best placed to tackle
   climate change when there is an overall focus on sustainability.

   “Land plays an important role in the climate system,” said Jim Skea,
   Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group III.

   “Agriculture, forestry and other types of land use account for 23% of
   human greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time natural land processes
   absorb carbon dioxide equivalent to almost a third of carbon dioxide
   emissions from fossil fuels and industry,” he said.

   The report shows how managing land resources sustainably can help
   address climate change, said Hans-Otto Pörtner, Co-Chair of IPCC
   Working Group II.

   “Land already in use could feed the world in a changing climate and
   provide biomass for renewable energy, but early, far-reaching action
   across several areas is required” he said.  “Also for the conservation
   and restoration of ecosystems and biodiversity.”


   Desertification and land degradation

   When land is degraded, it becomes less productive, restricting what can
   be grown and reducing the soil’s ability to absorb carbon. This
   exacerbates climate change, while climate change in turn exacerbates
   land degradation in many different ways.

   “The choices we make about sustainable land management can help reduce
   and in some cases reverse these adverse impacts,” said Kiyoto Tanabe,
   Co-Chair of the Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

   “In a future with more intensive rainfall the risk of soil erosion on
   croplands increases, and sustainable land management is a way to
   protect communities from the detrimental impacts of this soil erosion
   and landslides. However there are limits to what can be done, so in
   other cases degradation might be irreversible,” he said.

   Roughly 500 million people live in areas that experience
   desertification. Drylands and areas that experience desertification are
   also more vulnerable to climate change and extreme events including
   drought, heatwaves, and dust storms, with an increasing global
   population providing further pressure.

   The report sets out options to tackle land degradation, and prevent or
   adapt to further climate change. It also examines potential impacts
   from different levels of global warming.

   “New knowledge shows an increase in risks from dryland water scarcity,
   fire damage, permafrost degradation and food system instability, even
   for global warming of around 1.5°C,” said Valérie Masson-Delmotte,
   Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group I.

   “Very high risks related to permafrost degradation and food system
   instability are identified at 2°C of global warming,” she said.


   Food security

   Coordinated action to address climate change can simultaneously improve
   land, food security and nutrition, and help to end hunger.  The report
   highlights that climate change is affecting all four pillars of food
   security: availability (yield and production), access (prices and
   ability to obtain food), utilization (nutrition and cooking), and
   stability (disruptions to availability).

   “Food security will be increasingly affected by future climate change
   through yield declines – especially in the tropics – increased prices,
   reduced nutrient quality, and supply chain disruptions,” said
   Priyadarshi Shukla, Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group III.

   “We will see different effects in different countries, but there will
   be more drastic impacts on low-income countries in Africa, Asia, Latin
   America and the Caribbean,” he said.

   The report records that about one third of food produced is lost or
   wasted. Causes of food loss and waste differ substantially between
   developed and developing countries, as well as between regions.
   Reducing this loss and waste would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and
   improve food security.

   “Some dietary choices require more land and water, and cause more
   emissions of heat-trapping gases than others,” said Debra Roberts,
   Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group II.

   “Balanced diets  featuring plant-based foods, such as coarse grains,
   legumes, fruits and vegetables, and animal-sourced food produced
   sustainably in low greenhouse gas emission systems, present major
   opportunities for adaptation to and limiting climate change,” she said.

   The report finds that there are ways to manage risks and reduce
   vulnerabilities in land and the food system.

   Risk management can enhance communities’ resilience to extreme events,
   which has an impact on food systems..  This can be the result of
   dietary changes or ensuring a variety of crops to prevent further land
   degradation and increase resilience to extreme or varying weather.

   Reducing inequalities, improving incomes, and ensuring equitable access
   to food so that some regions (where land cannot provide adequate food)
   are not disadvantaged, are other ways to adapt to the negative effects
   of climate change.  There are also methods to manage and share risks,
   some of which are already available, such as early warning systems.

   An overall focus on sustainability coupled with early action offers the
   best chances to tackle climate change. This would entail low population
   growth and reduced inequalities, improved nutrition and lower food
   waste.

   This could enable a more resilient food system and make more land
   available for bioenergy, while still protecting forests and natural
   ecosystems. However, without early action in these areas, more land
   would be required for bioenergy, leading to challenging decisions about
   future land-use and food security.

   “Policies that support sustainable land management, ensure the supply
   of food for vulnerable populations, and keep carbon in the ground while
   reducing greenhouse gas emissions are important,” said Eduardo Calvo,
   Co-Chair of the Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.


   Land and climate change responses

   Policies that are outside the land and energy domains, such as on
   transport and environment , can also make a critical difference to
   tackling climate change. Acting early is more cost-effective as it
   avoids losses.

   “There are things we are already doing. We are using technologies and
   good practices, but they do need to be scaled up and used in other
   suitable places that they are not being used in now,” said Panmao Zhai,
   Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group I.

   “There is real potential here through more sustainable land use,
   reducing over-consumption and waste of food, eliminating the clearing
   and burning of forests, preventing over-harvesting of fuelwood, and
   reducing greenhouse gas emissions, thus helping to address land related
   climate change issues,” he said.

   Notes for editors


   Special Report on Climate Change and Land

   Climate Change and Land is the second in a series of Special Reports to
   be produced in the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Cycle. The report was
   prepared under the joint scientific leadership of all three IPCC
   Working Groups in cooperation with the Task Force on National
   Greenhouse Gas Inventories, with support from the Working Group III
   Technical Support Unit.

   The Summary for Policymakers presents the key findings of the Special
   Report, based on the assessment of the available scientific, technical
   and socio-economic literature relevant to climate change and land.

   The Summary for Policymakers of the Special Report on Climate Change
   and Land (SRCCL) is available at https://ipcc.ch/report/srccl. A Fact
   Sheet and Headline Statements are available at www.ipcc.ch.


   Key statistics of the Special Report on Climate Change and Land

   The report was prepared by 107 experts from 52 countries who acted as:
     * 15 Coordinating Lead Authors
     * 71 Lead Authors
     * 21 Review Editors

   This is the first IPCC report in which a majority of the authors (53%)
   are from developing countries.  Women account for 40% of the
   Coordinating Lead Authors.

   The author team drew on the contributions of 96 Contributing Authors;
   included over 7,000 cited references in the report; and considered a
   total of 28,275 expert and government review comments (First Order
   Draft 10,401; Second Order Draft 14,831; Final Government Draft:
   3,043).


   What is the IPCC?

   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the UN body for
   assessing the science related to climate change. It was established by
   the United Nations Environment Programme (UN Environment) and the World
   Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1988 to provide policymakers with
   regular scientific assessments concerning climate change, its
   implications and potential future risks, as well as to put forward
   adaptation and mitigation strategies. In the same year, the UN General
   Assembly endorsed the action by the WMO and UNEP in jointly
   establishing the IPCC. It has 195 member states.

   IPCC assessments provide governments, at all levels, with scientific
   information that they can use to develop climate policies. IPCC
   assessments are a key input into the international negotiations to
   tackle climate change. IPCC reports are drafted and reviewed in several
   stages, thus guaranteeing objectivity and transparency.

   The IPCC assesses the thousands of scientific papers published each
   year to tell policymakers what we know and don’t know about the risks
   related to climate change. The IPCC identifies where there is agreement
   in the scientific community, where there are differences of opinion,
   and where further research is needed. It does not conduct its own
   research.

   To produce its reports, the IPCC mobilizes hundreds of scientists.
   These scientists and officials are drawn from diverse backgrounds. Only
   a dozen permanent staff work in the IPCC’s Secretariat.

   The IPCC has three working groups: Working Group I, dealing with the
   physical science basis of climate change; Working Group II, dealing
   with impacts, adaptation and vulnerability; and Working Group III,
   dealing with the mitigation of climate change. It also has a Task Force
   on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories that develops methodologies for
   estimating emissions and removals.

   IPCC Assessment Reports consist of contributions from each of the three
   working groups and a Synthesis Report. Special Reports undertake an
   assessment of cross-disciplinary issues that span more than one working
   group and are shorter and more focused than the main assessments.


   Sixth Assessment Cycle

   At its 41^st Session in February 2015, the IPCC decided to produce a
   Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). At its 42^nd Session in October 2015 it
   elected a new Bureau that would oversee the work on this report and
   Special Reports to be produced in the assessment cycle. At its 43rd
   Session in April 2016, it decided to produce three Special Reports, a
   Methodology Report and AR6.

   The IPCC decided at its 43^rd session in Nairobi, Kenya (11-13 April
   2016) to prepare the report after member states and observer
   organizations were asked to submit views on potential themes for
   Special Reports during the current Sixth Assessment Report cycle. Nine
   clusters were considered on different themes, including land, cities,
   and oceans.  The Special Report on Climate Change and Land represents
   the second largest cluster and covers 7 proposals from member states
   and observer organizations that related to land.

   Last year the IPCC released the Special Report on Global Warming of
   1.5°C, which looked at global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial
   levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways in the
   context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate
   change. In September 2019 the IPCC will release the Special Report on
   the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate.

   It delivered a Methodology Report, the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC
   Guidelines for  National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, in May 2019. The
   2019 Refinement provides an updated scientific basis for supporting the
   preparation of national greenhouse gas inventories. Over 280 scientists
   and experts worked on the 2019 Refinement to produce many changes to
   the general guidance as well as methodologies for four sectors: energy;
   industrial processes and product use; agriculture, forestry and other
   land use; and waste.

   The AR6 Synthesis Report will be finalized in the first half of 2022,
   following the three working group contributions to AR6 in 2021.

   The IPCC will prepare a special report on climate change and cities in
   the next assessment cycle. All reports in the current cycle include a
   stronger integration of the assessment on the impacts of climate change
   on cities and their unique adaptation and mitigation opportunities.

The IPCC was created to provide policymakers with regular scientific
assessments on climate change, its implications and potential future risks,
as well as to put forward adaptation and mitigation options.

   Through its assessments, the IPCC determines the state of knowledge on
   climate change. It identifies where there is agreement in the
   scientific community on topics related to climate change, and where
   further research is needed. The reports are drafted and reviewed in
   several stages, thus guaranteeing objectivity and transparency.  The
   IPCC does not conduct its own research.

   IPCC reports are neutral, policy-relevant but not policy-prescriptive.
    The assessment reports are a key input into the international
   negotiations to tackle climate change. Created by the United Nations
   Environment Programme (UN Environment) and the World Meteorological
   Organization (WMO) in 1988, the IPCC  has 195 Member countries. In the
   same year, the UN General Assembly endorsed the action by WMO and UNEP
   in jointly establishing the IPCC.

   its impacts and future risks, and options for reducing the rate at
   which climate change is taking place. It also produces Special Reports
   on topics agreed to by its member governments, as well as Methodology
   Reports that provide guidelines for the preparation of greenhouse gas
   inventories. Learn more about the reports here.

Activities

   The main activity of the IPCC is the preparation of reports assessing
   the state of knowledge of climate change. These include assessment
   reports, special reports and methodology reports. To deliver this work
   programme, the IPCC holds meetings of its government representatives,
   convening as plenary sessions of the Panel or IPCC Working Groups to
   approve, adopt and accept reports. Plenary Sessions of the IPCC also
   determine the IPCC work programme, and other business including its
   budget and outlines of reports. The IPCC Bureau meets regularly to
   provide guidance to the Panel on scientific and technical aspects of
   its work.

   The IPCC organizes scoping meetings of experts and meetings of lead
   authors to prepare reports. It organizes expert meetings and workshops
   on various topics to support its work programme, and publishes the
   proceedings of these meetings.  To communicate its findings and explain
   its work, the IPCC takes part in outreach activities organized by the
   IPCC or hosted by other organizations, and provides speakers to other
   conferences.

   More information on sessions of the IPCC, its Working Groups and the
   Bureau can be found in the Documentation section.

Working Groups and Task Force

   IPCC assessments and special reports are prepared by three Working
   Groups, each looking at a different aspect of the science related to
   climate change: Working Group I (The Physical Science Basis), Working
   Group II (Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability), and Working Group III
   (Mitigation of Climate Change). The IPCC also has a Task Force on
   National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, whose main objective is to develop
   and refine a methodology for the calculation and reporting of national
   greenhouse gas emissions and removals.

   The Working Groups and Task Force handle the preparation of reports,
   selecting and managing the experts that work on them as authors.

   The activities of each Working Group and the Task Force are supported
   by their Technical Support Units (TSU).

Background

   At its 43rd Session (Nairobi, Kenya, 11 – 13 April 2016), the IPCC
   Panel decided to prepare a special report on climate change,
   desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food
   security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems.

   Experts met on 13 – 17 February 2017 in Dublin, Ireland to prepare a
   draft outline for the report.

   At its 45th Session (Guadalajara, Mexico, 28 – 31 March 2017), the
   Panel approved the outline for Climate Change and Land: an IPCC special
   report on climate change, desertification, land degradation,
   sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes
   in terrestrial ecosystems.

   The Special Report was developed under the joint scientific leadership
   of Working Groups I, II, III in cooperation with the Task Force on
   National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, and supported by the Working Group
   III Technical Support Unit.

Authors and Review Editors

   107 experts from 52 countries were selected as Coordinating Lead
   Authors and Lead Authors – who are working on  each individual chapter
   – and Review Editors, who ensured that comments by experts and
   governments were given appropriate consideration as the report
   developed.

   40% of the Coordinating Lead Authors are women.  53% of the authors are
   from developing countries, making this the first IPCC report to have
   more authors from developing countries than from developed
   countries.  The full list of Coordinating Lead Authors, Lead Authors
   and Review Editors is here.

   A call for nomination of authors was sent to governments, observer
   organizations and IPCC Bureau Members on 5 April 2017. Graphics that
   provide background information about the nominees are available here

Pre-Scoping

   The Steering Committee for the Special Report on climate change,
   desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food
   security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems
   circulated a questionnaire to IPCC Focal Points and Observer
   Organizations ahead of the Scoping Meeting in February 2017 to get
   input on the structure and contents of the report. You can download the
   questionnaire and stakeholder consultation report here.

Scoping

   A scoping meeting for the Special Report on climate change,
   desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food
   security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems was held
   on 13 – 17 February 2017 in Dublin, Ireland. The meeting resulted in
   a draft scoping paper describing the objectives and an annotated
   outline of the Special Report as well as the process and timeline for
   its preparation.

   All the details of the scoping meeting are available in the scoping
   meeting report.

Chapter 1

Executive Summary

   This chapter frames the context, knowledge-base and assessment
   approaches used to understand the impacts of 1.5°C global warming above
   pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission
   pathways, building on the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), in the
   context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate
   change, sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty.

   Human-induced warming reached approximately 1°C (likely between 0.8°C
   and 1.2°C) above pre-industrial levels in 2017, increasing at 0.2°C
   (likely between 0.1°C and 0.3°C) per decade (high confidence). Global
   warming is defined in this report as an increase in combined surface
   air and sea surface temperatures averaged over the globe and over a
   30-year period. Unless otherwise specified, warming is expressed
   relative to the period 1850–1900, used as an approximation of
   pre-industrial temperatures in AR5. For periods shorter than 30 years,
   warming refers to the estimated average temperature over the 30 years
   centred on that shorter period, accounting for the impact of any
   temperature fluctuations or trend within those 30 years. Accordingly,
   warming from pre- industrial levels to the decade 2006–2015 is assessed
   to be 0.87°C (likely between 0.75°C and 0.99°C). Since 2000, the
   estimated level of human-induced warming has been equal to the level of
   observed warming with a likely range of ±20% accounting for uncertainty
   due to contributions from solar and volcanic activity over the
   historical period (high confidence). {1.2.1}

   Warming greater than the global average has already been experienced in
   many regions and seasons, with higher average warming over land than
   over the ocean (high confidence). Most land regions are experiencing
   greater warming than the global average, while most ocean regions are
   warming at a slower rate. Depending on the temperature dataset
   considered, 20–40% of the global human population live in regions that,
   by the decade 2006–2015, had already experienced warming of more than
   1.5°C above pre-industrial in at least one season (medium confidence).
   {1.2.1, 1.2.2}

   Past emissions alone are unlikely to raise global-mean temperature to
   1.5°C above pre-industrial levels (medium confidence), but past
   emissions do commit to other changes, such as further sea level rise
   (high confidence). If all anthropogenic emissions (including
   aerosol-related) were reduced to zero immediately, any further warming
   beyond the 1°C already experienced would likely be less than 0.5°C over
   the next two to three decades (high confidence), and likely less than
   0.5°C on a century time scale (medium confidence), due to the opposing
   effects of different climate processes and drivers. A warming greater
   than 1.5°C is therefore not geophysically unavoidable: whether it will
   occur depends on future rates of emission reductions. {1.2.3, 1.2.4}

   1.5°C emission pathways are defined as those that, given current
   knowledge of the climate response, provide a one- in-two to
   two-in-three chance of warming either remaining below 1.5°C or
   returning to 1.5°C by around 2100 following an overshoot. Overshoot
   pathways are characterized by the peak magnitude of the overshoot,
   which may have implications for impacts. All 1.5°C pathways involve
   limiting cumulative emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases, including
   carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, and substantial reductions in other
   climate forcers (high confidence). Limiting cumulative emissions
   requires either reducing net global emissions of long-lived greenhouse
   gases to zero before the cumulative limit is reached, or net negative
   global emissions (anthropogenic removals) after the limit is exceeded.
   {1.2.3, 1.2.4, Cross-Chapter Boxes 1 and 2}

   This report assesses projected impacts at a global average warming of
   1.5°C and higher levels of warming. Global warming of 1.5°C is
   associated with global average surface temperatures fluctuating
   naturally on either side of 1.5°C, together with warming substantially
   greater than 1.5°C in many regions and seasons (high confidence), all
   of which must be considered in the assessment of impacts. Impacts at
   1.5°C of warming also depend on the emission pathway to 1.5°C. Very
   different impacts result from pathways that remain below 1.5°C versus
   pathways that return to 1.5°C after a substantial overshoot, and when
   temperatures stabilize at 1.5°C versus a transient warming past 1.5°C
   (medium confidence). {1.2.3, 1.3}

   Ethical considerations, and the principle of equity in particular, are
   central to this report, recognizing that many of the impacts of warming
   up to and beyond 1.5°C, and some potential impacts of mitigation
   actions required to limit warming to 1.5°C, fall disproportionately on
   the poor and vulnerable (high confidence). Equity has procedural and
   distributive dimensions and requires fairness in burden sharing both
   between generations and between and within nations. In framing the
   objective of holding the increase in the global average temperature
   rise to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue
   efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C, the Paris Agreement associates the
   principle of equity with the broader goals of poverty eradication and
   sustainable development, recognising that effective responses to
   climate change require a global collective effort that may be guided by
   the 2015 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. {1.1.1}

   Climate adaptation refers to the actions taken to manage impacts of
   climate change by reducing vulnerability and exposure to its harmful
   effects and exploiting any potential benefits. Adaptation takes place
   at international, national and local levels. Subnational jurisdictions
   and entities, including urban and rural municipalities, are key to
   developing and reinforcing measures for reducing weather- and
   climate-related risks. Adaptation implementation faces several barriers
   including lack of up-to-date and locally relevant information, lack of
   finance and technology, social values and attitudes, and institutional
   constraints (high confidence). Adaptation is more likely to contribute
   to sustainable development when policies align with mitigation and
   poverty eradication goals (medium confidence). {1.1, 1.4}

   Ambitious mitigation actions are indispensable to limit warming to
   1.5°C while achieving sustainable development and poverty eradication
   (high confidence). Ill-designed responses, however, could pose
   challenges especially – but not exclusively – for countries and regions
   contending with poverty and those requiring significant transformation
   of their energy systems. This report focuses on ‘climate-resilient
   development pathways’, which aim to meet the goals of sustainable
   development, including climate adaptation and mitigation, poverty
   eradication and reducing inequalities. But any feasible pathway that
   remains within 1.5°C involves synergies and trade-offs (high
   confidence). Significant uncertainty remains as to which pathways are
   more consistent with the principle of equity.
   {1.1.1, 1.4}

   Multiple forms of knowledge, including scientific evidence, narrative
   scenarios and prospective pathways, inform the understanding of 1.5°C.
   This report is informed by traditional evidence of the physical climate
   system and associated impacts and vulnerabilities of climate change,
   together with knowledge drawn from the perceptions of risk and the
   experiences of climate impacts and governance systems. Scenarios and
   pathways are used to explore conditions enabling goal-oriented futures
   while recognizing the significance of ethical considerations, the
   principle of equity, and the societal transformation needed. {1.2.3,
   1.5.2}

   There is no single answer to the question of whether it is feasible to
   limit warming to 1.5°C and adapt to the consequences. Feasibility is
   considered in this report as the capacity of a system as a whole to
   achieve a specific outcome. The global transformation that would be
   needed to limit warming to 1.5°C requires enabling conditions that
   reflect the links, synergies and trade-offs between mitigation,
   adaptation and sustainable development. These enabling conditions are
   assessed across many dimensions of feasibility – geophysical,
   environmental-ecological, technological, economic, socio-cultural and
   institutional – that may be considered through the unifying lens of the
   Anthropocene, acknowledging profound, differential but increasingly
   geologically significant human influences on the Earth system as a
   whole. This framing also emphasises the global interconnectivity of
   past, present and future human–environment relations, highlighting the
   need and opportunities for integrated responses to achieve the goals of
   the Paris Agreement. {1.1, Cross-Chapter Box 1}

Chapter 2

Executive Summary

   This chapter assesses mitigation pathways consistent with limiting
   warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. In doing so, it explores
   the following key questions: What role do CO[2] and non-CO[2] emissions
   play? {2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.6} To what extent do 1.5°C pathways involve
   overshooting and returning below 1.5°C during the 21st century? {2.2,
   2.3} What are the implications for transitions in energy, land use and
   sustainable development? {2.3, 2.4, 2.5} How do policy frameworks
   affect the ability to limit warming to 1.5°C? {2.3, 2.5} What are the
   associated knowledge gaps? {2.6}

   The assessed pathways describe integrated, quantitative evolutions of
   all emissions over the 21st century associated with global energy and
   land use and the world economy. The assessment is contingent upon
   available integrated assessment literature and model assumptions, and
   is complemented by other studies with different scope, for example,
   those focusing on individual sectors. In recent years, integrated
   mitigation studies have improved the characterizations of mitigation
   pathways. However, limitations remain, as climate damages, avoided
   impacts, or societal co-benefits of the modelled transformations remain
   largely unaccounted for, while concurrent rapid technological changes,
   behavioural aspects, and uncertainties about input data present
   continuous challenges. (high confidence) {2.1.3, 2.3, 2.5.1, 2.6,
   Technical Annex 2}
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Chances of Limiting Warming to 1.5°C and the Requirements for
   Urgent Action

   Pathways consistent with 1.5°C of warming above pre-industrial levels
   can be identified under a range of assumptions about economic growth,
   technology developments and lifestyles. However, lack of global
   cooperation, lack of governance of the required energy and land
   transformation, and increases in resource-intensive consumption are key
   impediments to achieving 1.5°C pathways. Governance challenges have
   been related to scenarios with high inequality and high population
   growth in the 1.5°C pathway literature. {2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.5}

   Under emissions in line with current pledges under the Paris Agreement
   (known as Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs), global warming
   is expected to surpass 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, even if these
   pledges are supplemented with very challenging increases in the scale
   and ambition of mitigation after 2030 (high confidence). This increased
   action would need to achieve net zero CO[2] emissions in less than 15
   years. Even if this is achieved, temperatures would only be expected to
   remain below the 1.5°C threshold if the actual geophysical response
   ends up being towards the low end of the currently estimated
   uncertainty range. Transition challenges as well as identified
   trade-offs can be reduced if global emissions peak before 2030 and
   marked emissions reductions compared to today are already achieved by
   2030 {2.2, 2.3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4}.

   Limiting warming to 1.5°C depends on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   over the next decades, where lower GHG emissions in 2030 lead to a
   higher chance of keeping peak warming to 1.5°C (high confidence).
   Available pathways that aim for no or limited (less than 0.1°C)
   overshoot of 1.5°C keep GHG emissions in 2030 to 25–30 GtCO[2]e yr^−1
   in 2030 (interquartile range). This contrasts with median estimates for
   current unconditional NDCs of 52–58 GtCO[2]e yr^−1 in 2030. Pathways
   that aim for limiting warming to 1.5°C by 2100 after a temporary
   temperature overshoot rely on large-scale deployment of carbon dioxide
   removal (CDR) measures, which are uncertain and entail clear risks. In
   model pathways with no or limited overshoot of 1.5°C, global net
   anthropogenic CO[2] emissions decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by
   2030 (40–60% interquartile range), reaching net zero around 2050
   (2045–2055 interquartile range).^1 For limiting global warming to below
   2°C with at least 66% probability CO[2] emissions are projected to
   decline by about 25% by 2030 in most pathways (10–30% interquartile
   range) and reach net zero around 2070 (2065–2080 interquartile range).
   {2.2, 2.3.3, 2.3.5, 2.5.3, Cross-Chapter Boxes 6 in Chapter 3 and 9 in
   Chapter 4, 4.3.7}

   Limiting warming to 1.5°C implies reaching net zero CO[2] emissions
   globally around 2050 and concurrent deep reductions in emissions of
   non-CO[2] forcers, particularly methane (high confidence). Such
   mitigation pathways are characterized by energy-demand reductions,
   decarbonization of electricity and other fuels, electrification of
   energy end use, deep reductions in agricultural emissions, and some
   form of CDR with carbon storage on land or sequestration in geological
   reservoirs. Low energy demand and low demand for land- and
   GHG-intensive consumption goods facilitate limiting warming to as close
   as possible to 1.5°C. {2.2.2, 2.3.1, 2.3.5, 2.5.1, Cross-Chapter Box 9
   in Chapter 4}.

   In comparison to a 2°C limit, the transformations required to limit
   warming to 1.5°C are qualitatively similar but more pronounced and
   rapid over the next decades (high confidence). 1.5°C implies very
   ambitious, internationally cooperative policy environments that
   transform both supply and demand (high confidence). {2.3, 2.4, 2.5}

   Policies reflecting a high price on emissions are necessary in models
   to achieve cost-effective 1.5°C pathways (high confidence). Other
   things being equal, modelling studies suggest the global average
   discounted marginal abatement costs for limiting warming to 1.5°C being
   about 3–4 times higher compared to 2°C over the 21st century, with
   large variations across models and socio-economic and policy
   assumptions. Carbon pricing can be imposed directly or implicitly by
   regulatory policies. Policy instruments, like technology policies or
   performance standards, can complement explicit carbon pricing in
   specific areas. {2.5.1, 2.5.2, 4.4.5}

   Limiting warming to 1.5°C requires a marked shift in investment
   patterns (medium confidence). Additional annual average energy-related
   investments for the period 2016 to 2050 in pathways limiting warming to
   1.5°C compared to pathways without new climate policies beyond those in
   place today (i.e., baseline) are estimated to be around 830 billion
   USD2010 (range of 150 billion to 1700 billion USD2010 across six
   models). Total energy-related investments increase by about 12% (range
   of 3% to 24%) in 1.5°C pathways relative to 2°C pathways. Average
   annual investment in low-carbon energy technologies and energy
   efficiency are upscaled by roughly a factor of six (range of factor of
   4 to 10) by 2050 compared to 2015, overtaking fossil investments
   globally by around 2025 (medium confidence). Uncertainties and
   strategic mitigation portfolio choices affect the magnitude and focus
   of required investments. {2.5.2}
     __________________________________________________________________

   Future Emissions in 1.5°C Pathways

   Mitigation requirements can be quantified using carbon budget
   approaches that relate cumulative CO[2] emissions to global mean
   temperature increase. Robust physical understanding underpins this
   relationship, but uncertainties become increasingly relevant as a
   specific temperature limit is approached. These uncertainties relate to
   the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE),
   non-CO[2] emissions, radiative forcing and response, potential
   additional Earth system feedbacks (such as permafrost thawing), and
   historical emissions and temperature. {2.2.2, 2.6.1}

   Cumulative CO[2] emissions are kept within a budget by reducing global
   annual CO[2] emissions to net zero. This assessment suggests a
   remaining budget of about 420 GtCO[2 ]for a two-thirds chance of
   limiting warming to 1.5°C, and of about 580 GtCO[2] for an even chance
   (medium confidence). The remaining carbon budget is defined here as
   cumulative CO[2] emissions from the start of 2018 until the time of net
   zero global emissions for global warming defined as a change in global
   near-surface air temperatures. Remaining budgets applicable to 2100
   would be approximately 100 GtCO[2] lower than this to account for
   permafrost thawing and potential methane release from wetlands in the
   future, and more thereafter. These estimates come with an additional
   geophysical uncertainty of at least ±400 GtCO[2], related to non-CO[2]
   response and TCRE distribution. Uncertainties in the level of historic
   warming contribute ±250 GtCO[2]. In addition, these estimates can vary
   by ±250 GtCO[2] depending on non-CO[2] mitigation strategies as found
   in available pathways. {2.2.2, 2.6.1}

   Staying within a remaining carbon budget of 580 GtCO[2] implies that
   CO[2] emissions reach carbon neutrality in about 30 years, reduced to
   20 years for a 420 GtCO[2] remaining carbon budget (high confidence).
   The ±400 GtCO[2] geophysical uncertainty range surrounding a carbon
   budget translates into a variation of this timing of carbon neutrality
   of roughly ±15–20 years. If emissions do not start declining in the
   next decade, the point of carbon neutrality would need to be reached at
   least two decades earlier to remain within the same carbon budget.
   {2.2.2, 2.3.5}

   Non-CO[2] emissions contribute to peak warming and thus affect the
   remaining carbon budget. The evolution of methane and sulphur dioxide
   emissions strongly influences the chances of limiting warming to 1.5°C.
   In the near-term, a weakening of aerosol cooling would add to future
   warming, but can be tempered by reductions in methane emissions (high
   confidence). Uncertainty in radiative forcing estimates (particularly
   aerosol) affects carbon budgets and the certainty of pathway
   categorizations. Some non-CO[2] forcers are emitted alongside CO[2],
   particularly in the energy and transport sectors, and can be largely
   addressed through CO[2] mitigation. Others require specific measures,
   for example, to target agricultural nitrous oxide (N[2]O) and methane
   (CH[4]), some sources of black carbon, or hydrofluorocarbons (high
   confidence). In many cases, non-CO[2] emissions reductions are similar
   in 2°C pathways, indicating reductions near their assumed maximum
   potential by integrated assessment models. Emissions of N[2]O and NH[3]
   increase in some pathways with strongly increased bioenergy demand.
   {2.2.2, 2.3.1, 2.4.2, 2.5.3}
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Role of Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR)

   All analysed pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited
   overshoot use CDR to some extent to neutralize emissions from sources
   for which no mitigation measures have been identified and, in most
   cases, also to achieve net negative emissions to return global warming
   to 1.5°C following a peak (high confidence). The longer the delay in
   reducing CO[2] emissions towards zero, the larger the likelihood of
   exceeding 1.5°C, and the heavier the implied reliance on net negative
   emissions after mid-century to return warming to 1.5°C (high
   confidence). The faster reduction of net CO[2] emissions in 1.5°C
   compared to 2°C pathways is predominantly achieved by measures that
   result in less CO[2] being produced and emitted, and only to a smaller
   degree through additional CDR. Limitations on the speed, scale and
   societal acceptability of CDR deployment also limit the conceivable
   extent of temperature overshoot. Limits to our understanding of how the
   carbon cycle responds to net negative emissions increase the
   uncertainty about the effectiveness of CDR to decline temperatures
   after a peak. {2.2, 2.3, 2.6, 4.3.7}

   CDR deployed at scale is unproven, and reliance on such technology is a
   major risk in the ability to limit warming to 1.5°C. CDR is needed less
   in pathways with particularly strong emphasis on energy efficiency and
   low demand. The scale and type of CDR deployment varies widely across
   1.5°C pathways, with different consequences for achieving sustainable
   development objectives (high confidence). Some pathways rely more on
   bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), while others rely
   more on afforestation, which are the two CDR methods most often
   included in integrated pathways. Trade-offs with other sustainability
   objectives occur predominantly through increased land, energy, water
   and investment demand. Bioenergy use is substantial in 1.5°C pathways
   with or without BECCS due to its multiple roles in decarbonizing energy
   use. {2.3.1, 2.5.3, 2.6.3, 4.3.7}

   Properties of Energy and Land Transitions in 1.5°C Pathways

   The share of primary energy from renewables increases while coal usage
   decreases across pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited
   overshoot (high confidence). By 2050, renewables (including bioenergy,
   hydro, wind, and solar, with direct-equivalence method) supply a share
   of 52–67% (interquartile range) of primary energy in 1.5°C pathways
   with no or limited overshoot; while the share from coal decreases to
   1–7% (interquartile range), with a large fraction of this coal use
   combined with carbon capture and storage (CCS). From 2020 to 2050 the
   primary energy supplied by oil declines in most pathways (−39 to −77%
   interquartile range). Natural gas changes by −13% to −62%
   (interquartile range), but some pathways show a marked increase albeit
   with widespread deployment of CCS. The overall deployment of CCS varies
   widely across 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot, with
   cumulative CO[2] stored through 2050 ranging from zero up to 300
   GtCO[2](minimum–maximum range), of which zero up to 140 GtCO[2] is
   stored from biomass. Primary energy supplied by bioenergy ranges from
   40–310 EJ yr^−1 in 2050 (minimum-maximum range), and nuclear from 3–66
   EJ yr^−1 (minimum–maximum range). These ranges reflect both
   uncertainties in technological development and strategic mitigation
   portfolio choices. {2.4.2}

   1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot include a rapid decline in
   the carbon intensity of electricity and an increase in electrification
   of energy end use (high confidence). By 2050, the carbon intensity of
   electricity decreases to −92 to +11 gCO[2] MJ^−1 (minimum–maximum
   range) from about 140 gCO[2] MJ^−1 in 2020, and electricity covers
   34–71% (minimum–maximum range) of final energy across 1.5°C pathways
   with no or limited overshoot from about 20% in 2020. By 2050, the share
   of electricity supplied by renewables increases to 59–97%
   (minimum-maximum range) across 1.5°C pathways with no or limited
   overshoot. Pathways with higher chances of holding warming to below
   1.5°C generally show a faster decline in the carbon intensity of
   electricity by 2030 than pathways that temporarily overshoot 1.5°C.
   {2.4.1, 2.4.2, 2.4.3}

   Transitions in global and regional land use are found in all pathways
   limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, but
   their scale depends on the pursued mitigation portfolio (high
   confidence). Pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C with no or
   limited overshoot project a 4 million km^2 reduction to a 2.5 million
   km^2 increase of non-pasture agricultural land for food and feed crops
   and a 0.5–11 million km^2 reduction of pasture land, to be converted
   into 0-6 million km^2 of agricultural land for energy crops and a 2
   million km^2 reduction to 9.5 million km^2 increase in forests by 2050
   relative to 2010 (medium confidence). Land-use transitions of similar
   magnitude can be observed in modelled 2°C pathways (medium confidence).
   Such large transitions pose profound challenges for sustainable
   management of the various demands on land for human settlements, food,
   livestock feed, fibre, bioenergy, carbon storage, biodiversity and
   other ecosystem services (high confidence). {2.3.4, 2.4.4}
     __________________________________________________________________

   Demand-Side Mitigation and Behavioural Changes

   Demand-side measures are key elements of 1.5°C pathways. Lifestyle
   choices lowering energy demand and the land- and GHG-intensity of food
   consumption can further support achievement of 1.5°C pathways (high
   confidence). By 2030 and 2050, all end-use sectors (including building,
   transport, and industry) show marked energy demand reductions in
   modelled 1.5°C pathways, comparable and beyond those projected in 2°C
   pathways. Sectoral models support the scale of these reductions.
   {2.3.4, 2.4.3, 2.5.1}
     __________________________________________________________________

   Links between 1.5°C Pathways and Sustainable Development

   Choices about mitigation portfolios for limiting warming to 1.5°C can
   positively or negatively impact the achievement of other societal
   objectives, such as sustainable development (high confidence). In
   particular, demand-side and efficiency measures, and lifestyle choices
   that limit energy, resource, and GHG-intensive food demand support
   sustainable development (medium confidence). Limiting warming to 1.5°C
   can be achieved synergistically with poverty alleviation and improved
   energy security and can provide large public health benefits through
   improved air quality, preventing millions of premature deaths. However,
   specific mitigation measures, such as bioenergy, may result in
   trade-offs that require consideration. {2.5.1, 2.5.2, 2.5.3}

   Why is it necessary and even vital to maintain the global temperature
   increase below 1.5°C versus higher levels? Adaptation will be less
   difficult. Our world will suffer less negative impacts on intensity and
   frequency of extreme events, on resources, ecosystems, biodiversity,
   food security, cities, tourism, and carbon removal.

Chapter 3

Executive Summary

   This chapter builds on findings of AR5 and assesses new scientific
   evidence of changes in the climate system and the associated impacts on
   natural and human systems, with a specific focus on the magnitude and
   pattern of risks linked for global warming of 1.5°C above temperatures
   in the pre-industrial period. Chapter 3 explores observed impacts and
   projected risks to a range of natural and human systems, with a focus
   on how risk levels change from 1.5°C to 2°C of global warming. The
   chapter also revisits major categories of risk (Reasons for Concern,
   RFC) based on the assessment of new knowledge that has become available
   since AR5.

    1.5°C and 2°C Warmer Worlds

   The global climate has changed relative to the pre-industrial period,
   and there are multiple lines of evidence that these changes have had
   impacts on organisms and ecosystems, as well as on human systems and
   well-being (high confidence). The increase in global mean surface
   temperature (GMST), which reached 0.87°C in 2006–2015 relative to
   1850–1900, has increased the frequency and magnitude of impacts (high
   confidence), strengthening evidence of how an increase in GMST of 1.5°C
   or more could impact natural and human systems (1.5°C versus 2°C).
   {3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, Cross-Chapter Boxes 6, 7 and 8 in this chapter}

   Human-induced global warming has already caused multiple observed
   changes in the climate system (high confidence). Changes include
   increases in both land and ocean temperatures, as well as more frequent
   heatwaves in most land regions (high confidence). There is also (high
   confidence) global warming has resulted in an increase in the frequency
   and duration of marine heatwaves. Further, there is substantial
   evidence that human-induced global warming has led to an increase in
   the frequency, intensity and/or amount of heavy precipitation events at
   the global scale (medium confidence), as well as an increased risk of
   drought in the Mediterranean region (medium confidence). {3.3.1, 3.3.2,
   3.3.3, 3.3.4, Box 3.4}

   Trends in intensity and frequency of some climate and weather extremes
   have been detected over time spans during which about 0.5°C of global
   warming occurred (medium confidence). This assessment is based on
   several lines of evidence, including attribution studies for changes in
   extremes since 1950. {3.2, 3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4}

   Several regional changes in climate are assessed to occur with global
   warming up to 1.5°C as compared to pre-industrial levels, including
   warming of extreme temperatures in many regions (high confidence),
   increases in frequency, intensity and/or amount of heavy precipitation
   in several regions (high confidence), and an increase in intensity or
   frequency of droughts in some regions (medium confidence). {3.3.1,
   3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4, Table 3.2}

   There is no single ‘1.5°C warmer world’ (high confidence). In addition
   to the overall increase in GMST, it is important to consider the size
   and duration of potential overshoots in temperature. Furthermore, there
   are questions on how the stabilization of an increase in GMST of 1.5°C
   can be achieved, and how policies might be able to influence the
   resilience of human and natural systems, and the nature of regional and
   subregional risks. Overshooting poses large risks for natural and human
   systems, especially if the temperature at peak warming is high, because
   some risks may be long-lasting and irreversible, such as the loss of
   some ecosystems (high confidence). The rate of change for several types
   of risks may also have relevance, with potentially large risks in the
   case of a rapid rise to overshooting temperatures, even if a decrease
   to 1.5°C can be achieved at the end of the 21st century or later
   (medium confidence). If overshoot is to be minimized, the remaining
   equivalent CO[2] budget available for emissions is very small, which
   implies that large, immediate and unprecedented global efforts to
   mitigate greenhouse gases are required (high confidence). {3.2, 3.6.2,
   Cross-Chapter Box 8 in this chapter}

   Robust^1 global differences in temperature means and extremes are
   expected if global warming reaches 1.5°C versus 2°C above the
   pre-industrial levels (high confidence). For oceans, regional surface
   temperature means and extremes are projected to be higher at 2°C
   compared to 1.5°C of global warming (high confidence). Temperature
   means and extremes are also projected to be higher at 2°C compared to
   1.5°C in most land regions, with increases being 2–3 times greater than
   the increase in GMST projected for some regions (high confidence).
   Robust increases in temperature means and extremes are also projected
   at 1.5°C compared to present-day values (high confidence) {3.3.1,
   3.3.2}. There are decreases in the occurrence of cold extremes, but
   substantial increases in their temperature, in particular in regions
   with snow or ice cover (high confidence) {3.3.1}.

   Climate models project robust^2 differences in regional climate between
   present-day and global warming up to 1.5°C^3, and between 1.5°C and
   2°C^4 (high confidence), depending on the variable and region in
   question (high confidence). Large, robust and widespread differences
   are expected for temperature extremes (high confidence). Regarding hot
   extremes, the strongest warming is expected to occur at mid-latitudes
   in the warm season (with increases of up to 3°C for 1.5°C of global
   warming, i.e., a factor of two) and at high latitudes in the cold
   season (with increases of up to 4.5°C at 1.5°C of global warming, i.e.,
   a factor of three) (high confidence). The strongest warming of hot
   extremes is projected to occur in central and eastern North America,
   central and southern Europe, the Mediterranean region (including
   southern Europe, northern Africa and the Near East), western and
   central Asia, and southern Africa (medium confidence). The number of
   exceptionally hot days are expected to increase the most in the
   tropics, where interannual temperature variability is lowest; extreme
   heatwaves are thus projected to emerge earliest in these regions, and
   they are expected to already become widespread there at 1.5°C global
   warming (high confidence). Limiting global warming to 1.5°C instead of
   2°C could result in around 420 million fewer people being frequently
   exposed to extreme heatwaves, and about 65 million fewer people being
   exposed to exceptional heatwaves, assuming constant vulnerability
   (medium confidence). {3.3.1, 3.3.2, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in this
   chapter}

   Limiting global warming to 1.5°C would limit risks of increases in
   heavy precipitation events on a global scale and in several regions
   compared to conditions at 2°C global warming (medium confidence). The
   regions with the largest increases in heavy precipitation events for
   1.5°C to 2°C global warming include: several high-latitude regions
   (e.g. Alaska/western Canada, eastern Canada/ Greenland/Iceland,
   northern Europe and northern Asia); mountainous regions (e.g.,Tibetan
   Plateau); eastern Asia (including China and Japan); and eastern North
   America (medium confidence). Tropical cyclones are projected to
   decrease in frequency but with an increase in the number of very
   intense cyclones (limited evidence, low confidence). Heavy
   precipitation associated with tropical cyclones is projected to be
   higher at 2°C compared to 1.5°C of global warming (medium confidence).
   Heavy precipitation, when aggregated at a global scale, is projected to
   be higher at 2°C than at 1.5°C of global warming (medium confidence)
   {3.3.3, 3.3.6}

   Limiting global warming to 1.5°C is expected to substantially reduce
   the probability of extreme drought, precipitation deficits, and risks
   associated with water availability (i.e., water stress) in some regions
   (medium confidence). In particular, risks associated with increases in
   drought frequency and magnitude are projected to be substantially
   larger at 2°C than at 1.5°C in the Mediterranean region (including
   southern Europe, northern Africa and the Near East) and southern Africa
   (medium confidence). {3.3.3, 3.3.4, Box 3.1, Box 3.2}

   Risks to natural and human systems are expected to be lower at 1.5°C
   than at 2°C of global warming (high confidence). This difference is due
   to the smaller rates and magnitudes of climate change associated with a
   1.5°C temperature increase, including lower frequencies and intensities
   of temperature-related extremes. Lower rates of change enhance the
   ability of natural and human systems to adapt, with substantial
   benefits for a wide range of terrestrial, freshwater, wetland, coastal
   and ocean ecosystems (including coral reefs) (high confidence), as well
   as food production systems, human health, and tourism (medium
   confidence), together with energy systems and transportation (low
   confidence). {3.3.1, 3.4}

   Exposure to multiple and compound climate-related risks is projected to
   increase between 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming with greater
   proportions of people both exposed and susceptible to poverty in Africa
   and Asia (high confidence). For global warming from 1.5°C to 2°C, risks
   across energy, food, and water sectors could overlap spatially and
   temporally, creating new – and exacerbating current – hazards,
   exposures, and vulnerabilities that could affect increasing numbers of
   people and regions (medium confidence). Small island states and
   economically disadvantaged populations are particularly at risk (high
   confidence). {3.3.1, 3.4.5.3, 3.4.5.6, 3.4.11, 3.5.4.9, Box 3.5}

   Global warming of 2°C would lead to an expansion of areas with
   significant increases in runoff, as well as those affected by flood
   hazard, compared to conditions at 1.5°C (medium confidence). Global
   warming of 1.5°C would also lead to an expansion of the global land
   area with significant increases in runoff (medium confidence) and an
   increase in flood hazard in some regions (medium confidence) compared
   to present-day conditions. {3.3.5}

   The probability of a sea-ice-free Arctic Ocean^5  during summer is
   substantially higher at 2°C compared to 1.5°C of global warming (medium
   confidence). Model simulations suggest that at least one sea-ice-free
   Arctic summer is expected every 10 years for global warming of 2°C,
   with the frequency decreasing to one sea-ice-free Arctic summer every
   100 years under 1.5°C (medium confidence). An intermediate temperature
   overshoot will have no long- term consequences for Arctic sea ice
   coverage, and hysteresis is not expected (high confidence). {3.3.8,
   3.4.4.7}

   Global mean sea level rise (GMSLR) is projected to be around 0.1 m
   (0.04 – 0.16 m) less by the end of the 21st century in a 1.5°C warmer
   world compared to a 2°C warmer world (medium confidence). Projected
   GMSLR for 1.5°C of global warming has an indicative range of 0.26 –
   0.77m, relative to 1986–2005, (medium confidence). A smaller sea level
   rise could mean that up to 10.4 million fewer people (based on the 2010
   global population and assuming no adaptation) would be exposed to the
   impacts of sea level rise globally in 2100 at 1.5°C compared to at 2°C.
   A slower rate of sea level rise enables greater opportunities for
   adaptation (medium confidence). There is high confidence that sea level
   rise will continue beyond 2100. Instabilities exist for both the
   Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which could result in multi-meter
   rises in sea level on time scales of century to millennia. There is
   (medium confidence) that these instabilities could be triggered at
   around 1.5°C to 2°C of global warming. {3.3.9, 3.4.5, 3.6.3}

   The ocean has absorbed about 30% of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide,
   resulting in ocean acidification and changes to carbonate chemistry
   that are unprecedented for at least the last 65 million years (high
   confidence). Risks have been identified for the survival,
   calcification, growth, development and abundance of a broad range of
   marine taxonomic groups, ranging from algae to fish, with substantial
   evidence of predictable trait-based sensitivities (high confidence).
   There are multiple lines of evidence that ocean warming and
   acidification corresponding to 1.5°C of global warming would impact a
   wide range of marine organisms and ecosystems, as well as sectors such
   as aquaculture and fisheries (high confidence). {3.3.10, 3.4.4}

   Larger risks are expected for many regions and systems for global
   warming at 1.5°C, as compared to today, with adaptation required now
   and up to 1.5°C. However, risks would be larger at 2°C of warming and
   an even greater effort would be needed for adaptation to a temperature
   increase of that magnitude (high confidence). {3.4, Box 3.4, Box 3.5,
   Cross-Chapter Box 6 in this chapter}

   Future risks at 1.5°C of global warming will depend on the mitigation
   pathway and on the possible occurrence of a transient overshoot (high
   confidence). The impacts on natural and human systems would be greater
   if mitigation pathways temporarily overshoot 1.5°C and return to 1.5°C
   later in the century, as compared to pathways that stabilize at 1.5°C
   without an overshoot (high confidence). The size and duration of an
   overshoot would also affect future impacts (e.g., irreversible loss of
   some ecosystems) (high confidence). Changes in land use resulting from
   mitigation choices could have impacts on food production and ecosystem
   diversity. {3.6.1, 3.6.2, Cross-Chapter Boxes 7 and 8 in this chapter}

   Climate Change Risks for Natural and Human systems

   Terrestrial and Wetland Ecosystems

   Risks of local species losses and, consequently, risks of extinction
   are much less in a 1.5°C versus a 2°C warmer world (high confidence).
   The number of species projected to lose over half of their climatically
   determined geographic range at 2°C global warming (18% of insects, 16%
   of plants, 8% of vertebrates) is projected to be reduced to 6% of
   insects, 8% of plants and 4% of vertebrates at 1.5°C warming (medium
   confidence). Risks associated with other biodiversity-related factors,
   such as forest fires, extreme weather events, and the spread of
   invasive species, pests and diseases, would also be lower at 1.5°C than
   at 2°C of warming (high confidence), supporting a greater persistence
   of ecosystem services.
   {3.4.3, 3.5.2}

   Constraining global warming to 1.5°C, rather than to 2°C and higher, is
   projected to have many benefits for terrestrial and wetland ecosystems
   and for the preservation of their services to humans (high confidence).
   Risks for natural and managed ecosystems are higher on drylands
   compared to humid lands. The global terrestrial land area projected to
   be affected by ecosystem transformations (13%, interquartile range
   8–20%) at 2°C is approximately halved at 1.5°C global warming to 4%
   (interquartile range 2–7%) (medium confidence). Above 1.5°C, an
   expansion of desert terrain and vegetation would occur in the
   Mediterranean biome (medium confidence), causing changes unparalleled
   in the last 10,000 years (medium confidence). {3.3.2.2, 3.4.3.2,
   3.4.3.5, 3.4.6.1, 3.5.5.10, Box 4.2}

   Many impacts are projected to be larger at higher latitudes, owing to
   mean and cold-season warming rates above the global average (medium
   confidence). High-latitude tundra and boreal forest are particularly at
   risk, and woody shrubs are already encroaching into tundra (high
   confidence) and will proceed with further warming. Constraining warming
   to 1.5°C would prevent the thawing of an estimated permafrost area of
   1.5 to 2.5 million km^2 over centuries compared to thawing under 2°C
   (medium confidence). {3.3.2, 3.4.3, 3.4.4}

   Ocean Ecosystems

   Ocean ecosystems are already experiencing large-scale changes, and
   critical thresholds are expected to be reached at 1.5°C and higher
   levels of global warming (high confidence). In the transition to 1.5°C
   of warming, changes to water temperatures are expected to drive some
   species (e.g., plankton, fish) to relocate to higher latitudes and
   cause novel ecosystems to assemble (high confidence). Other ecosystems
   (e.g., kelp forests, coral reefs) are relatively less able to move,
   however, and are projected to experience high rates of mortality and
   loss (very high confidence). For example, multiple lines of evidence
   indicate that the majority (70–90%) of warm water (tropical) coral
   reefs that exist today will disappear even if global warming is
   constrained to 1.5°C (very high confidence). {3.4.4, Box 3.4}

   Current ecosystem services from the ocean are expected to be reduced at
   1.5°C of global warming, with losses being even greater at 2°C of
   global warming (high confidence). The risks of declining ocean
   productivity, shifts of species to higher latitudes, damage to
   ecosystems (e.g., coral reefs, and mangroves, seagrass and other
   wetland ecosystems), loss of fisheries productivity (at low latitudes),
   and changes to ocean chemistry (e.g., acidification, hypoxia and dead
   zones) are projected to be substantially lower when global warming is
   limited to 1.5°C (high confidence). {3.4.4, Box 3.4}

   Water Resources

   The projected frequency and magnitude of floods and droughts in some
   regions are smaller under 1.5°C than under 2°C of warming (medium
   confidence). Human exposure to increased flooding is projected to be
   substantially lower at 1.5°C compared to 2°C of global warming,
   although projected changes create regionally differentiated risks
   (medium confidence). The differences in the risks among regions are
   strongly influenced by local socio-economic conditions (medium
   confidence). {3.3.4, 3.3.5, 3.4.2}

   Risks of water scarcity are projected to be greater at 2°C than at
   1.5°C of global warming in some regions (medium confidence). Depending
   on future socio-economic conditions, limiting global warming to 1.5°C,
   compared to 2°C, may reduce the proportion of the world population
   exposed to a climate change-induced increase in water stress by up to
   50%, although there is considerable variability between regions (medium
   confidence). Regions with particularly large benefits could include the
   Mediterranean and the Caribbean (medium confidence). Socio-economic
   drivers, however, are expected to have a greater influence on these
   risks than the changes in climate (medium confidence). {3.3.5, 3.4.2,
   Box 3.5}

   Land Use, Food Security and Food Production Systems

   Limiting global warming to 1.5°C, compared with 2°C, is projected to
   result in smaller net reductions in yields of maize, rice, wheat, and
   potentially other cereal crops, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa,
   Southeast Asia, and Central and South America; and in the
   CO[2]-dependent nutritional quality of rice and wheat (high
   confidence). A loss of 7–10% of rangeland livestock globally is
   projected for approximately 2°C of warming, with considerable economic
   consequences for many communities and regions (medium confidence).
   {3.4.6, 3.6, Box 3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in this chapter}

   Reductions in projected food availability are larger at 2°C than at
   1.5°C of global warming in the Sahel, southern Africa, the
   Mediterranean, central Europe and the Amazon (medium confidence). This
   suggests a transition from medium to high risk of regionally
   differentiated impacts on food security between 1.5°C and 2°C (medium
   confidence). Future economic and trade environments and their response
   to changing food availability (medium confidence) are important
   potential adaptation options for reducing hunger risk in low- and
   middle-income countries. {Cross-Chapter Box 6 in this chapter}

   Fisheries and aquaculture are important to global food security but are
   already facing increasing risks from ocean warming and acidification
   (medium confidence). These risks are projected to increase at 1.5°C of
   global warming and impact key organisms such as fin fish and bivalves
   (e.g., oysters), especially at low latitudes (medium confidence).
   Small-scale fisheries in tropical regions, which are very dependent on
   habitat provided by coastal ecosystems such as coral reefs, mangroves,
   seagrass and kelp forests, are expected to face growing risks at 1.5°C
   of warming because of loss of habitat (medium confidence). Risks of
   impacts and decreasing food security are projected to become greater as
   global warming reaches beyond 1.5°C and both ocean warming and
   acidification increase, with substantial losses likely for coastal
   livelihoods and industries (e.g., fisheries and aquaculture) (medium to
   high confidence). {3.4.4, 3.4.5, 3.4.6, Box 3.1, Box 3.4, Box 3.5,
   Cross-Chapter Box 6 in this chapter}

   Land use and land-use change emerge as critical features of virtually
   all mitigation pathways that seek to limit global warming to 1.5°C
   (high confidence). Most least-cost mitigation pathways to limit peak or
   end-of-century warming to 1.5°C make use of carbon dioxide removal
   (CDR), predominantly employing significant levels of bioenergy with
   carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and/or afforestation and
   reforestation (AR) in their portfolio of mitigation measures (high
   confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 7 in this chapter}

   Large-scale deployment of BECCS and/or AR would have a far-reaching
   land and water footprint (high confidence). Whether this footprint
   would result in adverse impacts, for example on biodiversity or food
   production, depends on the existence and effectiveness of measures to
   conserve land carbon stocks, measures to limit agricultural expansion
   in order to protect natural ecosystems, and the potential to increase
   agricultural productivity (medium agreement). In addition, BECCS and/or
   AR would have substantial direct effects on regional climate through
   biophysical feedbacks, which are generally not included in Integrated
   Assessments Models (high confidence). {3.6.2, Cross-Chapter Boxes 7 and
   8 in this chapter}

   The impacts of large-scale CDR deployment could be greatly reduced if a
   wider portfolio of CDR options were deployed, if a holistic policy for
   sustainable land management were adopted, and if increased mitigation
   efforts were employed to strongly limit the demand for land, energy and
   material resources, including through lifestyle and dietary changes
   (medium confidence). In particular, reforestation could be associated
   with significant co-benefits if implemented in a manner than helps
   restore natural ecosystems (high confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 7 in
   this chapter}

   Human Health, Well-Being, Cities and Poverty

   Any increase in global temperature (e.g., +0.5°C) is projected to
   affect human health, with primarily negative consequences (high
   confidence). Lower risks are projected at 1.5°C than at 2°C for
   heat-related morbidity and mortality (very high confidence), and for
   ozone-related mortality if emissions needed for ozone formation remain
   high (high confidence). Urban heat islands often amplify the impacts of
   heatwaves in cities (high confidence). Risks for some vector-borne
   diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever are projected to increase
   with warming from 1.5°C to 2°C, including potential shifts in their
   geographic range (high confidence). Overall for vector- borne diseases,
   whether projections are positive or negative depends on the disease,
   region and extent of change (high confidence). Lower risks of
   undernutrition are projected at 1.5°C than at 2°C (medium confidence).
   Incorporating estimates of adaptation into projections reduces the
   magnitude of risks (high confidence). {3.4.7, 3.4.7.1, 3.4.8, 3.5.5.8}

   Global warming of 2°C is expected to pose greater risks to urban areas
   than global warming of 1.5°C (medium confidence). The extent of risk
   depends on human vulnerability and the effectiveness of adaptation for
   regions (coastal and non-coastal), informal settlements and
   infrastructure sectors (such as energy, water and transport) (high
   confidence). {3.4.5, 3.4.8}

   Poverty and disadvantage have increased with recent warming (about 1°C)
   and are expected to increase for many populations as average global
   temperatures increase from 1°C to 1.5°C and higher (medium confidence).
   Outmigration in agricultural- dependent communities is positively and
   statistically significantly associated with global temperature (medium
   confidence). Our understanding of the links of 1.5°C and 2°C of global
   warming to human migration are limited and represent an important
   knowledge gap. {3.4.10, 3.4.11, 5.2.2, Table 3.5}

   Key Economic Sectors and Services

   Risks to global aggregated economic growth due to climate change
   impacts are projected to be lower at 1.5°C than at 2°C by the end of
   this century (medium confidence). {3.5.2, 3.5.3} The largest reductions
   in economic growth at 2°C compared to 1.5°C of warming are projected
   for low- and middle-income countries and regions (the African
   continent, Southeast Asia, India, Brazil and Mexico) (low to medium
   confidence). Countries in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere
   subtropics are projected to experience the largest impacts on economic
   growth due to climate change should global warming increase from 1.5°C
   to 2°C (medium confidence). {3.5} Global warming has already affected
   tourism, with increased risks projected under 1.5°C of warming in
   specific geographic regions and for seasonal tourism including sun,
   beach and snow sports destinations (very high confidence). Risks will
   be lower for tourism markets that are less climate sensitive, such as
   gaming and large hotel-based activities (high confidence). Risks for
   coastal tourism, particularly in subtropical and tropical regions, will
   increase with temperature-related degradation (e.g., heat extremes,
   storms) or loss of beach and coral reef assets (high confidence).
   {3.3.6, 3.4.4.12, 3.4.9.1, Box 3.4}

   Small Islands, and Coastal and Low-lying areas

   Small islands are projected to experience multiple inter- related risks
   at 1.5°C of global warming that will increase with warming of 2°C and
   higher levels (high confidence). Climate hazards at 1.5°C are projected
   to be lower compared to those at 2°C (high confidence). Long-term risks
   of coastal flooding and impacts on populations, infrastructures and
   assets (high confidence), freshwater stress (medium confidence), and
   risks across marine ecosystems (high confidence) and critical sectors
   (medium confidence) are projected to increase at 1.5°C compared to
   present-day levels and increase further at 2°C, limiting adaptation
   opportunities and increasing loss and damage (medium confidence).
   Migration in small islands (internally and internationally) occurs for
   multiple reasons and purposes, mostly for better livelihood
   opportunities (high confidence) and increasingly owing to sea level
   rise (medium confidence). {3.3.2.2, 3.3.6–9, 3.4.3.2, 3.4.4.2, 3.4.4.5,
   3.4.4.12, 3.4.5.3, 3.4.7.1, 3.4.9.1, 3.5.4.9, Box 3.4, Box 3.5}

   Impacts associated with sea level rise and changes to the salinity of
   coastal groundwater, increased flooding and damage to infrastructure,
   are projected to be critically important in vulnerable environments,
   such as small islands, low-lying coasts and deltas, at global warming
   of 1.5°C and 2°C (high confidence). Localized subsidence and changes to
   river discharge can potentially exacerbate these effects. Adaptation is
   already happening (high confidence) and will remain important over
   multi-centennial time scales. {3.4.5.3, 3.4.5.4, 3.4.5.7, 5.4.5.4, Box
   3.5}

   Existing and restored natural coastal ecosystems may be effective in
   reducing the adverse impacts of rising sea levels and intensifying
   storms by protecting coastal and deltaic regions (medium confidence).
   Natural sedimentation rates are expected to be able to offset the
   effect of rising sea levels, given the slower rates of sea level rise
   associated with 1.5°C of warming (medium confidence). Other feedbacks,
   such as landward migration of wetlands and the adaptation of
   infrastructure, remain important (medium confidence). {3.4.4.12,
   3.4.5.4, 3.4.5.7}

   Increased Reasons for Concern

   There are multiple lines of evidence that since AR5 the assessed levels
   of risk increased for four of the five Reasons for Concern (RFCs) for
   global warming levels of up to 2°C (high confidence). The risk
   transitions by degrees of global warming are now: from high to very
   high between 1.5°C and 2°C for RFC1 (Unique and threatened systems)
   (high confidence); from moderate to high risk between 1°C and 1.5°C for
   RFC2 (Extreme weather events) (medium confidence); from moderate to
   high risk between 1.5°C and 2°C for RFC3 (Distribution of impacts)
   (high confidence); from moderate to high risk between 1.5°C and 2.5°C
   for RFC4 (Global aggregate impacts) (medium confidence); and from
   moderate to high risk between 1°C and 2.5°C for RFC5 (Large-scale
   singular events) (medium confidence). {3.5.2}
    1. The category ‘Unique and threatened systems’ (RFC1) display a
       transition from high to very high risk which is now located between
       1.5°C and 2°C of global warming as opposed to at 2.6°C of global
       warming in AR5, owing to new and multiple lines of evidence for
       changing risks for coral reefs, the Arctic and biodiversity in
       general (high confidence). {3.5.2.1}
    2. In ‘Extreme weather events’ (RFC2), the transition from moderate to
       high risk is now located between 1.0°C and 1.5°C of global warming,
       which is very similar to the AR5 assessment but is projected with
       greater confidence (medium confidence). The impact literature
       contains little information about the potential for human society
       to adapt to extreme weather events, and hence it has not been
       possible to locate the transition from ‘high’ to ‘very high’ risk
       within the context of assessing impacts at 1.5°C versus 2°C of
       global warming. There is thus low confidence in the level at which
       global warming could lead to very high risks associated with
       extreme weather events in the context of this report. {3.5}
    3. With respect to the ‘Distribution of impacts’ (RFC3) a transition
       from moderate to high risk is now located between 1.5°C and 2°C of
       global warming, compared with between 1.6°C and 2.6°C global
       warming in AR5, owing to new evidence about regionally
       differentiated risks to food security, water resources, drought,
       heat exposure and coastal submergence (high confidence). {3.5}
    4. In ‘global aggregate impacts’ (RFC4) a transition from moderate to
       high levels of risk is now located between 1.5°C and 1.5°C of
       global warming, as opposed to at 3.6°C of warming in AR5, owing to
       new evidence about global aggregate economic impacts and risks to
       Earth’s biodiversity (medium confidence). {3.5}
    5. Finally, ‘large-scale singular events’ (RFC5), moderate risk is now
       located at 1°C of global warming and high risk is located at 2.5°C
       of global warming, as opposed to at 1.6°C (moderate risk) and
       around 4°C (high risk) in AR5, because of new observations and
       models of the West Antarctic ice sheet (medium confidence). {3.3.9,
       3.5.2, 3.6.3}

Chapter 4

Executive Summary

   Limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels would require
   transformative systemic change, integrated with sustainable
   development. Such change would require the upscaling and acceleration
   of the implementation of far- reaching, multilevel and cross-sectoral
   climate mitigation and addressing barriers. Such systemic change would
   need to be linked to complementary adaptation actions, including
   transformational adaptation, especially for pathways that temporarily
   overshoot 1.5°C (medium evidence,high agreement) {Chapter 2, Chapter 3,
   4.2.1, 4.4.5, 4.5}. Current national pledges on mitigation and
   adaptation are not enough to stay below the Paris Agreement temperature
   limits and achieve its adaptation goals. While transitions in energy
   efficiency, carbon intensity of fuels, electrification and land-use
   change are underway in various countries, limiting warming to 1.5°C
   will require a greater scale and pace of change to transform energy,
   land, urban and industrial systems globally. {4.3, 4.4, Cross-Chapter
   Box 9 in this Chapter}

   Although multiple communities around the world are demonstrating the
   possibility of implementation consistent with 1.5°C pathways {Boxes
   4.1-4.10}, very few countries, regions, cities, communities or
   businesses can currently make such a claim (high confidence). To
   strengthen the global response, almost all countries would need to
   significantly raise their level of ambition. Implementation of this
   raised ambition would require enhanced institutional capabilities in
   all countries, including building the capability to utilize indigenous
   and local knowledge (medium evidence, high agreement). In developing
   countries and for poor and vulnerable people, implementing the response
   would require financial, technological and other forms of support to
   build capacity, for which additional local, national and international
   resources would need to be mobilized (high confidence). However,
   public, financial, institutional and innovation capabilities currently
   fall short of implementing far-reaching measures at scale in all
   countries (high confidence). Transnational networks that support
   multilevel climate action are growing, but challenges in their scale-up
   remain. {4.4.1, 4.4.2, 4.4.4, 4.4.5, Box 4.1, Box 4.2, Box 4.7}

   Adaptation needs will be lower in a 1.5°C world compared to a 2°C world
   (high confidence) {Chapter 3; Cross-Chapter Box 11 in this chapter}.
   Learning from current adaptation practices and strengthening them
   through adaptive governance {4.4.1}, lifestyle and behavioural change
   {4.4.3} and innovative financing mechanisms {4.4.5} can help their
   mainstreaming within sustainable development practices.Preventing
   maladaptation,drawing on bottom-up approaches
   {Box 4.6} and using indigenous knowledge {Box 4.3} would effectively
   engage and protect vulnerable people and communities. While adaptation
   finance has increased quantitatively, significant further expansion
   would be needed to adapt to 1.5°C. Qualitative gaps in the distribution
   of adaptation finance, readiness to absorb resources, and monitoring
   mechanisms undermine the potential of adaptation finance to reduce
   impacts. {Chapter 3, 4.4.2, 4.4.5, 4.6}
     __________________________________________________________________

   System Transitions

   The energy system transition that would be required to limit global
   warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial conditions is underway in many
   sectors and regions around the world (medium evidence, high agreement).
   The political, economic, social and technical feasibility of solar
   energy, wind energy and electricity storage technologies has improved
   dramatically over the past few years, while that of nuclear energy and
   carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) in the electricity sector have
   not shown similar improvements. {4.3.1}

   Electrification, hydrogen, bio-based feedstocks and substitution, and,
   in several cases, carbon dioxide capture, utilization and storage
   (CCUS), would lead to the deep emissions reductions required in
   energy-intensive industries to limit warming to 1.5°C. However, those
   options are limited by institutional, economic and technical
   constraints, which increase financial risks to many incumbent firms
   (medium evidence, high agreement). Energy efficiency in industry is
   more economically feasible and helps enable industrial system
   transitions but would have to be complemented with greenhouse gas
   (GHG)-neutral processes or carbon dioxide removal (CDR) to make
   energy-intensive industries consistent with 1.5°C (high confidence).
   {4.3.1, 4.3.4}

   Global and regional land-use and ecosystems transitions and associated
   changes in behaviour that would be required to limit warming to 1.5°C
   can enhance future adaptation and land-based agricultural and forestry
   mitigation potential. Such transitions could, however, carry
   consequences for livelihoods that depend on agriculture and natural
   resources {4.3.2, Cross- Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3}. Alterations of
   agriculture and forest systems to achieve mitigation goals could affect
   current ecosystems and their services and potentially threaten food,
   water and livelihood security. While this could limit the social and
   environmental feasibility of land-based mitigation options, careful
   design and implementation could enhance their acceptability and support
   sustainable development objectives (medium evidence, medium agreement).
   {4.3.2, 4.5.3}

   Changing agricultural practices can be an effective climate adaptation
   strategy. A diversity of adaptation options exists, including mixed
   crop-livestock production systems which can be a cost-effective
   adaptation strategy in many global agriculture systems (robust
   evidence, medium agreement). Improving irrigation efficiency could
   effectively deal with changing global water endowments, especially if
   achieved via farmers adopting new behaviours and water- efficient
   practices rather than through large-scale infrastructural interventions
   (medium evidence, medium agreement). Well-designed adaptation processes
   such as community-based adaptation can be effective depending upon
   context and levels of vulnerability. {4.3.2, 4.5.3}

   Improving the efficiency of food production and closing yield gaps have
   the potential to reduce emissions from agriculture, reduce pressure on
   land, and enhance food security and future mitigation potential (high
   confidence). Improving productivity of existing agricultural systems
   generally reduces the emissions intensity of food production and offers
   strong synergies with rural development, poverty reduction and food
   security objectives, but options to reduce absolute emissions are
   limited unless paired with demand-side measures. Technological
   innovation including biotechnology, with adequate safeguards, could
   contribute to resolving current feasibility constraints and expand the
   future mitigation potential of agriculture.
   {4.3.2, 4.4.4}

   Shifts in dietary choices towards foods with lower emissions and
   requirements for land, along with reduced food loss and waste, could
   reduce emissions and increase adaptation options (high confidence).
   Decreasing food loss and waste and changing dietary behaviour could
   result in mitigation and adaptation (high confidence) by reducing both
   emissions and pressure on land, with significant co-benefits for food
   security, human health and sustainable development {4.3.2, 4.4.5,
   4.5.2, 4.5.3, 5.4.2}, but evidence of successful policies to modify
   dietary choices remains limited.

   Mitigation and Adaptation Options and Other Measures

   A mix of mitigation and adaptation options implemented in a
   participatory and integrated manner can enable rapid, systemic
   transitions – in urban and rural areas – that are necessary elements of
   an accelerated transition consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C.
   Such options and changes are most effective when aligned with economic
   and sustainable development, and when local and regional governments
   are supported by national governments {4.3.3, 4.4.1, 4.4.3}. Various
   mitigation options are expanding rapidly across many geographies.
   Although many have development synergies, not all income groups have so
   far benefited from them. Electrification, end-use energy efficiency and
   increased share of renewables, amongst other options, are lowering
   energy use and decarbonizing energy supply in the built environment,
   especially in buildings. Other rapid changes needed in urban
   environments include demotorization and decarbonization of transport,
   including the expansion of electric vehicles, and greater use of
   energy-efficient appliances (medium evidence, high agreement).
   Technological and social innovations can contribute to limiting warming
   to 1.5°C, for example, by enabling the use of smart grids, energy
   storage technologies and general-purpose technologies, such as
   information and communication technology (ICT) that can be deployed to
   help reduce emissions. Feasible adaptation options include green
   infrastructure, resilient water and urban ecosystem services, urban and
   peri-urban agriculture, and adapting buildings and land use through
   regulation and planning (medium evidence, medium to high agreement).
   {4.3.3, 4.4.3, 4.4.4}

   Synergies can be achieved across systemic transitions through several
   overarching adaptation options in rural and urban areas. Investments in
   health, social security and risk sharing and spreading are
   cost-effective adaptation measures with high potential for scaling up
   (medium evidence, medium to high agreement). Disaster risk management
   and education-based adaptation have lower prospects of scalability and
   cost-effectiveness (medium evidence, high agreement) but are critical
   for building adaptive capacity. {4.3.5, 4.5.3}

   Converging adaptation and mitigation options can lead to synergies and
   potentially increase cost-effectiveness, but multiple trade-offs can
   limit the speed of and potential for scaling up. Many examples of
   synergies and trade-offs exist in all sectors and system transitions.
   For instance, sustainable water management (high evidence, medium
   agreement) and investment in green infrastructure (medium evidence,
   high agreement) to deliver sustainable water and environmental services
   and to support urban agriculture are less cost-effective than other
   adaptation options but can help build climate resilience. Achieving the
   governance, finance and social support required to enable these
   synergies and to avoid trade-offs is often challenging, especially when
   addressing multiple objectives, and attempting appropriate sequencing
   and timing of interventions. {4.3.2, 4.3.4, 4.4.1, 4.5.2, 4.5.3, 4.5.4}

   Though CO[2] dominates long-term warming, the reduction of warming
   short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs), such as methane and black carbon,
   can in the short term contribute significantly to limiting warming to
   1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Reductions of black carbon and
   methane would have substantial co-benefits (high confidence), including
   improved health due to reduced air pollution. This, in turn, enhances
   the institutional and socio- cultural feasibility of such actions.
   Reductions of several warming SLCFs are constrained by economic and
   social feasibility (low evidence, high agreement). As they are often
   co-emitted with CO[2], achieving the energy, land and urban transitions
   necessary to limit warming to 1.5°C would see emissions of warming
   SLCFs greatly reduced. {2.3.3.2, 4.3.6}

   Most CDR options face multiple feasibility constraints, which differ
   between options, limiting the potential for any single option to
   sustainably achieve the large-scale deployment required in the
   1.5°C-consistent pathways described in Chapter 2 (high confidence).
   Those 1.5°C pathways typically rely on bioenergy with carbon capture
   and storage (BECCS), afforestation and reforestation (AR), or both, to
   neutralize emissions that are expensive to avoid, or to draw down CO[2]
   emissions in excess of the carbon budget {Chapter 2}. Though BECCS and
   AR may be technically and geophysically feasible, they face partially
   overlapping yet different constraints related to land use. The land
   footprint per tonne of CO[2] removed is higher for AR than for BECCS,
   but given the low levels of current deployment, the speed and scales
   required for limiting warming to 1.5°C pose a considerable
   implementation challenge, even if the issues of public acceptance and
   absence of economic incentives were to be resolved (high agreement,
   medium evidence). The large potential of afforestation and the
   co-benefits if implemented appropriately (e.g., on biodiversity and
   soil quality) will diminish over time, as forests saturate (high
   confidence). The energy requirements and economic costs of direct air
   carbon capture and storage (DACCS) and enhanced weathering remain high
   (medium evidence, medium agreement).At the local scale, soil carbon
   sequestration has co-benefits with agriculture and is cost-effective
   even without climate policy (high confidence). Its potential
   feasibility and cost-effectiveness at the global scale appears to be
   more limited. {4.3.7}

   Uncertainties surrounding solar radiation modification (SRM) measures
   constrain their potential deployment. These uncertainties include:
   technological immaturity; limited physical understanding about their
   effectiveness to limit global warming; and a weak capacity to govern,
   legitimize, and scale such measures. Some recent model-based analysis
   suggests SRM would be effective but that it is too early to evaluate
   its feasibility. Even in the uncertain case that the most adverse
   side-effects of SRM can be avoided, public resistance, ethical concerns
   and potential impacts on sustainable development could render SRM
   economically, socially and institutionally undesirable (low agreement,
   medium evidence). {4.3.8, Cross-Chapter Box 10 in this chapter}
     __________________________________________________________________

   Enabling Rapid and Far-Reaching Change

   The speed of transitions and of technological change required to limit
   warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels has been observed in the
   past within specific sectors and technologies {4.2.2.1}. But the
   geographical and economic scales at which the required rates of change
   in the energy, land, urban, infrastructure and industrial systems would
   need to take place are larger and have no documented historic precedent
   (limited evidence, medium agreement). To reduce inequality and
   alleviate poverty, such transformations would require more planning and
   stronger institutions (including inclusive markets) than observed in
   the past, as well as stronger coordination and disruptive innovation
   across actors and scales of governance. {4.3, 4.4}

   Governance consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C and the political
   economy of adaptation and mitigation can enable and accelerate systems
   transitions,behavioural change,innovation and technology deployment
   (medium evidence, medium agreement). For 1.5°C-consistent actions, an
   effective governance framework would include: accountable multilevel
   governance that includes non- state actors, such as industry, civil
   society and scientific institutions; coordinated sectoral and
   cross-sectoral policies that enable collaborative multi-stakeholder
   partnerships; strengthened global-to-local financial architecture that
   enables greater access to finance and technology; addressing
   climate-related trade barriers; improved climate education and greater
   public awareness; arrangements to enable accelerated behaviour change;
   strengthened climate monitoring and evaluation systems; and reciprocal
   international agreements that are sensitive to equity and the
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). System transitions can be enabled
   by enhancing the capacities of public, private and financial
   institutions to accelerate climate change policy planning and
   implementation, along with accelerated technological innovation,
   deployment and upkeep. {4.4.1, 4.4.2, 4.4.3, 4.4.4}

   Behaviour change and demand-side management can significantly reduce
   emissions, substantially limiting the reliance on CDR to limit warming
   to 1.5°C {Chapter 2, 4.4.3}. Political and financial stakeholders may
   find climate actions more cost- effective and socially acceptable if
   multiple factors affecting behaviour are considered, including aligning
   these actions with people’s core values (medium evidence, high
   agreement). Behaviour- and lifestyle- related measures and demand-side
   management have already led to emission reductions around the world and
   can enable significant future reductions (high confidence). Social
   innovation through bottom-up initiatives can result in greater
   participation in the governance of systems transitions and increase
   support for technologies, practices and policies that are part of the
   global response to limit warming to 1.5°C . {Chapter 2, 4.4.1, 4.4.3,
   Figure 4.3}

   This rapid and far-reaching response required to keep warming below
   1.5°C and enhance the capacity to adapt to climate risks would require
   large increases of investments in low-emission infrastructure and
   buildings, along with a redirection of financial flows towards
   low-emission investments (robust evidence, high agreement). An
   estimated mean annual incremental investment of around 1.5% of global
   gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) for the energy sector is indicated
   between 2016 and 2035, as well as about 2.5% of global GFCF for other
   development infrastructure that could also address SDG implementation.
   Though quality policy design and effective implementation may enhance
   efficiency, they cannot fully substitute for these investments. {2.5.2,
   4.2.1, 4.4.5}

   Enabling this investment requires the mobilization and better
   integration of a range of policy instruments that include the reduction
   of socially inefficient fossil fuel subsidy regimes and innovative
   price and non-price national and international policy instruments.
   These would need to be complemented by de-risking financial instruments
   and the emergence of long-term low-emission assets.These instruments
   would aim to reduce the demand for carbon-intensive services and shift
   market preferences away from fossil fuel-based technology. Evidence and
   theory suggest that carbon pricing alone, in the absence of sufficient
   transfers to compensate their unintended distributional cross- sector,
   cross-nation effects, cannot reach the incentive levels needed to
   trigger system transitions (robust evidence, medium agreement). But,
   embedded in consistent policy packages, they can help mobilize
   incremental resources and provide flexible mechanisms that help reduce
   the social and economic costs of the triggering phase of the transition
   (robust evidence, medium agreement). {4.4.3, 4.4.4, 4.4.5}

   Increasing evidence suggests that a climate-sensitive realignment of
   savings and expenditure towards low-emission, climate-resilient
   infrastructure and services requires an evolution of global and
   national financial systems. Estimates suggest that, in addition to
   climate-friendly allocation of public investments, a potential
   redirection of 5% to 10% of the annual capital revenues^1 is necessary
   for limiting warming to 1.5°C {4.4.5, Table 1 in Box 4.8}. This could
   be facilitated by a change of incentives for private day-to-day
   expenditure and the redirection of savings from speculative and
   precautionary investments towards long- term productive low-emission
   assets and services. This implies the mobilization of institutional
   investors and mainstreaming of climate finance within financial and
   banking system regulation. Access by developing countries to low-risk
   and low-interest finance through multilateral and national development
   banks would have to be facilitated (medium evidence, high agreement).
   New forms of public– private partnerships may be needed with
   multilateral, sovereign and sub-sovereign guarantees to de-risk
   climate-friendly investments, support new business models for
   small-scale enterprises and help households with limited access to
   capital. Ultimately, the aim is to promote a portfolio shift towards
   long-term low-emission assets that would help redirect capital away
   from potentially stranded assets (medium evidence, medium agreement).
   {4.4.5}

   Knowledge gaps around implementing and strengthening the global
   response to climate change would need to be urgently resolved if the
   transition to a 1.5°C world is to become reality. Remaining questions
   include: how much can be realistically expected from innovation and
   behavioural and systemic political and economic changes in improving
   resilience, enhancing adaptation and reducing GHG emissions? How can
   rates of changes be accelerated and scaled up? What is the outcome of
   realistic assessments of mitigation and adaptation land transitions
   that are compliant with sustainable development, poverty eradication
   and addressing inequality? What are life-cycle emissions and prospects
   of early-stage CDR options? How can climate and sustainable development
   policies converge, and how can they be organised within a global
   governance framework and financial system, based on principles of
   justice and ethics (including ‘common but differentiated
   responsibilities and respective capabilities’ (CBDR-RC)), reciprocity
   and partnership? To what extent would limiting warming to 1.5°C require
   a harmonization of macro-financial and fiscal policies, which could
   include financial regulators such as central banks? How can different
   actors and processes in climate governance reinforce each other, and
   hedge against the fragmentation of initiatives? {4.1, 4.3.7, 4.4.1,

Executive Summary

   This chapter takes sustainable development as the starting point and
   focus for analysis. It considers the broad and multifaceted
   bi-directional interplay between sustainable development, including its
   focus on eradicating poverty and reducing inequality in their
   multidimensional aspects, and climate actions in a 1.5°C warmer world.
   These fundamental connections are embedded in the Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs). The chapter also examines synergies and
   trade-offs of adaptation and mitigation options with sustainable
   development and the SDGs and offers insights into possible pathways,
   especially climate-resilient development pathways towards a 1.5°C
   warmer world.

   Sustainable Development, Poverty and Inequality in a 1.5°C Warmer World

   Limiting global warming to 1.5°C rather than 2°C above pre- industrial
   levels would make it markedly easier to achieve many aspects of
   sustainable development, with greater potential to eradicate poverty
   and reduce inequalities (medium evidence, high agreement). Impacts
   avoided with the lower temperature limit could reduce the number of
   people exposed to climate risks and vulnerable to poverty by 62 to 457
   million, and lessen the risks of poor people to experience food and
   water insecurity, adverse health impacts, and economic losses,
   particularly in regions that already face development challenges
   (medium evidence, medium agreement). {5.2.2, 5.2.3} Avoided impacts
   expected to occur between 1.5°C and 2°C warming would also make it
   easier to achieve certain SDGs, such as those that relate to poverty,
   hunger, health, water and sanitation, cities and ecosystems (SDGs 1, 2,
   3, 6, 11, 14 and 15) (medium evidence, high agreement). {5.2.3, Table
   5.2 available at the end of the chapter}

   Compared to current conditions, 1.5°C of global warming would
   nonetheless pose heightened risks to eradicating poverty, reducing
   inequalities and ensuring human and ecosystem well- being (medium
   evidence, high agreement). Warming of 1.5°C is not considered ‘safe’
   for most nations, communities, ecosystems and sectors and poses
   significant risks to natural and human systems as compared to the
   current warming of 1°C (high confidence). {Cross- Chapter Box 12 in
   Chapter 5} The impacts of 1.5°C of warming would disproportionately
   affect disadvantaged and vulnerable populations through food
   insecurity, higher food prices, income losses, lost livelihood
   opportunities, adverse health impacts and population displacements
   (medium evidence, high agreement). {5.2.1} Some of the worst impacts on
   sustainable development are expected to be felt among agricultural and
   coastal dependent livelihoods, indigenous people, children and the
   elderly, poor labourers, poor urban dwellers in African cities, and
   people and ecosystems in the Arctic and Small Island Developing States
   (SIDS) (medium evidence, high agreement). {5.2.1, Box 5.3, Chapter 3,
   Box 3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4}
     __________________________________________________________________

   Climate Adaptation and Sustainable Development

   Prioritization of sustainable development and meeting the SDGs is
   consistent with efforts to adapt to climate change (high confidence).
   Many strategies for sustainable development enable transformational
   adaptation for a 1.5°C warmer world, provided attention is paid to
   reducing poverty in all its forms and to promoting equity and
   participation in decision-making (medium evidence, high agreement). As
   such, sustainable development has the potential to significantly reduce
   systemic vulnerability, enhance adaptive capacity, and promote
   livelihood security for poor and disadvantaged populations (high
   confidence). {5.3.1}

   Synergies between adaptation strategies and the SDGs are expected to
   hold true in a 1.5°C warmer world, across sectors  and contexts (medium
   evidence, medium agreement). Synergies between adaptation and
   sustainable development are significant for agriculture and health,
   advancing SDGs 1 (extreme poverty), 2 (hunger), 3 (healthy lives and
   well-being) and 6 (clean water) (robust evidence, medium agreement).
   {5.3.2} Ecosystem- and community- based adaptation, along with the
   incorporation of indigenous and local knowledge, advances synergies
   with SDGs 5 (gender equality), 10 (reducing inequalities) and 16
   (inclusive societies), as exemplified in drylands and the Arctic (high
   evidence, medium agreement). {5.3.2, Box 5.1, Cross-Chapter Box 10 in
   Chapter 4}

   Adaptation  strategies  can  result in   trade-offs   with   and among
   the SDGs (medium evidence, high agreement). Strategies that advance one
   SDG may create negative consequences for other SDGs, for instance SDGs
   3 (health) versus 7 (energy consumption) and agricultural adaptation
   and SDG 2 (food security) versus SDGs 3 (health), 5 (gender equality),
   6 (clean water), 10 (reducing inequalities), 14 (life below water) and
   15 (life on the land) (medium evidence, medium agreement). {5.3.2}

   Pursuing  place-specific  adaptation  pathways   towards   a   1.5°C
   warmer world has the potential for significant positive outcomes for
   well-being in countries at all levels of development (medium evidence,
   high agreement). Positive outcomes emerge when adaptation pathways (i)
   ensure a diversity of adaptation options based on people’s values and
   the trade-offs they consider acceptable, (ii) maximize synergies with
   sustainable development through inclusive, participatory and
   deliberative processes, and (iii) facilitate equitable transformation.
   Yet such pathways would be difficult to achieve without redistributive
   measures to overcome path dependencies, uneven power structures, and
   entrenched social inequalities (medium evidence, high agreement).
   {5.3.3}

Mitigation and Sustainable Development

   The deployment of mitigation options consistent with 1.5°C pathways
   leads to multiple synergies across a range of sustainable development
   dimensions. At  the  same  time,  the rapid pace and magnitude of
   change that would be required to limit warming to 1.5°C, if not
   carefully managed, would lead to trade-offs with some sustainable
   development dimensions (high confidence). The number of synergies
   between mitigation response options and sustainable development exceeds
   the number of trade- offs in energy demand and supply sectors;
   agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU); and for oceans (very
   high confidence). {Figure 5.2, Table 5.2 available at the end of the
   chapter} The 1.5°C pathways indicate robust synergies, particularly for
   the SDGs 3 (health), 7 (energy), 12 (responsible consumption and
   production) and 14 (oceans) (very high confidence). {5.4.2, Figure 5.3}
   For SDGs 1 (poverty), 2 (hunger), 6 (water) and 7 (energy), there is a
   risk of trade-offs or negative side effects from stringent mitigation
   actions compatible with 1.5°C of warming (medium evidence, high
   agreement). {5.4.2}

   Appropriately designed mitigation actions to reduce energy demand can
   advance multiple SDGs simultaneously. Pathways compatible with 1.5°C
   that feature low energy demand show the most pronounced synergies and
   the lowest number of trade-offs with respect to sustainable development
   and the SDGs (very high confidence). Accelerating energy efficiency in
   all sectors has synergies with SDGs 7 (energy), 9 (industry, innovation
   and infrastructure), 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 12
   (responsible consumption and production), 16 (peace, justice and strong
   institutions), and 17 (partnerships for the goals) (robust evidence,
   high agreement). {5.4.1, Figure 5.2, Table 5.2} Low-demand pathways,
   which would reduce or completely avoid the reliance on bioenergy with
   carbon capture and storage (BECCS) in 1.5°C pathways, would result in
   significantly reduced pressure on food security, lower food prices and
   fewer people at risk of hunger (medium evidence, high agreement).
   {5.4.2, Figure 5.3}

   The impacts of carbon dioxide removal options on SDGs depend on the
   type of options and the scale of deployment (high confidence). If
   poorly implemented, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) options such as
   bioenergy, BECCS and AFOLU would lead to trade- offs. Appropriate
   design and implementation requires considering local people’s needs,
   biodiversity and other sustainable development dimensions (very high
   confidence). {5.4.1.3, Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3}

   The design of the mitigation portfolios and policy instruments     to
   limit warming to 1.5°C will largely determine the overall synergies and
   trade-offs between mitigation and sustainable development (very high
   confidence). Redistributive policies that shield the poor and
   vulnerable can resolve trade-offs for a range of SDGs (medium evidence,
   high agreement). Individual mitigation options are associated with both
   positive and negative interactions with the SDGs (very high
   confidence). {5.4.1} However, appropriate choices across the mitigation
   portfolio can help to maximize positive side effects while minimizing
   negative side effects (high confidence). {5.4.2, 5.5.2} Investment
   needs for complementary policies resolving trade-offs with a range of
   SDGs are only a small fraction of the overall mitigation investments in
   1.5°C pathways (medium evidence, high agreement). {5.4.2, Figure 5.4}
   Integration of mitigation with adaptation and sustainable development
   compatible with 1.5°C warming requires a systems perspective (high
   confidence). {5.4.2, 5.5.2}

   Mitigation consistent with 1.5°C of warming  create  high  risks  for
   sustainable development in countries with high dependency  on fossil
   fuels for revenue and employment generation (high confidence). These
   risks are caused by the reduction of global demand affecting mining
   activity and export revenues and challenges to rapidly decrease high
   carbon intensity of the domestic economy (robust evidence, high
   agreement). {5.4.1.2, Box 5.2} Targeted policies that promote
   diversification of the economy and the energy sector could ease this
   transition (medium evidence, high agreement). {5.4.1.2, Box 5.2}
     __________________________________________________________________

Sustainable Development Pathways to 1.5°C

   Sustainable development broadly supports and often  enables  the
   fundamental societal and systems  transformations that  would be
   required for limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre- industrial levels
   (high confidence). Simulated pathways that feature the most sustainable
   worlds (e.g., Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSP) 1) are associated
   with relatively lower mitigation and adaptation challenges and limit
   warming to 1.5°C at comparatively lower mitigation costs. In contrast,
   development pathways with high fragmentation, inequality and poverty
   (e.g., SSP3) are associated with comparatively higher mitigation and
   adaptation challenges. In such pathways, it is not possible to limit
   warming to 1.5°C for the vast majority of the integrated assessment
   models (medium evidence, high agreement). {5.5.2} In all SSPs,
   mitigation costs substantially increase in 1.5°C pathways compared to
   2°C pathways. No pathway in the literature integrates or achieves all
   17 SDGs (high confidence). {5.5.2} Real-world experiences at the
   project level show that the actual integration between adaptation,
   mitigation and sustainable development is challenging as it requires
   reconciling trade-offs across sectors and spatial scales (very high
   confidence). {5.5.1}

   Without   societal   transformation   and    rapid    implementation
   of  ambitious  greenhouse  gas   reduction   measures,  pathways to
   limiting warming to 1.5°C and achieving sustainable development  will
   be  exceedingly  difficult,  if   not   impossible, to achieve (high
   confidence). The potential for pursuing such pathways differs between
   and within nations and regions, due to different development
   trajectories, opportunities and challenges (very high confidence).
   {5.5.3.2, Figure 5.1} Limiting warming to 1.5°C would require all
   countries and non-state actors to strengthen their contributions
   without delay. This could be achieved through sharing efforts based on
   bolder and more committed cooperation, with support for those with the
   least capacity to adapt, mitigate and transform (medium evidence, high
   agreement). {5.5.3.1, 5.5.3.2} Current efforts towards reconciling
   low-carbon trajectories and reducing inequalities, including those that
   avoid difficult trade-offs associated with transformation, are
   partially successful yet demonstrate notable obstacles (medium
   evidence, medium agreement). {5.5.3.3, Box 5.3, Cross-Chapter Box 13 in
   this chapter}

   Social justice and equity are core aspects of climate-resilient
   development pathways for transformational social change. Addressing
   challenges  and  widening  opportunities  between and  within
   countries  and  communities  would  be  necessary   to achieve
   sustainable  development  and  limit  warming  to  1.5°C, without
   making the poor and disadvantaged worse  off (high confidence).
   Identifying and navigating inclusive and socially acceptable pathways
   towards low-carbon, climate-resilient futures is a challenging yet
   important endeavour, fraught with moral, practical and political
   difficulties and inevitable trade-offs (very high confidence). {5.5.2,
   5.5.3.3, Box 5.3} It entails deliberation and  problem-solving
   processes to negotiate societal values, well-being, risks and
   resilience and to determine what is desirable and fair, and to whom
   (medium evidence, high agreement). Pathways that encompass joint,
   iterative planning and transformative visions, for instance in Pacific
   SIDS like Vanuatu and in urban contexts, show potential for liveable
   and sustainable futures (high confidence). {5.5.3.1, 5.5.3.3, Figure
   5.5, Box 5.3, Cross-Chapter Box 13 in this chapter}

   The fundamental societal and systemic changes to achieve sustainable
   development, eradicate poverty and reduce inequalities while limiting
   warming to 1.5°C would require  meeting a set of institutional, social,
   cultural, economic and technological conditions (high confidence). The
   coordination and monitoring of policy actions across sectors and
   spatial scales is essential to support sustainable development in 1.5°C
   warmer conditions (very high confidence). {5.6.2, Box 5.3} External
   funding and technology transfer better support these efforts when they
   consider recipients’ context-specific needs (medium evidence, high
   agreement). {5.6.1} Inclusive processes can facilitate transformations
   by ensuring participation, transparency, capacity building and
   iterative social learning (high confidence). {5.5.3.3, Cross-Chapter
   Box 13, 5.6.3} Attention to power asymmetries and unequal opportunities
   for development, among and within countries, is key to adopting
   1.5°C-compatible development pathways that benefit all populations
   (high confidence). {5.5.3, 5.6.4, Box 5.3} Re-examining individual and
   collective values could help spur urgent, ambitious and cooperative
   change (medium evidence, high agreement). {5.5.3, 5.6.5}

   For the IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing
   Climate (SROCC), more than 100 scientists from more than 30 countries
   are assessing the latest scientific knowledge about the physical
   science basis and impacts of climate change on ocean, coastal, polar
   and mountain ecosystems, and the human communities that depend on them.
   Their vulnerabilities as well as adaptation capacities are also
   evaluated. Options for achieving climate-resilient development pathways
   will be presented.

   SROCC is prepared under the joint scientific leadership of Working
   Group I and Working Group II, with operational support from the Working
   Group II Technical Support Unit.

   The IPCC will consider the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere
   in a Changing Climate (SROCC) on 20-23 September 2019 during its 51st
   Session to be held in the Principality of Monaco. The report is due to
   be launched on 25 September 2019.

Authors and Review Editors

   A call for nomination of authors was sent to governments, Observer
   Organizations and IPCC Bureau Members on 5 April 2017. They were asked
   to submit their nominations via their Focal Points by Wednesday, 17 May
   2017 (midnight CEST) using the online portal for submitting
   nominations.

   The IPCC selected the author teams that are now preparing the Special
   Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC). The
   selected experts took on roles of Coordinating Lead Authors and Lead
   Authors – who draft each individual chapter – and Review Editors, who
   ensure that comments by experts and governments are given appropriate
   consideration as the report develops. The teams are working together to
   produce the Special Report, set to be finalized in September 2019.

   The full list of SROCC Coordinating Lead Authors, Lead Authors and
   Review Editors is available on the author database.

   Statistics about author nominations can be accessed on the public
   portal.

History

   The Scientific Steering Committee for the scoping of a special report
   on climate change and the oceans and the cryosphere circulated a
   questionnaire to IPCC Focal Points and Observer Organizations on 7
   October 2016. A total number of 44 pre-scoping questionnaire responses
   were submitted. About 100 experts from 40 countries met on 6 – 9
   December 2016 in Monaco and prepared a draft outline. More information
   is available in the report of the scoping meeting.

   At its 43rd Session (Nairobi, Kenya, 11 – 13 April 2016), the IPCC
   Panel decided to prepare a special report on climate change and the
   oceans and the cryosphere.

   During its 45th Session (Guadalajara, Mexico, 28 – 31 March 2017), the
   IPCC Panel approved the outline of the Special Report on the Ocean and
   Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC).

   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will consider the
   Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate
   (SROCC) on 20-23 September 2019 during its 51st Session to be held in
   the Principality of Monaco. The report is due to be launched on 25
   September 2019.

Land is a Critical Resource, IPCC report says

   GENEVA, Aug 8 – Land is already under growing human pressure and
   climate change is adding to these pressures. At the same time, keeping
   global warming to well below 2ºC can be achieved only by reducing
   greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors including land and food, the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said in its latest
   report on Thursday.

   The IPCC, the world body for assessing the state of scientific
   knowledge related to climate change, its impacts and potential future
   risks, and possible response options, saw the Summary for Policymakers
   of the Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) approved by
   the  world’s governments on Wednesday in Geneva, Switzerland.

   It will be a key scientific input into forthcoming climate and
   environment negotiations, such as the Conference of the Parties of the
   UN Convention to Combat Desertification (COP14) in New Delhi, India in
   September and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference
   (COP25) in Santiago, Chile, in December.

   “Governments challenged the IPCC to take the first ever comprehensive
   look at the whole land-climate system. We did this through many
   contributions from experts and governments worldwide. This is the first
   time in IPCC report history that a majority of authors – 53% – are from
   developing countries,” said Hoesung Lee, Chair of the IPCC.

   This report shows that better land management can contribute to
   tackling climate change, but is not the only solution. Reducing
   greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors is essential if global
   warming is to be kept to well below 2ºC, if not 1.5^oC.

   In 2015, governments backed the Paris Agreement goal of strengthening
   the global response to climate change by holding the increase in the
   global average temperature to well below 2ºC above pre-industrial
   levels and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5ºC.

   Land must remain productive to maintain food security as the population
   increases and the negative impacts of climate change on vegetation
   increase. This means there are limits to the contribution of land to
   addressing climate change, for instance through the cultivation of
   energy crops and afforestation. It also takes time for trees and soils
   to store carbon effectively. Bioenergy needs to be carefully managed to
   avoid risks to food security, biodiversity and land degradation.
   Desirable outcomes will depend on locally appropriate policies and
   governance systems.


   Land is a critical resource

   Climate Change and Land finds that the world is best placed to tackle
   climate change when there is an overall focus on sustainability.

   “Land plays an important role in the climate system,” said Jim Skea,
   Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group III.

   “Agriculture, forestry and other types of land use account for 23% of
   human greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time natural land processes
   absorb carbon dioxide equivalent to almost a third of carbon dioxide
   emissions from fossil fuels and industry,” he said.

   The report shows how managing land resources sustainably can help
   address climate change, said Hans-Otto Pörtner, Co-Chair of IPCC
   Working Group II.

   “Land already in use could feed the world in a changing climate and
   provide biomass for renewable energy, but early, far-reaching action
   across several areas is required” he said.  “Also for the conservation
   and restoration of ecosystems and biodiversity.”


   Desertification and land degradation

   When land is degraded, it becomes less productive, restricting what can
   be grown and reducing the soil’s ability to absorb carbon. This
   exacerbates climate change, while climate change in turn exacerbates
   land degradation in many different ways.

   “The choices we make about sustainable land management can help reduce
   and in some cases reverse these adverse impacts,” said Kiyoto Tanabe,
   Co-Chair of the Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

   “In a future with more intensive rainfall the risk of soil erosion on
   croplands increases, and sustainable land management is a way to
   protect communities from the detrimental impacts of this soil erosion
   and landslides. However there are limits to what can be done, so in
   other cases degradation might be irreversible,” he said.

   Roughly 500 million people live in areas that experience
   desertification. Drylands and areas that experience desertification are
   also more vulnerable to climate change and extreme events including
   drought, heatwaves, and dust storms, with an increasing global
   population providing further pressure.

   The report sets out options to tackle land degradation, and prevent or
   adapt to further climate change. It also examines potential impacts
   from different levels of global warming.

   “New knowledge shows an increase in risks from dryland water scarcity,
   fire damage, permafrost degradation and food system instability, even
   for global warming of around 1.5°C,” said Valérie Masson-Delmotte,
   Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group I.

   “Very high risks related to permafrost degradation and food system
   instability are identified at 2°C of global warming,” she said.


   Food security

   Coordinated action to address climate change can simultaneously improve
   land, food security and nutrition, and help to end hunger.  The report
   highlights that climate change is affecting all four pillars of food
   security: availability (yield and production), access (prices and
   ability to obtain food), utilization (nutrition and cooking), and
   stability (disruptions to availability).

   “Food security will be increasingly affected by future climate change
   through yield declines – especially in the tropics – increased prices,
   reduced nutrient quality, and supply chain disruptions,” said
   Priyadarshi Shukla, Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group III.

   “We will see different effects in different countries, but there will
   be more drastic impacts on low-income countries in Africa, Asia, Latin
   America and the Caribbean,” he said.

   The report records that about one third of food produced is lost or
   wasted. Causes of food loss and waste differ substantially between
   developed and developing countries, as well as between regions.
   Reducing this loss and waste would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and
   improve food security.

   “Some dietary choices require more land and water, and cause more
   emissions of heat-trapping gases than others,” said Debra Roberts,
   Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group II.

   “Balanced diets  featuring plant-based foods, such as coarse grains,
   legumes, fruits and vegetables, and animal-sourced food produced
   sustainably in low greenhouse gas emission systems, present major
   opportunities for adaptation to and limiting climate change,” she said.

   The report finds that there are ways to manage risks and reduce
   vulnerabilities in land and the food system.

   Risk management can enhance communities’ resilience to extreme events,
   which has an impact on food systems..  This can be the result of
   dietary changes or ensuring a variety of crops to prevent further land
   degradation and increase resilience to extreme or varying weather.

   Reducing inequalities, improving incomes, and ensuring equitable access
   to food so that some regions (where land cannot provide adequate food)
   are not disadvantaged, are other ways to adapt to the negative effects
   of climate change.  There are also methods to manage and share risks,
   some of which are already available, such as early warning systems.

   An overall focus on sustainability coupled with early action offers the
   best chances to tackle climate change. This would entail low population
   growth and reduced inequalities, improved nutrition and lower food
   waste.

   This could enable a more resilient food system and make more land
   available for bioenergy, while still protecting forests and natural
   ecosystems. However, without early action in these areas, more land
   would be required for bioenergy, leading to challenging decisions about
   future land-use and food security.

   “Policies that support sustainable land management, ensure the supply
   of food for vulnerable populations, and keep carbon in the ground while
   reducing greenhouse gas emissions are important,” said Eduardo Calvo,
   Co-Chair of the Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.


   Land and climate change responses

   Policies that are outside the land and energy domains, such as on
   transport and environment , can also make a critical difference to
   tackling climate change. Acting early is more cost-effective as it
   avoids losses.

   “There are things we are already doing. We are using technologies and
   good practices, but they do need to be scaled up and used in other
   suitable places that they are not being used in now,” said Panmao Zhai,
   Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group I.

   “There is real potential here through more sustainable land use,
   reducing over-consumption and waste of food, eliminating the clearing
   and burning of forests, preventing over-harvesting of fuelwood, and
   reducing greenhouse gas emissions, thus helping to address land related
   climate change issues,” he said.

   Notes for editors


   Special Report on Climate Change and Land

   Climate Change and Land is the second in a series of Special Reports to
   be produced in the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Cycle. The report was
   prepared under the joint scientific leadership of all three IPCC
   Working Groups in cooperation with the Task Force on National
   Greenhouse Gas Inventories, with support from the Working Group III
   Technical Support Unit.

   The Summary for Policymakers presents the key findings of the Special
   Report, based on the assessment of the available scientific, technical
   and socio-economic literature relevant to climate change and land.

   The Summary for Policymakers of the Special Report on Climate Change
   and Land (SRCCL) is available at https://ipcc.ch/report/srccl. A Fact
   Sheet and Headline Statements are available at www.ipcc.ch.


   Key statistics of the Special Report on Climate Change and Land

   The report was prepared by 107 experts from 52 countries who acted as:
     * 15 Coordinating Lead Authors
     * 71 Lead Authors
     * 21 Review Editors

   This is the first IPCC report in which a majority of the authors (53%)
   are from developing countries.  Women account for 40% of the
   Coordinating Lead Authors.

   The author team drew on the contributions of 96 Contributing Authors;
   included over 7,000 cited references in the report; and considered a
   total of 28,275 expert and government review comments (First Order
   Draft 10,401; Second Order Draft 14,831; Final Government Draft:
   3,043).


   What is the IPCC?

   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the UN body for
   assessing the science related to climate change. It was established by
   the United Nations Environment Programme (UN Environment) and the World
   Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1988 to provide policymakers with
   regular scientific assessments concerning climate change, its
   implications and potential future risks, as well as to put forward
   adaptation and mitigation strategies. In the same year, the UN General
   Assembly endorsed the action by the WMO and UNEP in jointly
   establishing the IPCC. It has 195 member states.

   IPCC assessments provide governments, at all levels, with scientific
   information that they can use to develop climate policies. IPCC
   assessments are a key input into the international negotiations to
   tackle climate change. IPCC reports are drafted and reviewed in several
   stages, thus guaranteeing objectivity and transparency.

   The IPCC assesses the thousands of scientific papers published each
   year to tell policymakers what we know and don’t know about the risks
   related to climate change. The IPCC identifies where there is agreement
   in the scientific community, where there are differences of opinion,
   and where further research is needed. It does not conduct its own
   research.

   To produce its reports, the IPCC mobilizes hundreds of scientists.
   These scientists and officials are drawn from diverse backgrounds. Only
   a dozen permanent staff work in the IPCC’s Secretariat.

   The IPCC has three working groups: Working Group I, dealing with the
   physical science basis of climate change; Working Group II, dealing
   with impacts, adaptation and vulnerability; and Working Group III,
   dealing with the mitigation of climate change. It also has a Task Force
   on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories that develops methodologies for
   estimating emissions and removals.

   IPCC Assessment Reports consist of contributions from each of the three
   working groups and a Synthesis Report. Special Reports undertake an
   assessment of cross-disciplinary issues that span more than one working
   group and are shorter and more focused than the main assessments.


   Sixth Assessment Cycle

   At its 41^st Session in February 2015, the IPCC decided to produce a
   Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). At its 42^nd Session in October 2015 it
   elected a new Bureau that would oversee the work on this report and
   Special Reports to be produced in the assessment cycle. At its 43rd
   Session in April 2016, it decided to produce three Special Reports, a
   Methodology Report and AR6.

   The IPCC decided at its 43^rd session in Nairobi, Kenya (11-13 April
   2016) to prepare the report after member states and observer
   organizations were asked to submit views on potential themes for
   Special Reports during the current Sixth Assessment Report cycle. Nine
   clusters were considered on different themes, including land, cities,
   and oceans.  The Special Report on Climate Change and Land represents
   the second largest cluster and covers 7 proposals from member states
   and observer organizations that related to land.

   Last year the IPCC released the Special Report on Global Warming of
   1.5°C, which looked at global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial
   levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways in the
   context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate
   change. In September 2019 the IPCC will release the Special Report on
   the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate.

   It delivered a Methodology Report, the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC
   Guidelines for  National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, in May 2019. The
   2019 Refinement provides an updated scientific basis for supporting the
   preparation of national greenhouse gas inventories. Over 280 scientists
   and experts worked on the 2019 Refinement to produce many changes to
   the general guidance as well as methodologies for four sectors: energy;
   industrial processes and product use; agriculture, forestry and other
   land use; and waste.

   The AR6 Synthesis Report will be finalized in the first half of 2022,
   following the three working group contributions to AR6 in 2021.

   The IPCC will prepare a special report on climate change and cities in
   the next assessment cycle. All reports in the current cycle include a
   stronger integration of the assessment on the impacts of climate change
   on cities and their unique adaptation and mitigation opportunities.

The IPCC was created to provide policymakers with regular scientific
assessments on climate change, its implications and potential future risks,
as well as to put forward adaptation and mitigation options.

   Through its assessments, the IPCC determines the state of knowledge on
   climate change. It identifies where there is agreement in the
   scientific community on topics related to climate change, and where
   further research is needed. The reports are drafted and reviewed in
   several stages, thus guaranteeing objectivity and transparency.  The
   IPCC does not conduct its own research.

   IPCC reports are neutral, policy-relevant but not policy-prescriptive.
    The assessment reports are a key input into the international
   negotiations to tackle climate change. Created by the United Nations
   Environment Programme (UN Environment) and the World Meteorological
   Organization (WMO) in 1988, the IPCC  has 195 Member countries. In the
   same year, the UN General Assembly endorsed the action by WMO and UNEP
   in jointly establishing the IPCC.

   The IPCC prepares comprehensive Assessment Reports about the state of
   scientific, technical and socio-economic knowledge on climate change,
   its impacts and future risks, and options for reducing the rate at
   which climate change is taking place. It also produces Special Reports
   on topics agreed to by its member governments, as well as Methodology
   Reports that provide guidelines for the preparation of greenhouse gas
   inventories. Learn more about the reports here.

Activities

   The main activity of the IPCC is the preparation of reports assessing
   the state of knowledge of climate change. These include assessment
   reports, special reports and methodology reports. To deliver this work
   programme, the IPCC holds meetings of its government representatives,
   convening as plenary sessions of the Panel or IPCC Working Groups to
   approve, adopt and accept reports. Plenary Sessions of the IPCC also
   determine the IPCC work programme, and other business including its
   budget and outlines of reports. The IPCC Bureau meets regularly to
   provide guidance to the Panel on scientific and technical aspects of
   its work.

   The IPCC organizes scoping meetings of experts and meetings of lead
   authors to prepare reports. It organizes expert meetings and workshops
   on various topics to support its work programme, and publishes the
   proceedings of these meetings.  To communicate its findings and explain
   its work, the IPCC takes part in outreach activities organized by the
   IPCC or hosted by other organizations, and provides speakers to other
   conferences.

   More information on sessions of the IPCC, its Working Groups and the
   Bureau can be found in the Documentation section.

Working Groups and Task Force

   IPCC assessments and special reports are prepared by three Working
   Groups, each looking at a different aspect of the science related to
   climate change: Working Group I (The Physical Science Basis), Working
   Group II (Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability), and Working Group III
   (Mitigation of Climate Change). The IPCC also has a Task Force on
   National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, whose main objective is to develop
   and refine a methodology for the calculation and reporting of national
   greenhouse gas emissions and removals.

   The Working Groups and Task Force handle the preparation of reports,
   selecting and managing the experts that work on them as authors.

   The activities of each Working Group and the Task Force are supported
   by their Technical Support Units (TSU).
