     * Product Description

   0___________________
   World of Warcraft, released in 2004, is the world's most-subscribed
   MMORPG and a cultural phenomenon. The game lets players explore
   magnificent snowy peaks,
   visit vast mountain fortresses and travel through harsh, winding
   canyons. In this dangerous world you will find both mortal enemies and
   faithful friends. Fight monsters,
   raid gigantic dungeons and compete against other players in
   battlegrounds and arenas. Join millions of players in World of
   Warcraft.

   World of Warcraft Prepaid is the cheapest solution if you want to renew
   your existing account for 60 days.The price is significantly lower than
   in the case of payment via credit card and it's much safer.
   So why wait, waste money and give up on your raiding when you can buy a
   Prepaid?

   Keep in mind that you can't use World of Warcraft Prepaid to activate
   your account with TRIAL status! In this case you should buy a basic
   version of the game – World of Warcraft: Battlechest.

   Description:

   There is no better game on PC or console to capture the joy of holding
   the forces of creation in your hand. Whether you choose to explore the
   boundless world or to create a stronghold and rule over the region,
   Minecraft supplies you with abilities to do so.

   Minecraft game world

   The world of Minecraft is constructed entirely of blocks placed on a
   grid. It stretches across a potentially infinite, procedurally
   generated plane. As you travel discover new biomes, each rich with new
   materials for you to harvest. Explore caves and ruins full of monsters
   out to get you and resources for the taking.

   Minecraft open-ended gameplay

   Minecraft gameplay gives you perfect freedom. Explore the world, craft
   for yourself the tool for survival, or seek rare materials to complete
   an ambitious construction. Your rewards come from the satisfaction and
   a sense of power over the environment as you manage to build
   increasingly more complex structures. Set out goals for yourself and
   use a robust crafting system to accomplish them. Potentially endless
   world created by the game is yours to transform.

   Robust crafting system

   Minecraft boasts hundreds of crafting recipes for the players to
   discover and use. From tools to weapons and armor to aesthetic
   additions to your households, it is enough to keep playing for years.
   Add to this materials with special properties and you will be crafting
   complex mechanised arrangements and logic engines in no time.

   Minecraft game modes

   There are several game modes to choose from. The Survival mode throws
   you empty-handed into a hostile world, where you have to carve a place
   for yourself with your bare hands and increasing number of tools. Its
   extreme version is the Hardcore mode, with just 1 life and permanent
   death of your avatar and the world created for it. Creation mode
   unleashes your imagination, giving you unlimited resources, immortality
   and ability to fly allowing you to reshape the face of the world as you
   please. Spectator mode makes you a ghost, freely phasing through the
   blocks to explore what lies beyond.

   Minecraft online modes

   Adventure mode creates controlled environemnt placing customisable
   restrictions of the participants, to have them experience the world in
   a way the creator intended. Or set up a server an enjoy the full scope
   on Minecraft PC online multiplayer with your friends and likeminded
   players, together creating incredible projects.


   Minecraft Windows 10 Edition CD-KEY Features:

   Potentially endless world for the players to explore. Procedurally
   generated as you travel further, always keeps something to surprise you
   with.

   Several game modes, each catering to a different gameplay, from
   survival to exploration to boundless creation. Join up with friends and
   together create wonders.

   Interact with mobs, from wildlife to monsters, Minecraft makes sure you
   never feel alone in its vast world. Fight them, herd them or eat them,
   you are the king of the land.

   Other dimensions to explore, the Nether and the End Realm wait just on
   the other side of portals you can create.

   Day and night cycle changes the game between safe exploration and a
   fight for survival when the monsters come at night.

   Robust online community sharing advice and obscure crafting recipes.

   Grand Theft Auto V (PC), the fifth installment of the popular Rockstar
   Games series, once again takes you to the sun-soaked metropolis of Los
   Santos. Explore the open GTA 5 map based on Los Angelesand the
   landscapes of South California. Meet variety of people from faded
   celebrities to meth heads and encounter a true society diversity in
   every corner of the city.

   Release Date: 14 Apr, 2015

   Key Features
   Live the gangster life as one of the three criminals – Michael the bank
   robber, Trevor- the retired army pilot with a mental disorder or
   Franklin- a guy from the ghetto working for a local Armenian car
   dealer. The game story is constructed in such way, so that you can
   switch between characters.

   Tired of the never ending crime spree? Then, take your time to do some
   yoga or cycle through the countryside. Play tennis, golf or parachute
   over the city. Roam around Los Santos but beware of the drunkards and
   other weirdos causing unexpected events.

   Keep in mind that respect and money is everything. You won’t make a
   pile on stealing cars and petty crime. Instead, you should proceed with
   some big-deal robberies, recruit helpers and use explosives to make
   serious bucks.

   GTA 5 multiplayer gameplay offers the possibility to play with friends
   and other players. Create your own character, enter the map previously
   known from the single player mode and take part in various cooperative
   or competitive missions. GTA Online content will constantly develop to
   bring players best gaming experience.

   nobody, least of all each other.
