50 Cent Responds to Rick Ross' Value Comments: 'I Don't Know What His Value
Is to Music Culture at This Moment'

   Rick Ross has been on a press tour in the lead-up to his album, Port of
   Miami 2, and he recently revealed that he got Lil Wayne and Pusha-T on
   a record together despite their complicated history. Rozay has made it
   clear that he wants to help bury the hatchet in this beef, but thereʼs
   a feud of his own that heʼs not ready to call quits on just yet.

   During an interview with Big Boy, the rapper was asked if he would ever
   consider collaborating with 50 Cent, who he has had issues with dating
   back to last decade. "Honestly, Iʼm a businessman. If 50 Cent still had
   value, I may have been done it. But not being funny, homie just ainʼt
   that dude no more," he explained. "We was riding through L.A. smoking
   to ʼHate It or Love Itʼ yesterday. That shit was dope. We was saluting
   Cool & Dre, thatʼs Miami who did the production. Game, 50 Cent... That
   was dope. If he was still making music like that, of course."

   He continued, "Drake could hit me, and say, ʼRozay I got 50 on the
   record.ʼ And if he was still dope like he was eight years ago? Rozay
   will lace that."

   Complex Newsʼ Speedy Morman caught up with 50 Cent during a Power press
   run and asked the rapper what he thought of Rozayʼs comments. "I donʼt
   know what his value is to music culture at this moment," he said.

   When asked if he would ever collaborate with Ross, Fifty replied, "I
   never made music with him. I donʼt have interest in making music with
   him."

   He continued, "A lot of these guys, even when you make reference to
   music culture and stuff like that, theyʼre one-trick ponies, so theyʼre
   going to be gone. In hip-hop, they say itʼs not what have you done,
   what have you done for me lately, right? So you could get next to the
   guys that got momentum and try and survive based on that. But, itʼs not
   a lot going on there."

   Ross first dissed 50 Cent on his 2009 track "Mafia Music" following an
   issue that apparently took place at a BET event (as the story goes,
   Ross says 50 Cent looked at him the wrong way; Fifty doesnʼt even
   remember seeing Rozay there). In response, 50 released "Officer Ricky
   (Go Ahead Try Me)," and the feud escalated from there. The two have
   continued to take shots at one another in recent times. When Rozay was
   in hospital last year, 50 Cent mocked his condition. Additionally, this
   past October, a judge dismissed a lawsuit from 50 Cent against Ross
   over the use of the "In Da Club" beat.
