Presentation

VERIMAG

A Leading Research Center in Embedded Systems

   Embedded systems are at the heart of a wide area of applications,
   including avionics/aeronautics, space, transport, automotive,
   telecommunications, smart cards, consumer electronics. Embedded systems
   are composed of hardware and software components specifically designed
   for controlling a given application device. Embedded systems are of
   strategic importance for those sectors of the economy where Europe has
   traditionally been strong.

   Research at Verimag provides theoretical and technical means for
   developing embedded systems, contributing to scientific advancement and
   industrial progress.
     * Over the last fifteen years, Verimag has actively contributed to
       the development of the state-of-the-art, in particular for
       synchronous languages, verification, testing and modeling.

     * The tools produced at Verimag are regularly transferred to
       commercial CASE tools and are used in a number of industrial
       applications.

     * Verimag coordinated the European Networks of Excellence Artist
       (2001-06), Artist2 (2006-08) and ArtistDesign (2008-12).

     * All teams of Verimag take part in the Institut Carnot LSI.

     * Verimag is partner of the Labex PERSYVAL-Lab

   Verimag’s strategy is to maintain a good balance between fundamental,
   experimental and applied research. This is particularly visible in long
   term cooperation with academic and industrial partners.

   Verimag (UMR 5104), created in 1993, is an academic research laboratory
   affiliated with:
     * the University Grenoble Alpes (UGA),
     * the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS/INS2I) and
     * Grenoble Institute of Technology (Grenoble INP).

   Verimag plays a major role in the university and engineering curricula
   at both UGA and Grenoble-INP. Approximately 30 PhD students participate
   in Verimag’s research programs.

   Verimag regularly hosts major workshops and conferences.

   Verimag is composed of four teams:
     * Synchrone: Synchronous Languages and Reactive Systems
     * Tempo: Timed and Hybrid Systems
     * RSD: Rigorous System Design
     * PACSS: Proofs and Code Analysis for Safety and Security

   For more information, you can have a look at the last activity report.
