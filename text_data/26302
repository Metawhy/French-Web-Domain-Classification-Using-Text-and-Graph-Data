   2016 was a big year for Snapchat, with the platform continuing it's
   rapid evolution by introducing new ad features and options, along with
   the new user tools like Memories, Bitmoji integration and improved
   messaging functionality. And that, of course, is before we even talk
   about Spectacles, Snap Inc's first hardware play.

   But at the same time, new challenges arose - the most notable being
   Instagram Stories.

   And while the increased competition does present a new consideration
   for the app, the projections for Snapchat's continued growth remain
   strong.

   We created this infographic to outline Snapchat's expansion and
   position in the market in 2017, as well as the existing opportunities
   for marketers.

New Study Shows How Brands are Using Instagram Stories to Boost their
Messaging

   How time flies in social - this week, Instagram Stories turns one.

   That's right, Instagram's blatant Snapchat-clone, which has gone on to
   surpass Snapchat usage by a considerable margin, is celebrating its
   first birthday - and for Facebook, it is most definitely a celebration.

   Here's why (courtesy of Socialbakers):

     Instagram Stories vs Snapchat Stories usage timeline, 2016 - 2017 ↓
     #smm #socialmedia pic.twitter.com/Kkrh7D80r5
     - Socialbakers (@socialbakers) July 31, 2017

   For all the backlash and criticism of their approach, Facebook's
   strategy to curb Snapchat's influence looks to be working. Of course,
   Instagram comes from a much broader base through which to boost Stories
   usage - Instagram has 700 million total users versus Snapchat's 166
   million. But still, the lack of growth on Snap's part would suggest
   that Facebook's efforts have been effective, and are limiting Snap's
   capacity to become a more significant rival.

   Maybe when Snap Inc.'s Q2 2017 earnings are released next week they'll
   show a sudden uptick in user growth. But I doubt it. And if Snapchat
   posts another relatively flat user count, you can bet most of the
   credit/blame will go to Instagram Stories, and to a lesser degree,
   WhatsApp Status, another Facebook-owned Stories clone, which also now
   boasts 250 million users.

   But aside from overall usage stats, how are brands using Instagram
   Stories? We know that Stories are getting more attention, but are
   marketers also jumping on board and capitalizing on this new trend?

   This was the subject of a new study conducted by Klear, who analyzed
   149 popular brands in 8 industries to see how they've been using
   Instagram Stories, what's been the most popular types of Stories
   content and the specific industries seeing the most success with the
   option.

   Their data provides some interesting insights - here's what they found.

   First off, Klear says 45% of the brands in their study are now using
   Instagram Stories at least once per week, with some of the most
   well-known global brands among the most active Stories publishers.

   New Study Shows How Brands are Using Instagram Stories to Boost their
   Messaging | Social Media Today But more interesting from a general
   marketing perspective, Klear also looked at the types of Stories that
   these businesses are sharing, with merchandise promotions,
   behind-the-scenes type content and guest takeovers among the most
   popular.

   New Study Shows How Brands are Using Instagram Stories to Boost their
   Messaging | Social Media Today In terms of which industries,
   specifically, are most active on Instagram Stories, Klear found that
   the fitness and fashion sectors lead the way, and by a fair margin -
   which makes sense, given these industries are also amongst the most
   popular on Instagram in general.

   New Study Shows How Brands are Using Instagram Stories to Boost their
   Messaging | Social Media Today Klear has also provided a breakdown of
   the types of Stories being posted within each sector for additional
   perspective on what's proving popular in each.

   New Study Shows How Brands are Using Instagram Stories to Boost their
   Messaging | Social Media Today Of course, this is based on the content
   shared by these brands, not on the engagement generated or popularity
   of that content, which is an important distinction to make. It's fairly
   safe to assume that these brands are putting more focus on the content
   that's generating response, but it is worth noting that this chart
   doesn't show the most popular content types, but the most common in
   each sector. One does not necessarily equate to the other - though
   you'd expect there to be a fairly strong correlation.

   And the last element Klear looked at was where the top brands are
   linking their Instagram Stories to. Instagram has given some
   high-profile users the capacity to add links to their Stories since
   November last year - not everyone can do this yet (right now it's still
   limited to business profiles with at least 10,000 followers), but for
   those that can, it provides a significant opportunity to drive more
   traffic to their owned properties.

   According to Klear's data, the most common use of this functionality
   amongst the top brands is to link to a shoppable page - which, again,
   makes fairly logical sense (particularly given Instagram's aversion to
   off-platform link opportunities).

   These are some interesting insights into Stories usage, and provide
   some great perspective on how the top brands are using the option to
   advantage. Definitely, Stories provides a new opportunity, a new way to
   connect with your audience, and with more and more people signing up
   and becoming more active on Instagram, it makes sense for brands to
   maximize the opportunity if they can.

   These notes might help provide some inspiration as to whether you
   should be using Stories for your business, and how you might consider
   doing so to best effect.
