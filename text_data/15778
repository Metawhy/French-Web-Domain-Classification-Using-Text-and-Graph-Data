   We built this Website Speed Test to help you analyze your website load
   speed.

   The test is designed to help make your site faster by identifying what
   about a webpage is fast, slow, too big, and so on.

   We have tried to make it useful both for experts and novices alike.
   In short, we wanted it to be an easy-to-use tool built to help
   webmasters and web developers everywhere optimize their website
   performance.
