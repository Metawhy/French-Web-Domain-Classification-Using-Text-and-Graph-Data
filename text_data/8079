World Flags:

Flag of Colombia

The flag of Colombia was adopted on November 26, 1861.

   [gi.php?type=1&id=1597]

   It is a horizontal tricolor of yellow, blue and red. The yellow stripe
   takes up the top half of the flag and the blue and red take up a
   quarter of the space each.

   The horizontal stripes (from top to bottom) of yellow, blue and red
   tricolor have a ratio of 2:1:1. It—together with that of Ecuador, also
   derived from the flag of Gran Colombia—is different from most other
   tricolor flags, either vertical or horizontal, in having stripes which
   are not equal in size. (Venezuela, whose flag is also derived from the
   same source, opted for a more conventional tricolor with equal
   stripes).

   To begin the identification process, please post a comment to this page
   with the following information:

An image of the symbol in question

   This can be a URL/link or any other method that will allow the
   community to easily view the symbol. As a side note, please try to make
   the image as clear as possible. It doesn’t have to be large, but the
   symbol should be easily distinguishable.

As much contextual information about the symbol as you currently know

   Where did you find this symbol? Under what circumstances did you
   discover it? Do you know anything about its origins/provenance? Have
   you done any of your own investigating, and if so, what did you come
   across? The answers to such questions and any other information you can
   provide - no matter how insignificant - can go a long way towards
   helping the identification.

Please avoid including personal email addresses in your comments

   The best way to communicate during the identification process is
   through the comments chain on this page. It’s not a big deal if an
   email address does get included, but it would be much easier all around
   if you checked the comments chain regularly for any responses to your
   queries.
