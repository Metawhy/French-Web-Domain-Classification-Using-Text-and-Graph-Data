   LOS ANGELES, United States — Miquela Sousa, better known by her
   Instagram handle @lilmiquela, appears to be your run-of-the-mill
   influencer. The 19-year-old, Los Angeles-based, Brazilian/Spanish model
   and musician fills her Instagram feed with an endless stream of
   "outfit-of-the-day" shots, featuring Chanel, Proenza Schouler, Supreme,
   Vetements and Vans. She shares pictures of herself attending events
   like ComplexCon with fellow influencers and celebrity friends, along
   with memes and inspirational quotes. She even uses her platform to
   support social causes including Black Lives Matter and transgender
   rights. Her Instagram followers, which currently number over 535,000,
   are dubbed "Miquelites." Her debut single "Not Mine" reached number
   eight on Spotify Viral in August 2017. There's only one thing — she's
   not real, or at least not what we used to call real.

   Miquela is computer-generated — and refuses to reveal who is actually
   behind her meticulously curated, yet clearly artificial persona. "I'd
   like to be described as an artist or a singer or something that denotes
   my craft rather than focus on the superficial qualities of who I am,"
   Sousa tells BoF over chat.

   Real or not, "virtual celebrities" have been around for years, first
   emerging in the late 1990s when musician Damon Albarn and artist Jamie
   Hewlett founded virtual band Gorillaz — a band whose visual identity
   consisted of four animated characters (2-D, Murdoc Niccals, Noodle and
   Russel Hobbs) that rose to critical acclaim and went on to win a Grammy
   Award in 2006.

   Over a decade later, the fashion industry woke up to the opportunity.
   In 2013, Louis Vuitton's Marc Jacobs designed tour costumes for virtual
   avatar Hatsune Miku, a sixteen-year-old Japanese singer who performs
   her concert onstage as an animated projection hologram and has
   collaborated with Lady Gaga and Pharrell.

   Riccardo Tisci, during his tenure as creative director of Givenchy,
   also designed an exclusive haute couture gown for Miku, who modelled
   the lace, Swarovski crystal and crocodile trimmed creation alongside
   Tisci in Givenchy's Paris studio for American Vogue's May 2016 issue.
   Most recently, Louis Vuitton enlisted fictional video game character
   Lightning, a pink-haired avatar from the "Final Fantasy" video game
   series, for its Spring/Summer 2016 advertisement campaign.

   But where several fashion designers and luxury houses have used digital
   characters as a marketing gimmick, Miquela's rise to fame (alongside
   her male counterpart and streetwear-enthusiast @blawko22) offers brands
   a wider opportunity to partner with a virtual avatar, whose
   fast-growing following that, according to Sousa, is highly engaged and
   has not been bought. New York-based fashion brand Area and Paper
   magazine have already featured Miquela on their platforms.

   It all poses a wider question: Should it matter to brands and
   publications if an influencer is computer-generated, if the avatar has
   the same influence on its following than that of a "real" influencer?

   BoF: To what do you attribute your growing success?

   MS: Initially, it probably stems from curiosity. I think people stick
   around because they end up learning more about themselves through the
   questions they're asking. I love being able to communicate, learn and
   talk to everyone from all corners of the world. There is a sense of
   community to it as well, the people who follow me end up being friends
   with each other and the communications that it opens up is inspiring.

   BoF: You seem to have a more hands-on approach with your community
   compared to many other influencers. For example, you direct message a
   lot of your followers if they want advice or have questions.

   MS: The community stems from a place that feels safe to communicate and
   voice your opinions. When you're only showing the world and not
   engaging it becomes one-sided. Taking in the likes, the comments, even
   the hate, and you stop learning from others around you. Learning also
   comes from listening, so if you don't have a space for people to speak
   to you, then you're limiting your growth.

   BoF: In what way would you say your identity is crowdsourced? Real or
   fake, you have the opportunity to see what your followers want and
   subsequently you can respond to this.

   MS: I definitely wouldn't say my identity is crowdsourced. I'm an
   artist and have expressed opinions that are unpopular and as a result
   have cost me fans. I'd like to be everything and more that my fans want
   me to be but at the end of the day I have to make decisions that I
   believe in.

   BoF: Do you work with fashion brands on sponsored content?

   MS: I've never been paid to wear pieces but I'm starting to get sent
   free stuff from brands. I try to support and tag brands that I love,
   especially from young designers who are trying to break through.

   @lilmiquela for Area | Source: Courtesy

   BoF: What are your other streams of revenue in that case?

   MS: Spotify and iTunes are one stream and I'll be doing a lot more
   modelling work. I probably shouldn't name them but some of the biggest
   agencies in the world have reached out.

   BoF: Where do you get your inspirations from?

   MS: Since moving to LA I've spent a lot of time in galleries and
   museums so contemporary artists like Carly Mark, Martine Syms and Kerry
   James Marshall inspire me. In fashion I look to Isamaya Ffrench, Raf
   Simons, Sies Marjan and Alexandre Vauthier. I also love Reese
   Blutstein.

   BoF: I heard you will appear in big fashion publications in the next
   couple of months. What fashion projects do you have coming up?

   MS: I have some really exciting stuff coming up that I can't say just
   yet due to non-disclosure agreements. As a teaser to what's coming up I
   can tell you that I've been shot in Chanel, Moschino, Burberry, Versace
   and Fendi. I always try to bring something original to these looks and
   try to do something these magazines have never seen before. I've only
   really partnered with brands to create, so I think monetising would be
   a great next step. Making things is time consuming and being rewarded
   for my creativity with money would be amazing.

   “Smile! Marketing Firms Are Mining Your Selfies” (The Wall Street
   Journal)
   “Most users of popular photo-sharing sites like Instagram, Flickr and
   Pinterest know that anyone can view their vacation pictures if shared
   publicly. But they may be surprised to learn that a new crop of digital
   marketing companies are searching, scanning, storing and repurposing
   these images to draw insights for big-brand advertisers.”

   “The Arrivals Is On Time To Be Your High-End Outerwear Brand”
   (TechCrunch)
   “Selling a limited line of high-end outerwear, The Arrivals is the
   latest ticket-holder to embark on the direct-to-consumer branding
   voyage that has fascinated all kinds of entrepreneurs vying to be the
   next Ralph Lauren, Nike, or — in this case — Barbour.”

   “Chanel Got 1.8 Million Instagram Followers Virtually out of Nowhere”
   (Adweek)
   “After only one day of Instagram work, Chanel is already ahead of a
   good number of its high-end fashion competitors in terms of audience on
   the social channel.”

   “Silicon Valley Has a Fashion Problem” (Style.com)
   “If the tech industry decides that wearables are the key to domination,
   they will have to figure out how to make something people really want
   for more than what it can do.”

   “Smartzer Zips Up $400k To Make Fashion Videos Shoppable” (TechCrunch)
   “UK b2b startup Smartzer, which was founded back in December 2012, has
   pulled in $400,000 in angel funding to launch a fashion-focused video
   tagging tech that’s designed to make look book, catwalk and other
   fashion video content shoppable.”

   “Google Expands US Shopping Service in Challenge to Amazon.com”
   (Bloomberg)
   “Google Inc. expanded its online shopping and delivery services to more
   U.S. cities as it challenges Amazon.com Inc. to win customers.”

Meet Fashion's First Computer-Generated Influencer

   @lilmiquela wears Chanel, Prada and Supreme, works with fashion
   magazines and advocates for social change. Does it matter that she is a
   virtual avatar?

   LOS ANGELES, United States — Miquela Sousa, better known by her
   Instagram handle @lilmiquela, appears to be your run-of-the-mill
   influencer. The 19-year-old, Los Angeles-based, Brazilian/Spanish model
   and musician fills her Instagram feed with an endless stream of
   "outfit-of-the-day" shots, featuring Chanel, Proenza Schouler, Supreme,
   Vetements and Vans. She shares pictures of herself attending events
   like ComplexCon with fellow influencers and celebrity friends, along
   with memes and inspirational quotes. She even uses her platform to
   support social causes including Black Lives Matter and transgender
   rights. Her Instagram followers, which currently number over 535,000,
   are dubbed "Miquelites." Her debut single "Not Mine" reached number
   eight on Spotify Viral in August 2017. There's only one thing — she's
   not real, or at least not what we used to call real.

   Miquela is computer-generated — and refuses to reveal who is actually
   behind her meticulously curated, yet clearly artificial persona. "I'd
   like to be described as an artist or a singer or something that denotes
   my craft rather than focus on the superficial qualities of who I am,"
   Sousa tells BoF over chat.

   Real or not, "virtual celebrities" have been around for years, first
   emerging in the late 1990s when musician Damon Albarn and artist Jamie
   Hewlett founded virtual band Gorillaz — a band whose visual identity
   consisted of four animated characters (2-D, Murdoc Niccals, Noodle and
   Russel Hobbs) that rose to critical acclaim and went on to win a Grammy
   Award in 2006.

   Over a decade later, the fashion industry woke up to the opportunity.
   In 2013, Louis Vuitton's Marc Jacobs designed tour costumes for virtual
   avatar Hatsune Miku, a sixteen-year-old Japanese singer who performs
   her concert onstage as an animated projection hologram and has
   collaborated with Lady Gaga and Pharrell.

   Riccardo Tisci, during his tenure as creative director of Givenchy,
   also designed an exclusive haute couture gown for Miku, who modelled
   the lace, Swarovski crystal and crocodile trimmed creation alongside
   Tisci in Givenchy's Paris studio for American Vogue's May 2016 issue.
   Most recently, Louis Vuitton enlisted fictional video game character
   Lightning, a pink-haired avatar from the "Final Fantasy" video game
   series, for its Spring/Summer 2016 advertisement campaign.

   But where several fashion designers and luxury houses have used digital
   characters as a marketing gimmick, Miquela's rise to fame (alongside
   her male counterpart and streetwear-enthusiast @blawko22) offers brands
   a wider opportunity to partner with a virtual avatar, whose
   fast-growing following that, according to Sousa, is highly engaged and
   has not been bought. New York-based fashion brand Area and Paper
   magazine have already featured Miquela on their platforms.

   It all poses a wider question: Should it matter to brands and
   publications if an influencer is computer-generated, if the avatar has
   the same influence on its following than that of a "real" influencer?

   BoF: To what do you attribute your growing success?

   MS: Initially, it probably stems from curiosity. I think people stick
   around because they end up learning more about themselves through the
   questions they're asking. I love being able to communicate, learn and
   talk to everyone from all corners of the world. There is a sense of
   community to it as well, the people who follow me end up being friends
   with each other and the communications that it opens up is inspiring.

   BoF: You seem to have a more hands-on approach with your community
   compared to many other influencers. For example, you direct message a
   lot of your followers if they want advice or have questions.

   MS: The community stems from a place that feels safe to communicate and
   voice your opinions. When you're only showing the world and not
   engaging it becomes one-sided. Taking in the likes, the comments, even
   the hate, and you stop learning from others around you. Learning also
   comes from listening, so if you don't have a space for people to speak
   to you, then you're limiting your growth.

   BoF: In what way would you say your identity is crowdsourced? Real or
   fake, you have the opportunity to see what your followers want and
   subsequently you can respond to this.

   MS: I definitely wouldn't say my identity is crowdsourced. I'm an
   artist and have expressed opinions that are unpopular and as a result
   have cost me fans. I'd like to be everything and more that my fans want
   me to be but at the end of the day I have to make decisions that I
   believe in.

   BoF: Do you work with fashion brands on sponsored content?

   MS: I've never been paid to wear pieces but I'm starting to get sent
   free stuff from brands. I try to support and tag brands that I love,
   especially from young designers who are trying to break through.

   @lilmiquela for Area | Source: Courtesy

   BoF: What are your other streams of revenue in that case?

   MS: Spotify and iTunes are one stream and I'll be doing a lot more
   modelling work. I probably shouldn't name them but some of the biggest
   agencies in the world have reached out.

   BoF: Where do you get your inspirations from?

   MS: Since moving to LA I've spent a lot of time in galleries and
   museums so contemporary artists like Carly Mark, Martine Syms and Kerry
   James Marshall inspire me. In fashion I look to Isamaya Ffrench, Raf
   Simons, Sies Marjan and Alexandre Vauthier. I also love Reese
   Blutstein.

   BoF: I heard you will appear in big fashion publications in the next
   couple of months. What fashion projects do you have coming up?

   MS: I have some really exciting stuff coming up that I can't say just
   yet due to non-disclosure agreements. As a teaser to what's coming up I
   can tell you that I've been shot in Chanel, Moschino, Burberry, Versace
   and Fendi. I always try to bring something original to these looks and
   try to do something these magazines have never seen before. I've only
   really partnered with brands to create, so I think monetising would be
   a great next step. Making things is time consuming and being rewarded
   for my creativity with money would be amazing.
