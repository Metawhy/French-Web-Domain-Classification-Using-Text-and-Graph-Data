   It's crunch time!! Christmas is just days away. If you are looking for
   a hostess gift, party favor, teacher gift or just a little gift to tuck
   in with something else, I have a quick project for you!!

Christmas Home Tour 2015...

   Merry Christmas everyone! Thank you so much for stopping by. All the
   decorations are up and the hot chocolate is warming on the stove. I
   hope you can grab a cup too and stay for a while to enjoy the tour of
   our holiday home.
   I just love Christmas and this time of year. Decorating for the
   holidays for my family and friends is my absolute favorite thing to do.
   Every room in the house has a tree or some little touch of Christmas. I
   have been collecting decorations for over 30 years and each year I add
   something new to that collection. However, as many of you know, I am a
   big shopper of "after Christmas" sales and thrift store finds are the
   best! You can really change the look of your home by using what you
   have in different ways year after year. I'm hoping some of my tips and
   tricks in this year's post will inspire you in your holiday home!
   Welcome to our home for the holidays...

Book Page Flower Tutorial...

   Hi everyone! A couple weeks ago I shared a tutorial on how to make a
   wreath made from book pages (I used an old, falling apart dictionary).
    Click here for the instructions. I finally hung it up where I wanted
   it for the holidays on a chalkboard frame with a big Merry Christmas
   bow. ( I bought that ribbon at TJMaxx last year)

   I also wanted to make a whole tree made with book page ornaments and
   handmade things to go with the wreath. Here's my attempt at a book page
   flower and I love them!!

   busy posting wonderful ideas on your blogs, so I hope you can share
   some of your projects here with everyone! These next two months, many
   of us will be cooking, creating and decorating for fall, Thanksgiving,
   Hanukkah and Christmas and the New Year. It will be so great if we can
   inspire each other during these busy upcoming holidays!!!
   Sew Darn Crafty is a place where you can share anything that you've
   posted on your own blog. Your post is linked here, then readers are

Linking your blog to the party…

   Sew Darn Crafty is a "sharing"party. I subscribe to a linking service,
   which provides the ability to link thumbnail pictures of posts from
   your blog to my blog. The pictures below are links to other blogs and
   the projects the blog owner wants to share with us. Each week, I start
   a new party where bloggers can add their own posts below for ALL to
   see!! Not only are you sharing your ideas and project, but the links
   will bring lots of traffic to your blog. You can add any project you'd
   like, old or new to your blog…cooking, crafting, scrapbooking,
   quilting, sewing, gardening, remodeling projects, vacation ideas etc.
   It so much fun to see what everyone is up to each week. This party
   would be nothing without all of you, so a great big THANKS to all of
   you who contribute. Follow directions below.

Visiting blogs at the party…

   If you are new to visiting linky parties…just come on in and click on
   any picture box below and it will bring you to that post that someone
   has shared!! There are always so many wonderful ideas…don't miss out.
   So let's get started this week!!

How to Make a Book Page Wreath...

   Hi everyone! I've been busy getting ready for the holidays. Christmas
   starts early for me, because I have a very big party in early December
   and the house is decorated from top to bottom. I have 12-13 decorated
   trees up...one in every room in the house. I've already started in the
   bedrooms upstairs, because the kids are gone and no one will see it and
   think I'm crazy!! Downs stairs has to stay decorated for autumn,
   because we also host Thanksgiving for both sides of the family.
   There is one exception this year. Our big family tree is already up in
   the family room. Our daughter Kelsie moved to Florida 2 weeks ago. She
   was away for all the holidays last year for a Disney internship and I
   couldn't have another holiday without her here to celebrate. The
   weekend before they left, we had an ALL holiday celebration. All four
   kids had Halloween trick or treat bags and carved pumpkins, we had a
   big Thanksgiving dinner, we decorated the big family Christmas tree and
   opened stockings and presents. We also had Easter baskets! Each room in
   the house was decorated for each holiday including Valentine's Day! I
   think I have a few pictures that I can share later.
   Right now, I wanted to share a wreath I made for one of the rooms.

Book Page Wreath...

   I've always wanted to make a wreath from old book pages and was
   inspired by this post from the blog Knick of Time.
   Here's my version.
   book page wreath
   I just love the texture and the color!

   I even made a little bow from the pages.

   Come on in to see how easy. It does take some time, but it's worth it!!
