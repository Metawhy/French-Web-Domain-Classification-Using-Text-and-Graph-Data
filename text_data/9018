The Dangerous Power of Emotional Advertising

   By Carly Miller April 14th, 2016

   It takes less than three seconds to have a gut reaction. According
   to Dan Hill in Emotionomics: Leveraging Emotions for Business Success,
   “Emotions process sensory input in only one-fifth the time our
   conscious, cognitive brain takes to assimilate that same input.”
   Emotions, rather than cognitive thinking, have a more profound impact
   on our actions; create lasting, instinctual impressions; and actually
   predispose us to follow the same course of action in the future.

   For brands, this is an incredibly powerful piece of information, and
   many are capitalizing on it by creating emotional ads designed to go
   straight for the gut. Emotional ads aren’t merely images and slogans
   that try to educate and persuade viewers. They strategically manipulate
   consumers’ feelings and stimulate the emotional triggers that influence
   how we make decisions. An emotional ad may be designed to incite anger,
   sadness, or joy—all targeted toward the brand’s end goal. While this
   can be a wildly successful strategy, the best emotional ads reach a
   resolution instead of leaving viewers wallowing.

   Take the irresistible “Puppyhood” video from Purina and BuzzFeed, which
   barely feels like an ad at all. It’s the story of a single man adopting
   a puppy, but it takes the viewer through a complete narrative as the
   cute pet and owner get to know each other in the man’s apartment. The
   tale of companionship has over 10 million YouTube views and segues into
   Purina’s other content marketing project: a high-level puppy care
   website that guides consumers through every step of dog ownership.

   While “Puppyhood” was a hit, not all emotional ads are winners, and
   misjudging an audience’s reaction comes with its own set of risks. For
   brands using emotional storytelling, the wrong tone or context can make
   advertisements feel more like con artistry.

Feelings are gold

   Brands are latching onto emotional ads because when they work, we reach
   for our tissues and our wallets. Trend Hunter Marketing analyzed 55
   emotional marketing campaigns, with categories ranging from “nostalgic
   storytelling” to “waiting dogs,” and found the average popularity score
   to be 8.0—higher than flashier categories like “adventurous auto” and
   “scandalous undies.”

   Emotional ads aren’t just likable, they also drive higher conversion
   rates. A study by the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising found
   that ads with purely emotional content generated twice as much profit
   as ads based on rational content (31 percent vs. 16 percent). According
   to a 2016 Nielson report, “Emotions are central to advertising
   effectiveness,” and ads that generated the best emotional response
   generated a 23 percent lift in sales volume. Per Psychology Today, fMRI
   neuro-imagery shows that consumers use emotions rather than information
   to evaluate a brand.

   Since emotional ads create a deeper and more visceral impression on
   the memory centers of the brain, marketers are now measuring more
   cerebral responses to content using neurometrics tools like facial
   coding, implicit response testing, eye tracking, and magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI).

   BrainJuicer, a behavioral science-based research and strategy company,
   offers its clients proprietary tools that access what psychologist
   Daniel Kahneman calls “system 1,” or the emotive part of the brain that
   guides the majority of consumer decisions.

   Alex Hunt, the president of BrainJuicer’s Americas market, told me that
   while the traditional marketing research models assume that persuasion
   produces desired behavior, consumer decisions aren’t guided by linear
   thinking nearly as much as by feeling.

   But not all feelings are created equally. When an emotional ad fails,
   audience reactions can veer from their intended course. So how do
   brands get what they want without manipulating the audience? Let’s
   examine some emotional content—both good and bad—to find out.

Some hard feelings

   Novartis, a pharmaceutical company, made some waves recently with
   a heart disease ad featuring a man sitting in an armchair, blissfully
   unaware as water slowly floods his room. Even though Novartis never
   mentions its products, cardiologists, professors, and marketers
   still slammed the ad, calling it “shameful” and “terrifying.” The tone,
   they claimed, was a subtle threat that manipulated vulnerable
   patients—maybe the right angle for selling heart disease drugs, but the
   wrong tone for winning an audience’s trust.

   For Graeme Newell, marketing consultant, speaker, and founder of 602
   Communications, successful emotional ads must strike the right tone:
   “Fear is a viable emotion to use, but it’s got to appeal on an
   instinctual, subconscious level, which is where more advertising
   happens.”

   Context is essential for emotional ads, a lesson learned from the
   fallout of Nationwide’s “Make Safe Happen.” The ad, which aired during
   the 2015 Super Bowl, begins with a sweet touch—a child listing the
   milestones of boyhood—but then, wait, actually he’s dead, due to a
   totally preventable car accident. The punchline was more like a sucker
   punch, delivered during a celebratory occasion and sandwiched between
   feel-good ads about puppies.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/L7ONrCvlSNo

   Nationwide misjudged both the tone and context of its ad, eliciting
   some scathing reviews, an audible “ugh” that echoed around living rooms
   nationwide, and Twitter backlash:

     Nationwide says “Enjoy the Halftime Show!”
     pic.twitter.com/VGesJZBWlN

     — Dan O’Donnell (@DanODradio) February 2, 2015

     Thanks to that Nationwide commercial this will be the last bath my
     little dude ever takes. pic.twitter.com/ivFpXXFRcN

     — Gary Parrish (@GaryParrishCBS) February 2, 2015

     No one in the Nationwide advertising meeting put up their hand and
     went, “Let’s sleep on this?”

     — Dan Graziano (@DanGrazianoESPN) February 2, 2015

   “One key component to successful emotional advertising is to find and
   capitalize on the core value of the brand, not just reach blindly for
   an emotional reaction,” Newell said. Otherwise, companies risk mocking
   an audience’s emotional intelligence. In this example, Nationwide
   blindsided audiences with emotion just for effect, which came across as
   manufactured and heavy-handed.

   That’s not to say successful emotional ads have to be saccharine and
   cheerful. In fact, negative emotions can be a powerful tool to elevate
   a brand’s message, as long as they’re not delivered too bluntly. Newell
   cautions brands to strategically resolve negative emotions and leave
   audiences with a positive takeaway.

   For example, Thai Life Insurance’s aptly named “Unsung Hero” tackles
   the dark subject of poverty but ends the story on the protagonist’s
   random acts of kindness. The ad, which tucked away the Thai Life
   Insurance logo on the closing screen, received over 27 million YouTube
   views and a top rating on BrainJuicer’s FeelMore50 best-of awards.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/uaWA2GbcnJU?enablejsapi=1

   Ogilvy & Mather Bangkok, the agency that created “Unsung Hero,” was
   also responsible for an emotional ad in 2012 that, according
   to Vocativ, industry experts called “the best anti-smoking ad ever.”
   “Smoking Kid” shows the results of a series of pranks when young kids
   approach smokers and ask them to light up their cigarettes. The ad went
   viral in 30 countries and coincided with a 40 percent increase in
   hotlines that help smokers quit, effectively using a dark truth and the
   power of “sadvertising” to power the campaign’s call to action.

   According to documentary filmmaker Ken Burns, “All storytelling is
   manipulation,” and in many cases, manipulation is just one of the many
   tools brands can rely on to stand out. But to create great content—with
   the added goal of driving ROI—they have to tap into a universal truth.
   That’s the only way to make sure a gut reaction doesn’t turn into a
   stomach ache.
