   list of ESL, EFL, ESOL, English Teaching Websites

A list of ESL, EFL, ESOL, English Teaching Websites

   General ESL/EFL/ESOL websites for teaching English:

   EFL Magazine:
   An online magazine for EFL/ESL teachers with really great resources.
   Lots of great articles that help you in your classroom, make you a
   better teacher, and keep you informed of all the goings on in the
   EFL/ESL field. Highly recommended; bookmark it and check it often as
   they are always adding new content.

   Teaching resources from the British Council and the BBC:
   Since this website is run by the British Council and the BBC it’s not
   surprising to find a lot of great material here. There is a substantial
   section for teaching ideas and continuing education.

   Real English for Gamers:
   This site is all about teaching English through the medium of games.
   With a focus on online multiplayer games. It’s a really interesting
   concept that I think could really engage students.

   ESL flow:
   This is a website that I have gone back to again and again throughout
   my years of teaching. This site has a HUGE amount of great free
   material here for all age groups and levels.

   Breaking News English:
   This link is to a page with all of the Breaking News English lessons
   (lesson plans based on news stories) as well as links to the lessons
   from Sean Banville’s other 6 sites. If you can’t find something you can
   use here you aren’t looking hard enough.

   Boggles World:
   It’s a little difficult to navigate this site at times but it makes up
   for it with the sheer volume of content on the site. Some of the
   role-play activities and worksheets are especially engaging for
   students.

   The Internet TESL Journal:
   This site is my biggest (friendly) competition for conversation
   questions, if you can’t find the conversation questions you are looking
   for on my site check here. They also have ridiculous amount of other
   content. I mean, it will make your head spin going through the site.
   This is a link to their link page so you can find the most content in
   the shortest amount of time.

   TalkEnglish.com
   This site has a lot of lessons for students and is a great resource for
   students looking to get some self study in. It also has a lot of
   listening lessons as well as grammar and speaking lessons. All in all
   some great things to browse through and check out.

   Linguapress.com
   This site has a lot of great reading related resources, with articles
   and activities for students. Also there are sections for grammar as
   well as games and puzzles.

ESL/EFL/ESOL sites focused more on speaking:

   Print Discuss:
   Print Discuss is a relatively new site with some great easily printable
   conversation questions. So what makes it different from this site? Well
   there are warm up activities and additional pictures to go with the
   conversation questions. The topics are more like lesson plans than a
   resource to supplement your lesson. There are also blog posts to help
   you become a better teacher.

   My Speech Class:
   A wonderful resource for speech topics and speech examples, with lots
   of different speech types. A great resource for preparing for a speech.

ESL/EFL/ESOL sites focused more on writing and grammar:

   The Purdue Online Writing Lab:
   Whether you are teaching writing or grammar, this site has some great
   explanations as well as quite a few exercises. This is a link directly
   to the exercises but make sure to look around the site for more
   resources.

   University of Victoria English Language Center:
   Not the massive amount of material that some ESL sites have but the
   considerable amount of material they do have is concise and easily
   accessible. They have some good grammar explanations and exercises as
   well.

   Expert Advice from Teachers to Avoid Common ESL Writing Mistakes:
   A great article on common writing mistakes made by ESL / EFL students.
   The article has tips on how students can avoid mistakes and what
   teachers can do to help their students improve their writing. There is
   also a tool on the site that highlights adverbs in a piece of writing
   as well as a page on how to properly use adverbs.

ESL/EFL/ESOL sites focused more on listening:

   iSLCollective:
   The iSLCollective video quiz maker is a free web-based tool that allows
   teachers to create interactive video quizzes around YouTube and Vimeo
   videos. There are a ton of video quizzes made by other teachers on the
   site or you can make your own. Tons of great material / tools on there.

   elllo:
   Are you looking for audio of conversations for your classroom? Look no
   further; this site has hundreds and hundreds of audio clips that span
   many different topics with transcripts and supplementary material.

   Randall’s ESL Cyber Listening Lab:
   This is another site with lots of audio clips and a large amount of
   extra material to go with each audio clip. Between this site and elllo
   you should be covered for listening exercises for your classroom.

ESL/EFL/ESOL sites focused more on teaching children:

   MES English:
   This is a great website for those who teach children. There is a lot of
   great stuff for your class here, both ready-made and customizable.

   English Raven:
   Teaching materials mostly for children and beginner learners with loads
   of worksheets and flashcards.

   City Kids English:
   Some free conversation questions for children, plus some tips on
   teaching kids. Also there are some flashcards with questions on the
   back that are available for purchase.

   LearnEnglish Kids:
   The British Council always puts out quality material for learners of
   English and this site is no different. A great resource for kids
   learning English or ESL / EFL teachers who teach children.

ESL/EFL test prep websites:

   IELTS Podcast:
   Here you can find, of course, a podcast for preparing for the IELTS
   test. But there are also lots of other free resources and materials as
   well. Like this IELTS vocab page. There is a paid service, but there
   are also lots of free resources as well that you can use to help your
   students prepare for the IELTS exam.

Find more links to ESL/EFL/ESOL websites:

   Rong-Chang.com:
   If you are looking for even more links to ESL related pages, this is
   where you want to go. This site has so many links you are sure to find
   at least three or four sites that will be of great use to you, just
   look in the left sidebar. It also has some teaching materials for your
   classroom on the main page.

   The 101 Best Websites For ESL Students:
   Just what the title says, 101 sites for that are great for ESL students
   or teachers. You are sure to find a useful site you haven’t heard of
   while going through this list. Take a look and find something new!

   ESLconversation.ca:
   Links to other sites, as well as some useful tips for teachers. Plus
   some daily conversation prompts. A growing site to keep an eye on.

   IvyPanda:
   Links to English grammar and English teaching profiles on social media
   and other big platforms like Facebook, YouTube, Reddit, and Telegram.
   There are 150 links to profiles that focus on teaching English, so
   there is a lot to explore.
