   Ferocity of Thursday storms surprised many who 'let their guard down'

   Back to Gallery

   After Wednesday brought only moderate rainfall to most parts of the
   greater Houston area, many residents breathed a sigh of relief,
   thinking they had dodged the worst of Imelda.

   Thursday proved them wrong. Widespread, intense rainfall led to
   high-water rescues, flooding of homes and a hospital evacuation.

   But Thursday's flash floods were not entirely unexpected, National
   Weather Service officials said, with warnings lasting until 7 p.m.

   This kind of misconception is common during tropical storms -- it even
   happened during Hurricane Harvey in 2017, said Jeff
   Evans, meteorologist in charge of the service's Houston/Galveston
   office.

   "It wasn't too bad yesterday, so people almost have a tendency to let
   their guard down based on what they're seeing," Evans said Thursday.
   "Perceptions sometimes don't meet the reality of the messaging."

   Wednesday was actually expected to be calm for much of the Houston
   region, according to Space City Weather, though areas in Jefferson and
   Orange counties were were slammed by rainfall.

   On Thursday, however, the region was pummeled with three separate
   weather systems, which prompted the National Weather Service to issue a
   Flash Flood Emergency warning for the entire region, according to Space
   City Weather.

   The storms were expected to move south later Thursday afternoon.

   As of 4 p.m. Thursday, Imelda had brought more than 43 inches of rain
   to Texas, making it the fifth wettest tropical cyclone for the
   contiguous U.S., according to the Weather Channel.

   Harvey holds the record, with more than 51 inches of rain recorded at a
   gauge near Mont Belvieu.

   Imelda started as a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico and made
   landfall in Freeport on Tuesday afternoon. But by Tuesday night, it had
   been downgraded to a tropical depression.

   So what's the difference? Essentially, it's wind.

   A tropical storm comes with maximum winds between 39 and 73 mph.  A
   tropical depression, on the other hand, is a low pressure system,
   accompanied by thunderstorms, that has winds below 39 mph.

   Despite the downgrade, the storm created huge amounts of rainfall -- in
   part because it moved so slowly over the area, at about 5 mph,
   according to the National Weather Service.

   Evans said it would hard to say whether the storm was acting as
   expected. Weather modeling is not an exact science, he added, and the
   storms can be unpredictable.

   But Space City Weather said in a post on its website Thursday that
   today was more significant than originally thought.

   "Unfortunately, while we knew heavy rainfall was likely in parts of the
   city today, we did not anticipate an event as significant in scope as
   this for Thursday," they posted.

   The storm is expected to bring more rainfall to eastern Texas through
   Friday, Evans said.

'Worse than Harvey': Small Houston-area town floods in Imelda aftermath

   Hundreds of people have been rescued from their homes in Chambers
   County as floodwaters from the aftermath of Tropical Storm Imelda —
   which officials fear may be "worse than Harvey" — continued on Thursday
   to inundate the region, where authorities were also forced to evacuate
   a hospital.

   Ryan Holzaepfel, Chambers County's fire marshal, said that by 2 p.m.,
   authorities had rescued about 300 people since the start of Tuesday’s
   storm. The brunt of them, about 250, were rescued on Thursday, he said.

   A shelter at East Chambers High School is hosting around 109 people and
   a second shelter may be established if that number grows. The majority
   of rescues, Holzaepfel said, were from people unable to escape their
   homes because of the floodwater caused by the remnants of the tropical
   storm.

   Authorities have also brought six horses and 25 pets, dogs and cats, to
   safety.

   Authorities from the U.S. Coast Guard and city of Baytown, as well as
   volunteers with boats, are pitching in with rescues, he said.

   The deluge of rain started Tuesday night as the storm made landfall and
   has continued through Thursday, causing parts of Highway 124 to fill
   with at least 4 feet of water, Holzaepfel said. The storm has also
   produced at least 100 emergency calls, but there were no immediate
   reports of injuries, the fire marshal continued.

   About 800 homes in the Winnie and Stowell area may be experiencing high
   water, he said.

   According to the National Weather Service, about 7 inches of rain fell
   near Mont Belvieu from Wednesday to Thursday afternoon, while 10 inches
   was recorded near Anahuac .

   The high water left Denise Broussard, 62, and her husband unable to
   leave their new home of two months as three feet of water surrounded
   the property about 10 miles northeast of Winnie, nearby in Jefferson
   County.

   The couple also spotted a large alligator that surfaced near their
   porch.

   “There’s a big one. And maybe a couple more,” said Broussard. “I think
   he’s under the house now.”

   Her husband went outside to check the levels and spied the six-foot
   invader in their yard along Highway 365, across from Gator Country — a
   15-acre alligator preserve.

   “He called me, ‘Come see, come see,’” he husband told her. “All I could
   see was the humongous head. Oh, my Lord. How are we going to get out of
   here?”

   As the water rose overnight, about five to six patients from the
   Riceland Healthcare hospital also in Winnie, Chambers County Precinct 1
   Constable Dennis Dugat said.

   "The hospital flooded, so we have to get them out," Dugat said.

   Atascocita Fire brought their high-water rescue vehicles to move the

   the hospital had received several inches of rain.

   "This didn't happen to us during Harvey, and also this came out of
   nowhere," he said. "(This) is worse than Harvey," Danishmund said.
   "We're just going to hang in there."

   Tropical Storm Imelda was downgraded this week after it made landfall
   near Freeport and continued to batter parts of Houston and southeast
   Texas with heavy rainfall. The storm is near Beaumont, according to the
   National Weather Service.

A. INTRODUCTION

   This Privacy Notice applies to the U.S. website, mobile application or
   other digital service (each a “Digital Service”) linking to this
   Privacy Notice and owned or operated by Chron, a publication of Hearst
   Newspapers, LLC, (“we”, “us”, “our” or “Hearst”). This Privacy Notice
   describes the privacy practices of Hearst only and does not cover the
   practices of other companies, including those that may advertise or
   sponsor content, products or services on the Digital Services.

B. WHAT INFORMATION WE OBTAIN

   When you use a Digital Service, we may obtain various types of
   information related to you and your use of the Digital Service. This
   may include information that directly identifies you such as your name,
   address, or contact information (this type of information may be called
   “personal information” or “personally identifiable information”). The
   information we obtain generally consists of information (1) you give us
   about yourself, (2) you give us about others, (3) automatically
   collected about your interactions with the Digital Services and our
   content or ads on third-party websites, apps or other media, and (4) we
   get from other sources.

   1. Information you give us

   We may ask you to provide information about yourself when you use the
   Digital Services. For example, to subscribe to one of our newsletters
   or news alerts, you will need to give us an email address. You may not
   be able to use certain features if you choose not to submit the
   requested information. The information you give us may include details
   such as:
     * Contact information (e.g., name, mailing address, email address or
       phone number).
     * Demographic, interests and household information (e.g., age, gender
       or education).
     * Payment information for subscriptions or purchases made through the
       Digital Services (e.g., payment card number, expiration date and
       billing information).
     * Comments, photos, videos and other content or information you
       choose to publish on the Digital Services or otherwise share with
       us.
     * Information you provide when you choose to participate in surveys,
       polls, sweepstakes, contests or promotions (including information
       about your participation in activities that may generate loyalty or
       rewards points).
     * Location information, which may include precise location
       information when you permit the Digital Services to access device
       location. To prevent the collection of precise location
       information, please refer to instructions provided by your mobile
       service provider or device manufacturer.
     * Other information you may allow us to access through your device’s
       permissions settings, such as your contacts or address book.
     * Transactional and activity information (e.g., requests, searches or
       orders).

   2. Information you give us about others

   You may give us information about other people, such as the name and
   email of a friend or contact with whom you want to share an article or
   the name and address of a gift subscription recipient. Do not give us
   information about others unless you are authorized or have their
   consent to do so. We will use their information for the purposes
   described in this Privacy Notice.

   3. Information automatically collected

   The Digital Services automatically log certain information about visits
   to the Digital Services, such as the number and frequency of visitors,
   technical information about browsers and devices used to access the
   Digital Services, and information about crashes or other technical
   issues. In addition, we and third parties may automatically collect
   certain information through automated means about your activities over
   time across the Digital Services as well as across third-party sites,
   apps or other media. The tools that collect this information vary
   depending on the Digital Services and include technologies such as
   cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, pixels, local shared objects
   (including HTML5 cookies) and software development kits (“SDKs”). These
   technologies may be included in our web pages, mobile apps, emails, and
   other digital content. The tools may assign or collect unique cookie
   IDs or other identifiers associated with your browser or device. The
   tools may collect information while you are using our Digital Services
   or while they are running in the background of your device.

   The information automatically collected may include :
     * Information about your computer, device, browser and operating
       system (e.g., type, model, or version).
     * Internet protocol (IP) address, which may be used to derive your
       general geographic area (e.g., city and country).
     * Device identifiers (e.g., mobile advertising IDs).
     * Information about your interactions with the Digital Services,
       including browsing activities and clickstream data that reflect the
       content you have accessed, clicked on, or viewed.
     * Information about how you accessed the Digital Services, including
       details about websites or apps visited immediately before or after
       accessing a Digital Service.
     * Demographic, interests and household information.
     * Information about your interactions with email messages and other
       communications, such as whether you opened or forwarded the email
       or clicked on links contained in the email.

   For more information about the use of automated means in the context of
   interest-based advertising and how you can limit tracking, see here.

   4. Information we obtain from other sources

   We receive information about you from other sources and it may be
   combined with other information about you. For example, we may obtain
   data from:
     * Operators of third-party sites or apps, content distribution
       channels and platforms (e.g., Roku, Amazon Fire TV),
       voice-activated assistants (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Google Home) or
       other devices and technologies when you interact with our content,
       products, services or ads available on those channels and
       platforms. The information we receive may include information about
       the content you view or access as well as your demographic
       information and information about your interests.
     * Third-party data suppliers such as data aggregators, data
       resellers, public databases and business partners. They may provide
       us with demographic information, information about your purchases,
       and other information that helps us learn about you and other users
       of the Digital Services.
     * Social Media Platforms and similar services (“Social Media
       Platforms”). When you engage with our content or ads on Social
       Media Platforms, or interact with features on the Digital Services
       that contain content or features provided by Social Media Platforms
       (e.g., login or sign in features or tools that allow you to share
       our content with others on Social Media Platforms), we may obtain
       information from Social Media Platforms, including your username,
       user ID, demographic information and other information, subject to
       the settings and privacy practices of the relevant Social Media
       Platform. We may obtain this information directly from the Social
       Media Platform or through plug-ins, integrations or applications.
       Please keep in mind that the operators of the Social Media
       Platforms may also gather information about your use of the Digital
       Services and their features and tools.

C. HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE OBTAIN

   If you make a purchase or place an order through or in connection with
   a Digital Service, we use your payment card information (e.g., your
   card number and expiration date) for limited purposes such as to
   process your transaction (including recurring payments, if applicable),
   to provide you with the requested products or services and for the
   purposes described under the section “To protect our rights or the
   rights of others” below. With respect to information other than your
   payment card information, we use that information:

   1. To provide you with the Digital Services. This includes:
     * Processing your requests regarding the Digital Services and our
       subscriptions, products or services, or your participation in a
       survey, sweepstakes, contest, promotion, event or similar
       initiative.
     * Providing customer assistance or technical support.
     * Customizing content, providing recommendations and enhancing the
       quality and your overall experience with the Digital Services,
       including by retaining your user preferences or presenting content
       in the most effective manner for the browser or device you use to
       access the Digital Services.
     * Maintaining, operating, improving and developing the Digital
       Services and related content, products or services, including
       developing new products and features based on users’ interactions
       with the Digital Services.
     * Learning about users of the Digital Services and analyzing how you
       and others interact with and respond to the Digital Services,
       including by measuring and optimizing usage, reliability and
       performance, conducting market research, analyzing trends, and
       supporting our operations (e.g., for accounting, auditing,
       financial, legal or other purposes).

   2. To communicate with you. This includes:
     * Sending you informational messages about the Digital Services
       (e.g., to confirm your subscription or notify you of changes to a
       Digital Service).
     * Delivering marketing or promotional communications, including
       offers or promotions about our or third parties’ products, services
       or other initiatives.
     * Responding to your questions or addressing your requests.
     * Communicating with you about surveys, sweepstakes, contests,
       promotions or events.

   3. For advertising and marketing purposes, including interest-based
   advertising. This includes:
     * Developing, managing and conducting advertising and marketing
       campaigns, promotions and offers, including about our content,
       products and services or third parties’ products, services and
       other initiatives.
     * Interest-based advertising (also known as targeted or personalized
       advertising or ads) is advertising based on your interests as
       inferred from your activities over time on the Digital Services and
       online services operated by third parties, as well as information
       from other sources. Interest-based ads may consist of text ads,
       images, animations or videos and may be displayed to you based on
       various factors, including the context of the site or app in which
       they appear (e.g., sport or travel section), information you
       provided to the operator of the site or app (e.g., when you created
       an account), your activities on the site or app (e.g., pages
       viewed, searches performed or ads clicked), and information such as
       your demographic, interests and household information.

     * On the Digital Services and on third-party sites, apps or other
       media, we, our service providers and third parties may use
       automated means to (a) collect information for interest-based
       advertising purposes or (b) serve you interest-based ads. These
       automated means vary depending on the Digital Services and include
       technologies such as cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, pixels,
       local shared objects (including HTML5 cookies) and SDKs. These
       technologies may use unique identifiers associated with your
       browser or device to support interest-based advertising.
     * We may use online and offline information we obtain about you,
       including your personal information, for interest-based advertising
       purposes. We may aggregate the information we obtain to create
       audiences that are most likely to respond to ads based on
       demographic, interests or household information.
     * Interest-based ads may be displayed to you by third parties, such
       as ad networks or exchanges.
     * There are steps you can take to limit the collection of your
       information for interest-based advertising purposes. These steps
       vary for the web and mobile app environments and are browser and
       device specific. To learn more about interest-based advertising and
       opt-out choices, see http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ and here.
     * In serving interest-based ads, we adhere to the Self-Regulatory
       Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising developed by the
       Digital Advertising Alliance.

     Cross-device linking. If you access the Digital Services from
   multiple browsers or devices, we, our service providers and third
   parties may try to establish connections among and link the different
   browsers and devices you use to access the Digital Services and our
   content or ads published elsewhere. This helps us provide you with a
   seamless experience across the browsers and devices you use and serve
   you with more relevant content and ads (e.g., so that we don’t show you
   the same article twice). See here for steps you can take to limit
   browser and mobile app tracking for interest-based advertising
   purposes.

     Analyzing and measuring the performance, effectiveness and reach of
   our advertising (including interest-based ads) and marketing efforts on
   the Digital Services and elsewhere.

       choices with respect to such party’s use of your information.

   Interest-Based Ads Opt-Outs

   Some of the ads you see on the Digital Services are interest-based ads.
   This means that these ads are customized based on the information we
   and others obtain about you. We describe below steps you can take to
   limit tracking of your activities and the delivery of interest-based
   ads in browsers and mobile apps you use to access the Digital Services.
   Please keep in mind that if you opt out of interest-based ads, you will
   still see ads, but these ads will not be based on your inferred
   interests. In addition, if you take the steps described below, some
   automated means may still be used to collect information about your
   interactions with the Digital Services for the other purposes described
   in this Privacy Notice (e.g., to remember user preferences or enable
   specific functionality).

   The technologies used to deliver ads on websites and mobile apps
   differ. Please also remember that opt-outs are browser and
   device-specific.

   Website (Browser) Opt-Out

       be able to change the settings to have your browser refuse certain
       cookies or notify you before accepting cookies.
          + If you choose to disable the use of cookies in your web
            browser, some features of the Digital Services may become

   Legal Bases for Using Your Information

   We process personal information for different purposes (as described in
   the “How We Use Information We Obtain” section, above) on the following
   legal bases:
     * To perform our contractual obligations to you. We and our service
       providers process your information to perform our contractual
       obligations to you when we use your information to provide you with
       the Digital Services and related content, products or services and
       to communicate with you. For example, when you purchase a
       subscription from us, we process your payment and contact
       information as necessary to confirm the subscription and we process
       your contact information and other details to provide you with
       support services you request. We also send you informational
       communications on this basis, including to confirm a subscription
       or to notify you of a change to a Digital Service. Failure to
       provide requested information could prevent or delay the fulfilment
       of our contractual obligations.
     * To pursue our legitimate interests. We process your information to
       meet our legitimate interests when we use your information to
       provide you with the Digital Services and related content, products
       or services, to communicate with you and for our advertising and
       marketing purposes. For example, our legitimate interests include
       making improvements to, customizing and understanding how you
       interact with the Digital Services and related content, products or
       services, and sending you communications about products and
       services we think may be of interest to you. To accomplish our
       legitimate interests, we may share your information with our
       affiliates and subsidiaries, service providers and business
       partners (including for our advertising and marketing purposes) and
       in the context of a corporate transaction. We maintain safeguards
       to protect the information we process to pursue our legitimate
       interests.
     * To comply with our legal obligations. We process and share your
       information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations when
       we use your information to protect our rights or the rights of
       others and when we share your information with other parties where
       required by law or as necessary to protect our rights. For example,
       we are required to collect certain information from you when
       processing your subscription payment for tax or financial reporting
       reasons.
     * With your consent. We obtain your consent to process your
       information when we are required to do so by law. If consent is the
       legal basis on which we process your personal information, you can
       withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us using the
       information provided in the “Contact Us” section above.

   Your Rights Over Your Information

   restrict or to share your information in a usable format with another
   company. Such requests are subject to applicable law. We encourage you
   to contact us to update or correct your information if it changes or if
   the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate.

   If you would like to discuss or exercise such rights, please contact us
   at datarequestsnewspapers@hearst.com. We will contact you if we need
   additional information from you in order to honor your requests.

   Storing Your Information

   We will keep your personal information for as long as we have a
   relationship with you. Once our relationship with you has come to an
   end, we will retain your personal information for a period of time that
   enables us to:
     * Maintain business records for analysis, understanding market trends
       and/or audit purposes and to improve the Digital Services.
     * Comply with record retention requirements under applicable laws or
       other relevant legal or regulatory requirements.
     * Defend, establish, exercise or bring any existing or potential
       legal claims.
     * Carry out fraud detection and prevention.
     * Deal with any complaints regarding the Digital Services, our
       products and services.

   We will delete your personal information when it is no longer required
   for these purposes. If there is any information that we are unable, for
   technical reasons, to delete from our systems, we will put in place
   appropriate measures to prevent any further processing or use of the
   data.

International Data Transfers

   Information collected through the Digital Services will be processed in
   and subject to the laws of the United States, which may not provide the
   same level of protection for your personal information as your home
   country. If we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area
   and Switzerland we put in place safeguards. In particular, such
   safeguards include European Commission-approved standard contractual
   clauses. For more information on these safeguards, please contact us at
   the details provided in the “Contact Us” section above.

Changes to the Privacy Notice

   Where changes to this Privacy Notice have a fundamental impact on the
   nature of the processing or otherwise have a substantial impact on you,
   we will give you advanced notice so that you have the opportunity to
   exercise your rights (e.g. to object to the processing).

Privacy Officer and Complaints

   Our Privacy Officer can be contacted at privacy@hearst.com.

   event you have a complaint or concern about privacy. If, however, you
   believe that we have not been able to assist with your complaint or
   concern, you have the right to make a complaint to a data protection
   authority.
