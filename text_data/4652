   150 original objects

   The exhibition “Tutankhamun, Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh”
   celebrates the centenary of the discovery of the royal tomb by
   presenting a collection of exceptional masterpieces.

   Fifty years after “the exhibition of the century” – which had gathered
   more than 1.2 million visitors in 1967 in Paris – it is a unique
   opportunity to rediscover the history of the most famous of the
   Pharaohs before the permanent installation of the artifacts within the
   new Egyptian Grand Museum currently under construction.

   Presented by the Ministry of Egyptian Antiquities at the Grande Halle
   de la Villette, this immersive exhibition will unveil more than 150
   original objects from the tomb. More than 50 pieces from this
   collection will travel for the first and last time out of Egypt. Come
   discover many personal belongings of the young sovereign who
   accompanied him in the two worlds that are life and death.

   The exhibition has now concluded in Paris. It has gathered a total of
   1,423,170 visitors since its opening, setting a new record of becoming
   the most visited exhibition in France.

   The Final World Tour continues at Saatchi Gallery in London 2 November
   2019 to 3 May 2020.

Tickets for London are on sale now.
