Vocabulary – Carnage

   on January 22, 2017
   favs India - part II
              at Gayatri

   In his first speech as President of the United States, Donald Trump
   said:

     “This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.”

Carnage is Destruction

   The word “carnage” has a Latin root and it comes from the word “carne”,
   which means “meat” or “flesh”. We see the word “carne” in words like
   “carnivorous” which means “meat-eating” and carnivore” which means
   “meat-eater”. Are you a vegetarian?

   Carnage means “bloody destruction”.

American Carnage

   In Trump’s view, America has been destroyed by crime, gangs, poverty,
   lack of education and economic collapse. He uses the word “carnage” as
   a a metaphor for “destruction”, “decay”, “death” because he sees a
   nation in crisis.

   The United States of America is a complex multi-cultural nation and it
   is the largest economy in the world and the most powerful military
   force.

Questions

   How do people view the USA in your society? Is it a benevolent force or
   a malevolent force or is the answer more complex than that? Write your
   opinion in the comments section below.

Bourke Street Carnage

   As the United States of America listened to the first speech of the
   45th President, a criminal in Melbourne, Australia drove his car
   through a pedestrian shopping mall and killed and injured many people.

   Here is the headline from an Australian newspaper:

     Baby becomes fifth person to die from Bourke Street carnage

   Read about it here: Melbourne Carnage

   Is this type of crime common in your society? Tell us in the comments
   section below.

Vocabulary – Meat or Flesh?

   English has two words for meat (carne). The word “meat” is usually used
   at the butcher, in the kitchen or at the dining room table. The word
   “flesh” is sometimes used to describe meat on the table:

     When I eat chicken, I prefer the white flesh but some people prefer
     the bones.

   but generally “flesh” is a higher level word than “meat”. It is more
   commonly used as a metaphor or figure of speech for example in the
   proverb:

     The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak,

   which means “I want to do something but I do not have the courage to
   physically act.”

Carne is Meat

   We use the words “carne seca” to describe “dried meat” in the Brazilian
   dish: Feijoada. Listen to this conversation and learn to make feijoada:
   How to make feijoada

Reincarnation is Rebirth

   Many people believe in reincarnation, which is the idea that the soul
   lives on after the death of the body and it enters another body. You
   can read a story where this happens: The Lives of a Man

   Do you believe in reincarnation? Tell us what you think in the comments
   section below.

Superman

   In this song the singer says: “I am more than a bird.”

   He also talks about “kryptonite” and references the phrases from
   Superman:

     Look up in the sky!
     It is not a bird. It is not a plane.
     Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive. Able
     to leap tall buildings at a single bound.
     Superman!

Listening to Phrases in a Complex Talk

   on June 10, 2016 · 6 Comments

Listening

   Listening is a difficult skill. Here are some ideas to help with
   listening practice:

   Do not expect to understand everything at the first listening. Listen
   for words and phrases that you can understand. Do not worry about the
   parts you do not get. Focus on what you DO get.

Complex Text

   The above audio text is complex text. You will not understand
   everything at first. It does not matter. It is not important. Just
   listen.

     Which words did you hear?
     Which phrases did you identify?

Partial Transcript

   The audio is about a book by Herman Hesse

   Did you get these:

   Hello everyone.

   My name is Rachel

   a very complicated book

   it was published
   it was first translated into into English

   briefly summarise the plot

   a futuristic world

   play and nurture

   makes it clear

   not what Hesse actually intended the book to be about

   more than just a coming of age story

   hard to explain

   the fictional biographer’s perspective

   somewhere in my brain i understand

   to me ..

   especially because

   monasteries have served as preservers and keepers of knowledge

   This woman lost her daughter. She swallowed a button battery. Do not
   let children have access to button batteries.

   Listen to the audio and read the text. This is a sad story. It is a
   warning.

   comprehension skills takes time. Be patient. Listen again and again. If
   you have problems or questions write them in the comments section
   below.

     Are you underpaid?
     Does your employer threaten you?

Sugar Sugar

   on May 15, 2016 · Leave a Comment

   This song is about sugar and honey and love.

   Basically it is a metaphor for the sweetness of love. Candy, sugar and
   honey are all sweet things and love is sweet too.

Questions

     Is love always sweet?
     Is love sometimes bitter-sweet?
     Tell us what you think in the comments section below.

   At the beginning of our study of English we learn that some verbs do
   not appear in present continuous tense, for example, like, want and
   love.

Languages Change

   The MacDonalds’ advertisement slogan “I am loving in” has actually
   changed the way we use the word “love”. We used to use it in present
   simple but now it is used in present continuous as well.

   In the song “Sugar Sugar” we also hear:

     “You are my candy girl and you got me wanting you.”

   Note how the singer transfers his desire (wanting) to the object of his
   desire (candy girl) when he says:

     “You got me wanting you.”

Are we on the same Wavelength?

   on May 7, 2016 · 1 Comment

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Uw-_emw3AQ?feature=oembed

   “Are we on the same wavelength?” means “Do we see things the same way?”
   or “Do we understand each other?”

   It is a metaphor from the idea of a radio or tv channel. You adjust it
   to the correct wavelength to pick up the station.

How do you say “hello” in your language?

   on May 7, 2016 · Leave a Comment

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/rblYSKz_VnI?feature=oembed

   You say “yes”

   I say “no”

   You say “come”

   I say “go”

   Oh no!

   You say “goodbye”

   I say “hello”

   hello hello

   I say “high”

   you say “low”

   you say “why”

   I say “I don’t know”

Being Contrary

   If one person disagrees all the time we say: “That person is contrary”

   A contrary person is a person who likes to disagree. Have you ever met
   a person who is really contrary?

   Tell us about it in the comments section.

We Can Work It Out

   on May 7, 2016 · Leave a Comment

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qyclqo_AV2M?feature=oembed

Phrasal Verb

   “to go on” is a phrasal verb which means “to continue”.

   “To work something out” is a phrasal verb. When the Beatles sing “we
   can work it out”, they mean: “We can solve any problem.

Point of View – Perspective

   “Try to see it my way” means “Try to see it from my point of view”.

Life is very short

   There is no time for fussing and fighting.
   Do you agree?

Idiom

   “Only time will tell” means “we will know after some time”.

   Will the war in Syria end? Only time will tell. What do you think?

Time Goes by So Slowly

   on April 30, 2016 · 23 Comments

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/zrK5u5W8afc?feature=oembed

   These phrases are the same:

     Time goes by.
     Time passes.

   Does time pass slowly or quickly for you? Is there a reason for that?
   In this song the singer says “Time goes by so slowly” because he is
   missing his lover and waiting to see his lover again.

   Does time pass slowly or quickly for you? Why is that?

   Tell us about it in the comments section.

       I want that in the cuisine list will appear our country type of
       food. I am from Costa Rica, so, it will appear as Costa Rica´s
       cuisine. We are located in Central America, between Nicaragua and
       Panama. We are a tropical country, so, we have a lot fruits and
       vegetables. We have a lot of typical food and international food,
       also.

       I’m not sure exactly why but this blog is loading incredibly slow
       for
       me. Is anyone else having this issue or is it a issue on my end?
       I’ll check back later and see if the problem still exists.

       Hey! Do you know if they make any plugins to help with Search
       Engine
       Optimization? I’m trying to get my blog to rank for some targeted
       keywords but I’m not seeing
       ery good success. If you know of any please share.
       Many thanks!

       Have you ever thought about adding a little bit more than just
       your articles? I mean, what you say is valuable and all.
       However think of if you added some great images or videos to give
       your posts
       more, “pop”! Your content is excellent but with images and videos,
       this site could undeniably be one of the most beneficial in its
       niche.
       Great blog!

       For example, you’re in operation a pharmacy business, so your
       business changes can only impact the search results pages. Seems
       impossible, but then only 1 out of 10 hubs they publish is about
       history and politics, but then you get those that seem to come from
       hell. You may if you choose high page rank, to help you deal with
       website content.

       More recently and this may be the answer. This is typically
       automatically the case for sole
       traders or sole proprietorship matt cuttses.
       Not following the rules for paying employees and treating employees
       like independent contractors.

       This design is wicked! You definitely know how to keep a reader
       entertained.
       Between your wit and your videos, I was almost moved to start my
       own blog (well, almost.
       ..HaHa!) Excellent job. I really loved what you had to say, and
       more than that, how
       you presented it. Too cool!
