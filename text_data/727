   Project Gutenberg is a library of over 60,000 free eBooks. Choose among
   free epub and Kindle eBooks, download them or read them online. You
   will find the world's great literature here, with focus on older works
   for which U.S. copyright has expired. Thousands of volunteers digitized
   and diligently proofread the eBooks, for enjoyment and education.

   No fee or registration! Everything from Project Gutenberg is gratis,
   libre, and completely without cost to readers. If you find Project
   Gutenberg useful, please consider a small donation, to help Project
   Gutenberg digitize more books, maintain our online presence, and
   improve Project Gutenberg programs and offerings. Other ways to help
   include digitizing, proofreading and formatting, recording audio books,
   or reporting errors.

   No special apps needed! Project Gutenberg eBooks require no special
   apps to read, just the regular Web browsers or eBook readers that are
   included with computers and mobile devices. There have been reports of
   sites that charge fees for custom apps, or for the same eBooks that are
   freely available from Project Gutenberg. Some of the apps might have
   worthwhile features, but none are required to enjoy Project Gutenberg
   eBooks.

   Project Gutenberg is a library of over 60,000 free eBooks. Choose among
   free epub and Kindle eBooks, download them or read them online. You
   will find the world's great literature here, with focus on older works
   for which U.S. copyright has expired. Thousands of volunteers digitized
   and diligently proofread the eBooks, for enjoyment and education.

   No fee or registration! Everything from Project Gutenberg is gratis,
   libre, and completely without cost to readers. If you find Project
   Gutenberg useful, please consider a small donation, to help Project
   Gutenberg digitize more books, maintain our online presence, and
   improve Project Gutenberg programs and offerings. Other ways to help
   include digitizing, proofreading and formatting, recording audio books,
   or reporting errors.

   No special apps needed! Project Gutenberg eBooks require no special
   apps to read, just the regular Web browsers or eBook readers that are
   included with computers and mobile devices. There have been reports of
   sites that charge fees for custom apps, or for the same eBooks that are
   freely available from Project Gutenberg. Some of the apps might have
   worthwhile features, but none are required to enjoy Project Gutenberg
   eBooks.
