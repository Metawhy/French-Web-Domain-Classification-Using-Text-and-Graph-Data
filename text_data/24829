   Gallinette is a joint team of Inria and of the Laboratory of Digital
   Science of Nantes (LS2N), co-located at IMT Atlantique and at the
   Faculty of Science.

  Project

   The Gallinette team aims at enabling a new generation of proof
   assistants, with the belief that practical experiments must go hand in
   hand with foundational investigations:
     * We advance proof assistants both as certified programming languages
       and mechanised logical systems, via the integration of advanced
       programming and mathematical paradigms, notably dependent types and
       effects. We implement new programming and logical paradigms on top
       of Coq by considering the latter as a target language for
       compilation.
     * We extend the boundaries of the Curry-Howard correspondence beyond
       its currently-understood limits. A finer understanding of this
       correspondence will advance the foundations of programming
       languages and logic, and provide new methodologies essential to the
       development of proof assistants.

   Extending the current capabilities of proof assistants is a kind of
   experimental endeavour, probing every aspect of the correspondence,
   from programming languages and type theory to proof theory, rewriting,
   and algebra.
