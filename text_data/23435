ShortFormBlog

   The ShortFormBlog WordPress archives have returned to the internet. If
   you want to relive some experimental aggregation circa 2012, this is
   where you can go. (Also, this supports http as well as https, so you
   can look at it using an old computer.) This is still very rough, but
   it’s alive!

The Internet Relies on People Working for Free

   If you use open-source software, you may be benefiting from a person’s
   generosity of skill. But there may be a point where that generosity
   tiptoes over the edge. This great piece by Owen Williams talks about
   the tiptoe effect.

   It took a while to recover this, but this is roughly what ShortFormBlog
   version 1.0 looked like around launch, when it was a WordPress site.

   Billy Mitchell, the man whose Donkey Kong record matters more than
   anything else (and the antagonist of “The King of Kong”) is threatening
   legal action to get his high score back. His “evidence package” is on
   the Internet Archive, and it’s a doozy. You can tell he’s serious
   because he used that picture on the front.

     To be able to expand your experience, to become a more whole person
     by being able to try and fail, this is what teaches us who we are
     and who we want to become. This is what’s denied to the rising
     generation. They’re so ruthlessly and strictly identified in every
     network they interact with and by which they live. They’re denied
     the opportunities we had to be forgotten and to have their mistakes
     forgiven.

  So what's the deal?

   Welome to ShortFormBlog, mark two! You know how bands sometimes do
   reunion tours? This is like that. We’re a decade-old blog with a long
   history on Tumblr and elsewhere, back for another round of offbeat news
   and interesting links.

   Back in our day, we were mentioned by both Time and Newsweek when that
   meant something. We’re in the midst of dusting off some cobwebs, but
   definitely give us a follow and a shout!
