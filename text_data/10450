   Hello! This post is a little refresh of my very favorite recipe -
   Galettes! If you follow me on instagram you know that I am a galette
   evangelist. I think galettes are the very best and most fun dessert
   because they are so easy to make and adaptable, but my recipe was a
   little bit hidden in the archives so I am pulling it out into the
   spotlight with this easy to find post. You can use just about any fruit
   you like or a combination of fruits, and feel free to adjust the sugar
   to taste. Be free! Don’t worry about it too much! Have fun!

   If you bake a galette make sure to tag me and #summerofgalettes on
   instagram and feel free to message me with any questions. I love seeing
   what you bake!

   All Butter Pie Crust

   All pie crust is made from the same basic ingredients: flour, fat,
   water, and salt. I am partial to an all-butter crust because I think it
   tastes the best. The key to flaky pie crust is to keep the ingredients
   nice and cold— especially the butter and water—and to work quickly and
   intentionally. I like to mix pie crust with my hands rather than a food
   processor or pastry blender because I can control the exact size and
   shape of the butter pieces for the flakiest results. Add a few
   teaspoons of sugar if you prefer a sweetened crust.

   Ingredients

   2 2⁄3 cups (340g) all purpose flour

   1 teaspoon kosher salt

   1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (255g) very cold unsalted butter

   1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar

   8-10 tablespoons (120ml) ice water

   Whisk the flour and salt together in a large bowl, cut the butter into
   1⁄2-inch cubes, and add the apple cider vinegar to the ice water.

   Working quickly, add the butter to the flour and toss to coat. Then use
   your fingers or the palms of your hands to press each cube of butter
   into a flat sheet. Keep tossing the butter in the flour as you go to
   ensure that each butter piece is coated with flour. The idea is to
   create flat, thin shards of butter that range from about the size of a
   dime to about the size of a quarter. If at any time the butter seems
   warm or soft, briefly refrigerate the bowl.

   Sprinkle about 6 tablespoons of the icy cold vinegar-water mixture over
   the flour mixture. Use a gentle hand or wooden spoon to stir the water
   into the flour until just combined. If the dough seems dry, add more
   cold water a couple of teaspoons at a time. You have added enough water
   when you can pick up a handful of the dough and easily squeeze it
   together without it falling apart.

   Press the dough together, then split it in half. Form each half into a
   disk, and wrap each disk in plastic wrap. Chill the dough for at least
   2 hours before using, but preferably overnight. Keeps for up to three
   months in the freezer wrapped in a double layer of plastic wrap and a
   layer of foil. Thaw in the refrigerator before using.

   VARIATIONS: For a rye variation, substitute 11⁄3 cups (175g) rye flour
   for an equal amount of the all purpose flour. For a spelt variation,
   substitute 11⁄3 cups (175g) spelt flour for an equal amount of the all
   purpose flour. You also may need a bit more water to bind the dough for
   these variations.

   Any Fruit Galette

   Yield: One 8-inch galette

   You can use this formula with just about any seasonal fruit. For
   apples, pears, and stone fruit peel if desired then slice into
   1/4-1/3-inch slices. Apricots (my fave!) can be gently torn in half or
   cut into quarters. Slice strawberries in halves or quarters if they are
   large. Rhubarb can be sliced into thin batons or 1/2-inch chunks. Feel
   free to experiment with combining your favorite fruits. I love stone
   fruit and berries together in the summer. Also, the apricot jam can be
   replaced with any jam or marmalade you like that will compliment the
   fruit you are using.

   1 disc pie crust

   3/4 pound (340g) fresh fruit

   1/4 cup apricot jam

   1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar, to taste

   2 tablespoons flour

   1/2 teaspoon lemon zest

   seeds of one vanilla bean (optional)

   pinch salt

   1 egg, for egg wash

   turbinado sugar and flaky salt for sprinkling

   Arrange a rack in the oven in the lower third and preheat oven to
   425ºF. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

   Combine the sugar vanilla bean seeds, lemon zest, flour and salt in a
   bowl. Add the fruit to a large bowl and sprinkle the sugar mixture over
   the top, but don’t stir quite yet.

   On a lightly floured surface roll the dough into a rough circle between
   1/8-1/4-inch thick and transfer it to a parchment lined baking sheet.
   Gently stir the fruit mixture until well combined.

   Spread the jam onto the center of the dough, then pour the fruit into
   the center of the galette. Press gently to compact the fruit into an
   even layer. Fold the edges of the dough up and over the fruit and press
   the folds gently to seal. Refrigerate the formed galettes until the
   dough is very firm.

   Brush the galette with egg wash, sprinkle with turbinado sugar and
   flaky salt if desired and bake until deep golden brown and bubbling,
   45-55 minutes. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.
