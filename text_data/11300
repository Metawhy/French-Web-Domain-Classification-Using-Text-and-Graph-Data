Back to School

   Wow! It has been quite a while since I last blogged. It was a busy
   second half of the school year- I had a baby! üë∂ My goal is to post
   monthly this year. üòä
   Last year, many books sat in boxes because we had some difficulty
   getting the correct number of shelves in the library. I am SO excited
   to say the rest of the shelves have arrived and ALL of the books are
   out of boxes and ready to be read! üìö
   I have been busy working in the library this summer. There is lots of
   new signage that I'm really excited about. üôå Check it out:
   Tables now have colorful supply caddies and numbers on the tables
   rather than table tents.
   [IMG_0879.HEIC]
   All of the device and library expectations are updated and posted where
   students (and myself) can easily refer to them!
   [IMG_0872.HEIC]
   [IMG_0877.jpg]
   Sections are now identified with large lettering. This will help
   students find what they are looking for! There will be nonfiction
   signage- it just isn't up yet!
   [IMG_0873.HEIC]
   [IMG_0875.HEIC]
   Another project this summer was the table arrangement. The library
   acquired 3 more tables, so that meant I had a lot of shifting to do!
   This year the library will have 6 big table groups rather than 8 small
   table groups. I think students will enjoy this because they'll have
   more space to work and more friends to work with! I'm excited to see
   their reactions to the new set up. Excuse the mess üò¨

Mock Caldecott Unit

   Second grade students at South Prairie have recently named Not Quite
   Narwhal by Jessie Sima as the Mock Caldecott winner in the building.
   [IMG_7895.jpg]
   To start their work, second graders learned about the criteria for the
   true Caldecott Medal and looked at several winning books along with
   Caldecott Honor books. We started with a favorite of Mrs. Sedrel's, the
   2015 Caldecott Medal winner, Beekle by Dan Santat.
   [IMG_7894.jpg]
   Students worked in table groups to evaluate 28 books using the sheet
   below:
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2019-01-13%2Bat%2B4.15.10%2BPM.png]
   Based on scores, students narrowed choices to these top four titles:
   [finalists.png]
   To evaluate the finalists, students used the same scoring sheet- except
   they did this part individually. Students independently watched a video
   of each book being read while they completed the scoring sheet.
   [IMG_7709.HEIC] [IMG_7706.HEIC] [IMG_7705.HEIC]
   After students finished scoring the final four books, Not Quite
   Narwhal was crowned the winner for South Prairie's 2018-2019 Mock
   Caldecott Award!

Building an epic LEGO Wall for the Library

   Last spring, I posted a project on the Donors Choose website and was
   lucky enough to have the project fully funded! Now, this dream has
   become a reality; our library has a new awesome to create with LEGOs!
   [IMG_1298%2B2.jpg] [IMG_1275%2B3.jpg]
   Creating the walls themselves was actually pretty simple! Here are the
   steps:
   1. Gather your materials.
          - Hardboard (like this...Lowe's will even cut it for you üëè)
          - Baseplates (I used peel and stick baseplates from QT Creative)
          - LEGO blocks (you will need some pieces as you assemble the
   wall)
          - Velcro strips (I used 3M Picture Hanging Strips)
   [IMG_7301.jpg]
   2. Trim the baseplates to fit your surface.
   [IMG_7370.PNG] [IMG_7371.PNG] [IMG_7372.PNG]
   3. Sand the corners where you trimmed.
   [IMG_7374.PNG]
   4. Peel backing from baseplate and stick on your surface. The first
   plate is most important!! Make sure it's straight üòÜ
   [IMG_7375.PNG]
   5. Follow the directions on the baseplate package to apply the
   remaining baseplates.
   [IMG_7376.PNG]
   6. Attach LEGO wall to your surface (or use them as portable boards)! 3
   of my boards are attached to doors in the library with the 3M Picture
   Hanging Strips. They are super-easy to remove and display in the
   library window!
          - Make sure to let the Hanging Strips set for an hour before
   kiddos start using the
            boards!
   [IMG_7378.PNG]
   [IMG_7348%2B2.JPG]
   I've also created a video talking about the benefits of a LEGO wall,
   and it includes clips of the LEGO wall creation! Find the LEGO Wall
   video here or watch below!

Library Scavenger Hunts: A Back-to-School Adventure

   To get back into the swing of things at South Prairie, 3rd-5th graders
   worked on different library scavenger hunts! Each hunt had students
   search for important places in the library as well as the locations of
   popular books and series.
   3rd graders did a BINGO-style hunt. Instead of a BINGO, students wrote
   the number that appeared next to the item/location they found.
   [IMG_3492C5DEBE09-1.jpeg]
   4th graders got to do the QR code scavenger hunt this year. QR codes
   are a handy and easy tool to use in the library when students need to
   access information! With a partner, students worked to locate QR codes
   around the library. Each QR code provided students with essential
   beginning-of-the-year information. Students would then record the
   answer on their paper.
   [IMG_44DCC029376D-1.jpeg]
   5th graders did something totally new to them! I created a library
   scavenger hunt in the GooseChase app. GooseChase is a scavenger hunt
   app that asks users to complete missions using photos, videos, and
   text.
   Here are some of the missions in our GooseChase:
   [IMG_1278.PNG]
   This was my first time using GooseChase as a facilitator and not a
   participant! 5th graders loved taking selfies to complete missions,
   working in a group, and using a new app on the iPads!

New Agriculture and Farming Books at DC Elementary

   Earlier in the school year, the Dallas Center Elementary library was
   awarded a $200 grant from the Iowa Agriculture Literacy Foundation.
   This grant allowed for the purchase of several new farming and
   agriculture books to add to the collection and to use with units of
   study.
   [Image1.jpg]
   Recently, second graders completed a mini-unit that reinforced the main
   idea/detail note-taking work they had been doing in their classrooms
   throughout the year. Students could work individually, with a partner,
   or as a trio to read all or part of a new book, then complete the
   handout, identifying one main idea and two supporting details.

            [Screen%2BShot%2B2018-05-13%2Bat%2B4.52.53%2BPM.png]
                           Access the handout HERE

   [Image2.jpg]
   [Image3.jpg]
   Below are some of the things students learned in their work:
   [Image1.jpg]
   Once students had read and completed the handout, it was time to return
   to one of their favorite web tools, Flipgrid. This group of students
   has used Flipgrid several times and with very few reminders were able
   to record their learning.

Awesome Octopuses

   As an extension to our fiction/nonfiction work with kindergarten
   students, we turned to octopuses--an animal with which many students
   already had a fascination. We began with a quick review of the
   difference between fiction and nonfiction books, and then we were off
   with our octopus books.
   [Image9.jpg]
   Students quickly began sharing what they already knew about these sea
   creatures, and we referred to National Geographic Kids's website for
   additional information as well.

            [Screen%2BShot%2B2018-05-10%2Bat%2B5.45.13%2BPM.png]
                    CLICK HERE to access the full article

   With all of our octopus learning, we turned to creating our own
   octopuses. We used a template from Minieco.co.uk. The template
   reinforced scissor skills, and students were able to design their
   octopuses with camouflage elements as they chose. You can CLICK HERE
   for the template:
   [Image8.jpg]
   Check out some of the students' work:

We've Been Busy!

   It's been a long time since we've posted about our students' work and
   activities. What have we been doing? All sorts of things! Take a look!
   Fourth and fifth graders are working on several things at once:
   accessing our AEA databases, reading nonfiction for main idea and
   details, and citing their sources. Eventually, their notetaking will
   lead to the creation of a Google Slides presentation.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2018-04-19%2Bat%2B5.14.19%2BPM.png]
   Third graders have just wrapped up their look at mythology and myths
   from around the world using a Scholastic site.

            [Screen%2BShot%2B2018-04-19%2Bat%2B5.20.09%2BPM.png]
                            Access the site HERE

   Students read myths, identifying main characters, summarizing the plot,
   and determining the purpose of the myth.
   Online catalog work is the focus for our second graders in the fourth
   quarter. Students learn about the visual and basic searches, then
   practice using the catalog to find books on the shelves.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2018-04-19%2Bat%2B5.13.25%2BPM.png]
   First graders are busy using PebbleGO to browse for an animal of
   interest, then learn facts about their animal that they then combine
   with make-believe information. The facts, along with their added
   silliness pieces, come together in a storytelling activity on Flipgrid.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2018-04-19%2Bat%2B5.13.14%2BPM.png]
    Finally, kindergarteners take the last several cycles of the year to
   read and listen to a variety of themed books. For example, recently
   students read Diary of a Worm and Diary of a Spider, then created their
   own Diary... books featuring animals or objects of their choice.
   [Screen%2BShot%2B2018-04-19%2Bat%2B5.13.36%2BPM.png]
   Our year's not over yet--stay tuned for more work and activities!
