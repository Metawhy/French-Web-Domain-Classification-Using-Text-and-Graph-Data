How to Outsmart Any Temptation With These 5 Science-Based Tricks

   The Challenge: We’re tempted, daily, and we often given in to our
   desire and regret it later.
   The Science: Research shows there is not just one but five ways to
   strengthen willpower.
   The Solution: Learn these five tricks and master temptation for good!
   I can resist everything except temptation – Oscar Wilde

   Just say no. Crush mind with mind. Resist temptation. We think of
   self-control challenges as battles:

   • on the one side is your better self that chooses what is good for you
   in the long term and is in line with your values and standards

   • on the other side, your tempted self attracted to immediate rewards
   and instant gratification.

   The fight is on and it is merely a question of firepower. I mean,
   willpower.

   Or is it?

   Angela Duckworth at the University of Pennsylvania and her colleagues
   at Yale and Stanford see self-regulation as a sequential process. In
   other words, self-regulation begins way before you need to make use of
   your willpower resources, which are limited. If you find yourself
   face-to-face with your temptation, it means many things went wrong
   before that.

The 5 steps of the process model of self-control

   Think of yourself as a citadel. At your core are your resolutions and
   your goals: eating healthy, finishing a project, or learning a new
   skill. Around your core there is a multi-layered system of defenses.
   Outside, laying siege to your citadel, are the alluring temptations and
   the sneaky distractors: candies, chips, TV shows, social media,
   partying, you name it.

1) Choose your environment

   Your first line of defense, and the most effective, is situation
   selection. That simply means choosing situations where you know there
   is only a small chance of specific temptations arising. For example, if
   you are trying to eat healthy, hang out with friends who are healthy
   eaters. If you do not want to eat chips when watching TV, create a
   chips-free environment in your home: do not buy them at the store! If
   you want to focus on your studies, go to the library.

2) Change your environment

   Fallback position #1: situation modification. Somehow step one did not
   happen. The temptation (say, some candy) or the distractor (say,
   Facebook) are in close proximity. But you can still engineer the
   situation to make the temptation less accessible while making the
   desired behavior easier to perform. If you need to focus on your
   writing, turn off Wi-Fi and your smartphone. If you want to go running
   early in the morning, disable the snooze button on your alarm clock and
   place your running outfit next to the bed the night before. If you are
   at a restaurant, do not ask for the dessert menu.

   Researchers found that when a bowl of candies is placed on someone’s
   desk instead of two meters away, office workers will eat 1.8 more
   candies per day. Which amounts to 9 more candies per workweek, and 468
   more candies over one year!

3) Distract yourself

   Fallback position #2: selective attention. OK, the cheesecake is on the
   table. Someone else ordered it. Not all is lost — you can still choose
   what you focus on. You could get more engaged in the conversation, or
   purposefully start noticing details of what your dinner party
   companions are wearing. For schoolchildren, this strategy can take the
   form of choosing to track the teacher instead of goofy classmates; for
   adults, choosing to track the activity rather than the distractors.
   Find something to say yes to instead of focusing on saying no to the
   temptation.

4) Change your thinking

   Fallback position #3. Despite your best efforts, the temptation is
   getting your attention. Time to fall back to the next-to-last line of
   defense, using cognitive change. That simply means getting into Jedi
   mode and use some mind tricks on yourself. Think of the cheesecake as a
   blob of fat — yours. Gain psychological distance: look at the situation
   from a third-party perspective: how would an external observer see the
   situation? What would they think of your present challenge? You can
   also achieve psychological distance by looking at the situation in an
   abstract way: what is the purpose of eating? What is food, if not a
   bundle of chemicals? Or you can think of your goal of healthy eating
   and all the benefits you would get by sticking to it.

5) Change your reaction

   Fallback position #4: response modulation. This is it. This is the time
   to crush mind with mind. All else failed. Someone just put a gigantic
   piece of cheesecake on your plate. Or you got an email alert on your
   phone, and you are tempted to see what’s up. Or your husband started
   watching that movie you wanted to check out, right there in front of
   you. This is when willpower comes in handy. And you can still have some
   good tricks up your sleeve, if you’ve prepared yourself. You might have
   trained your self-control muscle using challenges specifically designed
   to strengthen it; or you could have learned simple breathing techniques
   to master your impulses.

The take-home message

   Self-control does not need to be a willpower struggle. If we are smart,
   we can make choices that will successfully enable our pursuit of
   long-term goals without having to directly confront temptations along
   the way. We can then have more willpower firepower for when there is no
   other option and it matters the most.
