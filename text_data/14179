11.6. Governing law

   These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the

   jurisdiction.

11.7. Notice

   Any notices or other communications permitted or required hereunder,
   including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be in
   writing and given by Wassa (i) via email (in each case to the address
   that you provide) or (ii) by posting to the Site. For notices made by
   e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such
   notice is transmitted.

11.8. General

   The failure of Wassa to enforce any right or provision of these Terms
   will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or
   provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective
   only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of
   Wassa. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by
   either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without
   prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for
   any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of
   these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced
   to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these
   Terms will remain in full force and effect.

Politique de cookies

Cookies?

   Cookies are pieces of data that sites and services you use or visit can
   set on your browser or device and they can typically be read on future
   visits to learn more about the User and to personalize an experience,
   including the ads that are displayed to the User. "Cookies" is also a
   term that may be used to refer to a range of technologies that help éan
   operator identify Users and devices, which in turn can help personalize
   an experience, prevent fraud, store preferences, and speed up delivery
   of content.

How does Wassa use cookies?

   Wassa may employ cookies and related technologies described below for a
   variety of purposes, including:
     * to learn more about how our products and Services are used and
       similar analytical purposes;
     * to understand how Users interaction;
     * to understand how to improve performance;
     * to provide you content in your language.

What types of cookies does Wassa use?

   As described below Wassa employs a number of technologies to provide
   and improve the Service. When you use the Service you consent to our
   use of these technologies, but you are welcome to exercise the choices
   described below.

   Browser cookies: Wassa uses browser cookies. Most major browser
   companies offer tools or settings for Users that do not want cookies
   set or read on their devices. Please visit your browser’s settings or
   privacy settings pages.

   Local Shared Objects: Wassa may use local shared objects (also known as
   Flash cookies) on its sites. Flash cookies operate differently than
   browser cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser
   will not remove flash cookies. To learn more about how to manage flash
   cookies, you can visit the Adobe website and make changes at the Global
   Privacy Settings Panel.
   Beacons, pixel tags, clear gifs: Wassa or its service providers or
   third parties advertising within the Service may use these technologies
   to learn the online behavior and interests of Users and to personalize
   ads that Users see. To learn more about behavioral advertising, please
   visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s website.

   Device IDs and digital fingerprinting: The Service may use one or more
   of a variety of unique identifiers to recognize users and their
   devices, including MAC address, IDFA, Android Ad ID, and digital
   fingerprint, which may be comprised of several types of data, including
   device name, the app list or applications installed on the device, and
   browser characteristics. NOTE: Wassa may also generate and assign a
   user ID when you access or use one of its Services.
   What are my privacy choices for advertising?

   Advertising helps to defray certain costs of providing Services,
   especially costs that are incurred by Wassa but not recovered from
   Users. Thus, you may not have a choice to prevent advertisements from
   being presented when using the Services; however, you do have choices
   to limit personalized advertisements that are tailored to your
   interests.

   Developers may use other third party advertising networks. If you do
   not wish to receive personalized advertising that is delivered by third
   parties, you may be able to exercise that choice through opt-out
   programs that are administered by third parties, including the Network
   Advertising Initiative (NAI), the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA),
   and/or the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EIDAA).
   Where applicable, you may exercise your opt-out choices at the NAI
   website, the DAA website, or the EIAA website. Wassa does not control
   these third-party provided opt-out processes and is not responsible for
   any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued
   availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.

   Wassa uses Google to provide advertising through the Services and on
   third party websites. We may use the following features based on Google
   Analytics for Display Advertising: Remarketing, Google Display Network
   Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, and
   Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. To opt-out of
   Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display
   Network ads, you can visit the Google Ads Settings page.

   More choices regarding browser cookies and beacons and other tracking
   technologies

   There are several browser plugins available to Users that want to be
   better informed about and have more control over the use of cookies and
   related technologies on their devices. Some popular ones are Ghostery
   and Abine.

   Information and choices regarding tracking and targeting on mobile
   devices

   As of the effective date of this policy, Apple and Google offered the
   owners of devices that use their operating systems, iOS and Android,
   options for limiting tracking and targeting in relation to ads. Wassa
   does not control your device level opt out processes and is not
   responsible for any choices you make through such mechanism or for the
   continued availability, accuracy, effectiveness, or location of that
   mechanism. Using a device level opt-out mechanism may opt you out of
   all third party personalized advertisements, not just those delivered
   by Wassa.

   What are my privacy choices for advertising?

   Advertising helps to defray certain costs of providing Services,

   parties, you may be able to exercise that choice through opt-out
   programs that are administered by third parties, including the Network
   Advertising Initiative (NAI), the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA),
   and/or the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EIDAA).
   Where applicable, you may exercise your opt-out choices at the NAI
   website, the DAA website, or the EIAA website. Wassa does not control
   these third-party provided opt-out processes and is not responsible for
   any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued
   availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.

   Wassa uses Google to provide advertising through the Services and on
   third party websites. We may use the following features based on Google
   Analytics for Display Advertising: Remarketing, Google Display Network
   Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, and
   Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. To opt-out of
   Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display

   better informed about and have more control over the use of cookies and
   related technologies on their devices. Some popular ones are Ghostery

   Information and choices regarding tracking and targeting on mobile
   devices

   As of the effective date of this policy, Apple and Google offered the
   owners of devices that use their operating systems, iOS and Android,
   options for limiting tracking and targeting in relation to ads. Wassa
   does not control your device level opt out processes and is not
   responsible for any choices you make through such mechanism or for the
   continued availability, accuracy, effectiveness, or location of that
   mechanism. Using a device level opt-out mechanism may opt you out of
   all third party personalized advertisements, not just those delivered
   by Wassa.

   What are my privacy choices for advertising?

   Advertising helps to defray certain costs of providing Services,

   not wish to receive personalized advertising that is delivered by third
   parties, you may be able to exercise that choice through opt-out
   programs that are administered by third parties, including the Network
   Advertising Initiative (NAI), the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA),
   and/or the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EIDAA).
   Where applicable, you may exercise your opt-out choices at the NAI
   website, the DAA website, or the EIAA website. Wassa does not control
   these third-party provided opt-out processes and is not responsible for
   any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued
   availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.

   Wassa uses Google to provide advertising through the Services and on
   third party websites. We may use the following features based on Google
   Analytics for Display Advertising: Remarketing, Google Display Network
   Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, and
   Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. To opt-out of
   Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display

   better informed about and have more control over the use of cookies and
   related technologies on their devices. Some popular ones are Ghostery
   and Abine.

   Information and choices regarding tracking and targeting on mobile
   devices

   As of the effective date of this policy, Apple and Google offered the
   owners of devices that use their operating systems, iOS and Android,
   options for limiting tracking and targeting in relation to ads. Wassa
   does not control your device level opt out processes and is not
   responsible for any choices you make through such mechanism or for the
   continued availability, accuracy, effectiveness, or location of that
   mechanism. Using a device level opt-out mechanism may opt you out of
   all third party personalized advertisements, not just those delivered

   provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective

   Wassa. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by
   either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without

   What are my privacy choices for advertising?

   Advertising helps to defray certain costs of providing Services,

   parties, you may be able to exercise that choice through opt-out

   Advertising Initiative (NAI), the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA),
   and/or the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EIDAA).
   Where applicable, you may exercise your opt-out choices at the NAI
   website, the DAA website, or the EIAA website. Wassa does not control
   these third-party provided opt-out processes and is not responsible for
   any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued
   availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.
