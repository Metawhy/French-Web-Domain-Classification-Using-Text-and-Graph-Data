General Statement

   By accessing this site, certain information about the User, such as
   Internet protocol (IP) addresses, navigation through the Site, the
   software used and the time spent, along with other similar information,
   will be stored on WTO or its Designated Third Party (e.g. OECD and/or
   Ingenta) servers. These will not specifically identify the User.

   The information will be used internally only for web site traffic
   analysis. If the User provides unique identifying information, such as
   name, address and other information on forms stored on this site, such
   information will be used only for statistical purposes and will not be
   published for general access. The WTO, however, assumes no
   responsibility for the security of this information.

Specific to the WTO iLibrary

   The specific practices outlined in this privacy statement apply to the
   WTO iLibrary at https://www.wto-ilibrary.org.

Data Collection and Use

   In general, you can browse WTO iLibrary web site without disclosing any
   information about yourself. If you visit the WTO iLibrary web site to
   read or download information, we collect and store only the following
   information that is automatically recognised: the date and time, the
   originating IP address, the domain name, the type of browser and
   operating system used (if provided by the browser), the URL of the
   referring page (if provided by the browser), the object requested and
   the completion status of the request.

Cookies and Web Technology

   The WTO iLibrary makes use of "session" cookies. These are small bits
   of data that we send to your computer in order to improve your user
   experience. For example, the cookie keeps track of the fact that you
   have signed in so that when you move from one page to another, you do
   not have to re-enter your user name and password. Session cookies are
   removed as soon as you log out or close your browser.

   In order to change these cookie preferences, you must change your
   browser's preferences to disable or delete cookies. Please note that
   disabling cookies for some services may affect your ability to use that
   service. Security information is specific to each browser and operating
   system. Please check with your browser's specific company for more
   information, or visit the “Help” link directly in your browser.

   An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your
   computer when you connect to a network. Web servers—the computers that
   present web pages—automatically identify your computer by its IP
   address. We identify IP addresses for the purposes of system
   administration, to report aggregate information to our institutional
   customers, and to audit the use of our site. As is typical, when
   visitors request pages from the WTO iLibrary, our servers log the
   visitors' IP addresses, referrer site and user-agent information. We do
   not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable,
   which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains
   anonymous to us. We use such information to identify a user when we
   feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our house rules or
   terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers or others.

   If you have questions or comments about our customer privacy policy or
   you would like to confirm the accuracy of the information collected
   from you, please contact/mail your concerns to WTO Publications:
