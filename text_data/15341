   Dear Roadrunner Families,
   It is with mixed emotions that I am writing you all to share an
   upcoming change in my life. You may have already heard from your
   children, but it is important to me that I reach out to you as well to
   share that I will not be returning next school year. As you can
   imagine, it has been a very emotional process for me in making this
   decision, but in the end, I feel that this is the right choice in order
   for me to grow in my professional career. It has always been my dream
   to open a private therapy practice to help children and their families
   during difficult times. Last year I opened doors to Ensemble Therapy,
   and it has been quickly growing ever since. In the fall I also began
   teaching in the Social Work department at the University of Texas at
   Austin, spreading my knowledge of how to work therapeutically with
   children. In order to dedicate the time and attention these new
   endeavors require, I have made the difficult decision to make this my
   final year at Lee.
   I want to thank each and every one of you for all of your support, and
   for entrusting me with your children for the past four years. I am
   honored and feel so fortunate to have been given the opportunity to be
   part of the Lee Community. I have so many wonderful memories of my time
   at Lee and I am very sad to say goodbye. During my four years here, I
   have fostered relationships with many of you and I will cherish the
   memories and friendships I’ve made during my time. Lee Elementary has
   been a very special place for me and I will miss everyone.
   Know that my dedication to my position as your school counselor will
   continue as we transition to a new counselor throughout the summer.
   Although it’s hard to say goodbye to you, the hardest part of leaving
   is saying goodbye to the children. I have grown so attached to them
   over the years. I have loved watching them grow up into amazing young
   individuals. Please give them a hug for me and let them know how they
   have touched my heart and life. I treasure my memories of them all.
   Please stay in touch and I look forward to hearing about your child’s
   future successes.
   Please accept my sincere thanks and appreciation as I enter into a new
   learning experience of my own.
   Love,
   Ms. Sepp(y)
   P.S.  I encourage you to keep in touch at jaclyn@ensembletherapy.com

What does a School Counselor do

   I really enjoyed this chart because it clearly explains the roles of a
   school counselor at your school.  A huge thank you to The School
   Counselor Kind for putting this together!

Welcome Back Roadrunners!

   [IMG_0257%2B-%2BVersion%2B2.JPG]
   I hope you all have had an exciting summer!  I am thrilled to continue
   working with your kiddos here at Lee Elementary as their school
   counselor.  It has been so nice to see so many familiar faces and meet
   many new ones at Friday's "Meet & Greet."
   I will be doing lessons the first few weeks of school on getting to
   know the counselor, breaking the ice activities, the word
   “confidentiality” and also share with students the ways that they can
   notify me that they would like to visit.  It’s important to discuss
   with students things they may want to come talk to me about.
   I work with every student individually, in small groups and in their
   classroom throughout the year.  As part of my effort to maintain
   consistent and clear lines of communication with parents, I will inform
   you if your child is repeatedly requesting to see me.  The goal is to
   meet with your child regularly at first and then slowly decrease
   services to an “as needed” basis or give you referral options.  My goal
   is to help your child be successful both academically and socially
   through scheduled counseling opportunities so please feel free to
   contact me with any background information you’d like to provide.
   If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact
   me at jsepp@austinisd.org or (512) 414-1782. I also have a website,
   http://mssepp.blogspot.com with very helpful information about
   classroom lessons, learning about myself, counseling services,
   counseling calendar, frequently asked questions, helpful tips & useful
   links, online safety, No Place for Hate, SEL program, college & career
   info, state testing and Austin ISD’s mission statement.  Also, you  can
   follow me on twitter @RRCounselor.  I am happy to work with you to make
   your child’s time at Lee successful!

Mindfulness

   In kindergarten our last lesson of the year was on mindfulness.  I
   started by asking students if they know what mindfulness means.  Many
   students hit it spot on!  Mindfulness is all about being aware of your
   self and your emotions, being present.  When students are feeling big
   emotions, it's important for them to recognize what is happening in
   their body in order to take control.  I found this great, kid-friendly
   video that helps students recognize what happens to their body and uses
   a smart analogy of a bottle of sparkles being shaken up inside their
   brains.

   After the video we discussed how their bodies feel when they are having
   a big emotion and what tips the video told us on how to regain
   control.  Then we practiced these strategies using two great videos on
   GoNoodle.  Both "Flow" and "Safe & Calm" guides students through the
   relaxation process.  Students enjoyed getting to lay down and close
   their eyes on the carpet!

   at home over the summer!  Check out the following information:

Career Videos

   During the month of May we are focusing on careers.  I thought it would
   be a fun idea to have parents share their careers, but organizing
   schedules for speakers would disrupt our normal classroom routines and
   sounded a little overwhelming.  Then a lightbulb inside me went off!
   What if I used our emphasis on technology to help share our parent's
   careers???
   I created a private youtube channel and invited parents to upload short
   2-3 minute videos using the criteria below.  Then I had students log in
   and peruse the videos, increasing both engagement and differentiation
   for their unique interests.  I sent home the following letter to
   parents to enlist their help:

   [Screen%2BShot%2B2015-05-21%2Bat%2B10.55.06%2BAM.jpg]
   Since not all careers are represented, I supplemented with additional
   careers using Kidsgov's TeacherTube channel.  Here you can watch
   additional kid friendly videos on a variety of careers.

Careers Taboo

   In third grade we played Careers Taboo (you can download the cards
   here) to introduce the topic of careers! I split the class into 2 teams
   and had them sit in a line.  The student at the front of the line would
   draw a card and try to describe the career on the card without saying
   any of the "hush" words.  Their team had 30 seconds to guess the name
   of the career.  While they were describing the career, the student at
   the front of the line on the opposing team would look over their should
   to make sure they weren't saying any of the off-limit words.  Teams
   were awarded points by guessing correctly in the time limit.  If a team
   was not able to guess the career, the other team had an opportunity to
   steal.  Each team took turns describing and guessing.  We had a great
   time and there were lots of laughs to the difficulty of not saying the
   hush words!
