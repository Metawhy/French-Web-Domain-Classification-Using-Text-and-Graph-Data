   AAC (Advanced Audio Coding)

   AAC is one of the most commonly-supported Bluetooth codecs in the
   wireless headphone and speaker markets. It’s also the default audio
   compression codec used by Apple’s iTunes and YouTube, and is supported
   across both iPhone and Android smartphones.
   Active Noise Cancellation

   Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) reduces unwanted sound by the addition
   of a second sound wave specifically designed to cancel out the first.
   This basically results in no sound at all as it reaches unwanted sound
   even at the lowest frequencies.

   Passive noise cancellation is done by means of insulating filters and
   works best on the middle to high frequencies. It does not work on the
   lower frequencies meaning that some sound can still be heard.
   Active 'v' Passive Speakers

   So, what's the difference?

   Active speakers have an in-built power amplifier and just need a power
   cable (or battery) to operate. Passive speakers require an external
   power amplifier to operate.

   In short, you need an amplifier for passive speakers, you don't with
   active speakers.
   Airplay

   Apple AirPlay is found on all Apple devices. It lets you share videos,
   photos, music, and more from Apple devices to your Apple TV, favorite
   speakers, and some smart TVs.
   AKG K-1000

   The AKG K-1000 headphone has been around since about 1990. It is
   extremely high performance. AKG described it as an "ear speaker".

   Some say that it feels like you can reach out and touch the sound they
   produce, such is their visceral quality.
   Analogue 'v' Digital Signal Processing

   Most modern systems use Digital Signal Processing. DSP samples analogue
   soundwaves into a limited set of numbers and records them. The overuse
   of DSP can result in an overcompressed unnatural sound and the
   translation and reassembly of data make digital devices prone to loss
   of quality.

   All iFi products use Analogue Signal Processing as we believe it is
   better suited to audio. ASP does not cause signal quality to be lost as
   it records waveforms as they are and produces a more natural sound.
   Analogue 'v' Digital Volume Control

   For cost and convenience, modern DAC chips have a built-in digital
   volume control. The drawback is that a digital volume control works by
   'truncating' the signal. Or 'chopping Bits' of resolution. For a 16-Bit
   music file at 50% volume level means the listener is actually listening
   to 14.5-Bits!

   All iFi products bypass the digital volume control and use a separate
   analogue volume control which does not 'lose Bits' so a 16-Bit file
   stays unchanged which delivers maximum resolution.

   Losing Bits of resolution (quality) is like having missing pixels on a
   computer or TV screen.
   Apple CCK and Android OTG

   So, why don't we provide these two cables with our products?

   The Apple CCK cable can only be purchased from Apple. We can't make one
   ourselves as it has a special chip in the cable that we'd need to use
   for them to actually work with Apple hardware. Sadly, Apple has not
   released this chip to anyone.

   We can and do make two versions of an Android OTG cable - Type C and
   micro.
   aptX

   aptX Bluetooth transmission is found in most Android phones, media
   players, Apple computers (macOS on iMacs and MacBooks) and on
   higher-quality Bluetooth headphones. It is not available on iOS
   (iPhones and iPads use Advanced Audio Codec).
   aptX LL

   aptX™ Low Latency audio ensures your Bluetooth® wireless enabled device
   can deliver sound in sync with visual media. It reduces delay and
   improves end-to-end speed of the audio transmission, resulting in a
   high-quality, synchronised user experience.

   With aptX™ Low Latency you can enjoy the freedom of wireless for
   applications such as gaming and watching videos.
   ASP v DSP

   Most modern systems use DSP - Digital Signal Processing.

   DSP samples analogue soundwaves into a limited set of numbers and
   records them. The overuse of DSP can result in an overcompressed
   unnatural sound and the translation and reassembly of data make digital
   devices prone to loss of quality.

   All iFi products use Analogue Signal Processing as we believe it is
   better suited to audio. ASP does not cause signal quality to be lost as
   it records waveforms as they are and produces a more natural sound.
   Balanced audio

   This is a type of audio circuitry topology that uses individual left &
   right channels.

   It is a superior method to the single-ended circuit approach. Balanced
   circuits reduce noise and crosstalk.

   While single-ended is used by most at this price level, iFi is
   implementing balanced circuits across the Zen range which is quite a
   step-up.
   Balanced

   This is a type of audio circuitry topology that uses individual left &
   right channels.

   It is a superior method to the single-ended circuit approach. Balanced
   circuits reduce noise and crosstalk. Less Interefence - clearer sound.

   You normally find this set-up in products at the higher end of the
   spectrum such as the Pro iCAN but iFi is now using it across its
   product ranges to produce interference free audio.
   Balanced 'v' Unbalanced

   Let's talk headphone cables.

   An unbalanced headphone cable has a left + and right + wire, for each
   respective side. The other, the third - wire is shared by both left &
   right channels. As this is shared, this gives rise to undesired
   coupling noise which is commonly referred to as 'crosstalk.'

   A balanced cable has the same left + and right +. But it has a separate
   left - and right -. With totally separate wiring 'crosstalk' is
   negligible.

   Therefore, a balanced connection is the superior headphone wiring
   configuration.
   Bit-Perfect

   If a file is "Bit Perfect' it means it has stayed the same. For
   example, if a PCM file is played through a DAC to improve the sound
   quality and the DAC does not change the file format. The file is 'Bit
   Perfect'.
   Bluetooth 5.0®

   This is the latest version of the Bluetooth wireless commnunication
   standard.

   Its main benefits are improved speed and greater range - it's faster
   and can operate over greater distances than older versions of
   Bluetooth. You can find out more here.
   Busbar

   A busbar is simply a conductor through which current flows.
   CD Transport

   A CD transport concentrates on reading the information held on a
   compact disc without expending effort in turning that digital signal
   into an analogue output, unlike a CD player. All you need to do is add
   an external DAC.
   Class D Amplifier

   A class-D amplifier or switching amplifier is an electronic amplifier
   in which the amplifying devices operate as electronic switches, and not
   as linear gain devices as in other amplifiers. Just like SMPS (Switch
   Mode Power Supplies), standard Class D amplifiers have an inherent
   noise issue due to their 'switching' nature.
   Common Noise Filter

   The common noise filter cuts out most noise gremlins found in typical
   audio systems such as RFI/EMI.
   DAC (Digital-to-Analogue Converter)

   DACs convert digital information, stored or streamed by computers, into
   music we can hear through speakers or headphones.

   Every device that's a source of digital sound has a built-in DAC (TVs,
   games consoles, CD players, phones, portable music players etc).
   Dedicated external DACs sound much better than standard DACs used in
   digital devices such as phones.
   DAP (Digital Audio Player)

   A DAP is a device like an iPod or an MP3 player that stores and/or
   plays back music digitally.
   DAW (Digital Audio Workstation)

   A digital audio workstation (DAW) is an electronic device or
   application used for recording, editing and producing audio files. It's
   basically a mixing desk.
   Dolby Digital

   Dolby digital is one of the most popular formats for surround sound.
   It's used by DVD's and Netflix.

   It is a compressed format, so the newer uncompressed formats sound
   better.
   DoP

   The DoP protocol is a method for transferring DSD Audio over PCM. DoP
   simply uses PCM frames as a carrier for the native DSD data. A DSD
   stream can be carried over a lower data stream and will be completely
   unchanged at the end of the process.
   DSD (Direct Stream Digital)

   DSD is a very high-quality digital audio format that's even better than
   CD quality. The higher the 'DSD rate' – DSD64, 128, 256, 512 and 1024 -
   the greater the amount of music information available, which means
   better sound quality.

   Files can be remastered to higher file rates to improve sound quality.
   The pinnacle of this is DSD1024. Not many machines out there are
   capable of this feat.
   DSP (Digital Signal Processing)

   Digital signal processing (DSP) is the use of digital processing, such
   as by computers or more specialized digital signal processors, to
   perform a wide variety of signal processing operations. When it comes
   to audio the overuse of DSP can result in an over-compressed, unnatural
   sound.
   DTS

   DTS is a company which licences codecs. They dominate the physical disc
   market with DTS5.1 and DTS Master Audio.
   Electrostatic headphones

   Electrostatic headphones work completely differently than conventional
   "dynamic" or "moving coil" headphones.

   Dynamic headphones have a coil of wire inside a magnet. This wire coil
   is glued to a stiff cone that's held in place with springy suspension.
   Current passes through this coil and electromagnetism creates force on
   the coil while in the field of the magnet. The resulting force vibrates
   the coil which, as it is glued to to a heavy cone, moves the entire
   set-up in and out and creates sound.

   Electrostatics place a non-moving static electric charge on an ultra
   thin film that floats between two metal plates. When audio voltages are
   applied across the plates, static cling and repulsion cause the film to
   move by itself. There is no contact.

   This process requires very high voltages and special amplifiers to
   drive them which is where the Pro iESL comes in.
   EMI (Electromagnetic Interference)

   EMI is a type of interference caused by errant and unwanted
   electromagnetic waves that are received and amplified by an audio
   system. They cause some of the annoying 'audio gremlins' we often talk
   about.
   F.A.S.T (Full range And Super Tweeter)

   This is basically a super tweeter. A speaker driver intended to produce
   ultra-high frequencies in a multi-driver loudspeaker system. They are
   used to supplement the sound of tweeters by reproducing frequencies
   which the tweeter may produce only with a narrow polar output, or
   perhaps with distortion.
   File formats

   MP3 – this is the most popular format, every device in the world can
   use it.

   DSD – Direct Stream Digital is a very high-quality audio format, better
   than CD quality. The higher the number (sample rate), the better the
   recording - DSD64, 128, 256, 512 and 1024.

   PCM - Pulse Code Modulation is the most common format for CDs and DVDs.

   DXD - Digital eXtreme Definition is a very high-quality PCM format. It
   was developed to edit hi-res (high quality) recordings recorded in DSD.
   Filters

   Filters are used in music to alter the harmonic content of a signal,
   which changes its timbre or sound.

   Just as using a coloured filter on a camera lens will alter the look of
   the resulting photograph to set the right mood, filters work in a
   similar way in audio.
   Gain

   Gain is the amount of increase in audio signal strength. Gain is often
   expressed in decibels (dB).
   Galvanic Isolation

   Galvanic isolation is a design technique that separates electrical
   circuits to eliminate stray currents that contain noise. Signals can
   pass between galvanically isolated circuits, but stray currents, such
   as differences in ground potential or currents induced by AC power, do
   not pass. This means little or no noise interference to the audio
   signal from stray currents.
   Ground Loops

   In an electrical system, a Ground or Earth loop occurs when two points
   of an audio system both have a ground reference which causes a
   'potential voltage difference' between them. Ground loops are a major
   cause of the noise, hum, and interference in audio, video, and computer
   systems.
   HWA

   HWA is Bluetooth® wireless audio powered by LHDC™ and used by Huawei.

   LHDC™ is codec developed by Savitech and stands for 'low latency and
   high definition' audio. Compared to standard Bluetooth®, it allows 3
   times more musical date to be transmitted.
   IEMs

   IEMs stands for In-Ear Monitors.

   These fit inside your ear. You've been using them for years. You just
   called them something else.

   You will also see these referred to as earphones, ear buds and CIEMs.
   CIEMs are Custom In-Ear Monitors - IEMs made specifically to fit your
   ear shape.
   JAS Hi-Res logo

   When you see the Japan Audio Society (JAS) Hi-Res logo on a product it
   means that has this certification and conforms to the high standards
   for high resolution music put in place by the JAS consortium – to which
   the largest global electronics manufacturers and the biggest music
   labels have all subscribed.
   Koss

   Founded way back in 1958, Koss now produce a wide range of headphones
   to cater for varying tastes. One of their most acclaimed creations is
   the ESP950, over electrostatic ear headphones which retailed at about
   $999.
   LDAC

   LDAC is an audio coding technology developed by Sony, which allows
   streaming audio over Bluetooth connections up to 990 kbit/s at 24
   bit/96 kHz (also called high-resolution audio).

   It is used in Sony headphones, smartphones, portable media players,
   active speakers and home theaters.

   LDAC is a lossy codec which means is disgards some of musical info to
   make the file smaller.
   Linear Power Supply

   A linear power supply design applies the AC line voltage to a power
   transformer to raise or lower the voltage before being applied to the
   regulator circuitry. They have very little output noise.
   Lossy v Lossless

   Lossless and lossy compression are terms that describe whether or not,
   in the compression of a file, all original data can be recovered when
   the file is uncompressed.

   With lossless compression, every single bit of data that was originally
   in the file remains after the file is uncompressed.

   On the other hand, lossy compression reduces a file by permanently
   eliminating certain information. Lossy audio files do not retain the
   natural authenticity of the original.
   MQA (Master Quality Authenticated)

   MQA is an award-winning British technology that delivers the sound of
   the original master recording. The master MQA file is fully
   authenticated and is small enough to stream or download. More here.
   NAS (Network Attached Storage)

   Network-attached storage (NAS) is dedicated file storage that enables
   multiple users and client devices to retrieve data from centralized
   disk capacity.

   Users on a local area network (LAN) access the shared storage via a
   standard Ethernet connection. NAS devices typically do not have a
   keyboard or display and are configured and managed with an app.
   Native playback

   Native playback simply means that the file format has not been changed.

   You wanted to listen in PCM, you'll still be listening in PCM. The DAC
   does not change the format of the original file.
   Noisebusters!

   Reference to the 1984 film Ghostbusters. Four guys, a girl and ghosts.
   And proton guns that would destroy the world if you crossed the
   streams. Watch this.
   Omotesando

   Omotesandō is known as one of the foremost 'architectural showcase'
   streets in the world, featuring a multitude of fashion flagship stores
   within a short distance of each other.

   These include the Louis Vuitton store (Jun Aoki, 2002), Tod's (Toyo
   Ito, 2004), Dior (SANAA, 2004), Omotesandō Hills (Tadao Ando, 2005) and
   Gyre (MVRDV, 2007), amongst others. More here.
   Orpheus

   The Sennheiser Orpheus HE90 are legendary headphones created in 1991
   and limited to 300 pairs. They came with their very own valve amp and
   cost $16,000. Phew!
   Polarity

   In simple terms, polarity refers to the way a signal flows.

   Audio signals generally flow one way, like DC current, and have
   positive polarity. Inverting the polarity can have a negative impact on
   sound and equipment.
   Pulse Load

   A 'load' refers to a current drain that is applied to a battery. For
   example, charging the flash in a camera. The term 'Pulse Load'
   indicates that the load is automatically applied for a specific period
   of time, then disconnected without user intervention.
   RFI (Radio-frequency interference)

   Radio-frequency interference (RFI) is very similar to electromagnetic
   interference (EMI) but is found in the radio frequency spectrum. It is
   another source of irritatiing, unwanted noise often talked about as an
   'audio gremlin'.

   Top tip: just don't add water.
   Shigeru Ban

   Shigeru Ban (坂 茂 Ban Shigeru, born 5 August 1957) is a Japanese
   architect, known for his innovative work with paper, particularly
   recycled cardboard tubes used to quickly and efficiently house disaster
   victims.

   He was profiled by Time magazine in their projection of 21st-century
   innovators in the field of architecture and design. Find out more here.
   Switch Mode Power Supplies (SMPS)

   A switched-mode power supply is an electronic power supply that
   incorporates a switching regulator to convert electrical power
   efficiently. It transfers power from a DC or AC source to DC loads,
   such as a personal computer, while converting voltage and current
   characteristics.

   Switch-mode power supplies are widely used because of the advantages
   they offer in terms of size, weight, cost, efficiency and overall
   performance. They are in themselves noisy and were not designed with
   audio in mind.
   Solid-state 'v' Tubes

   A solid-state amplifier uses electronics such as diodes and transistors
   to amplify the music signal. A tube amp uses valves/vacuum tubes to do
   the same job.

   There is a noticeable sound difference between the two methods. Some
   feel that tube amps create a warmer, more musical tone. Some companies
   choose to build 'hybrid' models that combine the two methods.
   Soundstage

   So, what is soundstage?

   Imagine yourself in a small theater, 10 rows from the front, dead
   center, watching an orchestra perform on stage. Now close your eyes.
   This is the 'sound stage'.

   In audio speak, it is an imaginary 3D space created by the high-quality
   reproduction of sound in a stereo speaker system. In other words, the
   soundstage allows the listener to hear the placement of the orchestra
   vis-a-vis instruments when listening to a given piece of music.
   Spotify Premium

   Spotify Premium allows you to listen better quality music. It's all
   about bitrates. The bitrate is the amount of data processed over a
   certain amount of time. The higher the bitrate, the better the quality.

   On normal Spotify you listen at 96kbps, the 'standard' bitrate on
   mobile or at 160kbps, 'standard quality' on desktop and 'high quality'
   on mobile.

   With Spotify Premium, you get 320kbps which is 'high quality' on
   desktop and 'extreme quality' on mobile. Basically, more bitrates for
   your buck.
   Square wave

   The square wave pattern is what is desired in audio. It contain more
   harmonic content than a sine wave or a wave full of distortion and
   jitter.
   Tadao Ando

   Tadao Ando (安藤 忠雄 Andō Tadao, born 13 September 1941) is a Japanese
   self-taught architect whose approach to architecture and landscape was
   categorized by architectural historian Francesco Dal Co as "critical
   regionalism".

   Tidal Masters

   Tidal is a subscription-based audio streaming platform, similar to
   Apple Music and Spotify, but with lossless-quality audio. Tidal Masters
   is the section with the highest-fidelity music streamed including some
   files in partnership with MQA.

   Lossless-quality means that no music quality is lost in this format.
   USB Audio

   USB audio is a digital audio connection used to send digital music from
   your computer to a digital to analogue converter (DAC). Usually
   computer manufacturers spend most of the overall budget on the
   processors and screen, leaving minimal budget for the built-in DAC and
   audio outputs.
   Volumetric Efficiency

   In electronics, volumetric efficiency quantifies the performance of
   some electronic function per unit volume, usually in as small a space
   as possible.
   ZEN

   Zen emphasizes rigorous self-control, meditation-practice, insight into
   the nature of things and the personal expression of this insight in
   daily life, especially for the benefit of others. Discover more here.

Enjoy. Your way.

   Chill with the best of both worlds.

   Analogue – connect via RCA to amps or active speakers or via the 4.4mm
   output to amps/speakers with a balanced input.

   Digital – use the optical and coaxial connections to connect to
   anything with a built-in DAC and corresponding digital input; your TV,
   an AV amp or an external DAC in your hi-fi set-up.

   Mobile Content

Balanced design is special indeed.

   The analogue output stage is balanced, not normally seen in DACs at
   this price point. Balanced means less noise interference/crosstalk.
   This equals more ZEN in our book.

   It has RCA and balanced outputs at HiFi standard level; 2V SE and 4V
   BAL and thus is compatible with both HiFi and Pro systems.

   All underpinned by high-quality circuit components such as C0G
   capacitors from TDK. All fed by a precision low-noise power supply from
   Texas Instruments to make this a rare entry-priced beastie.

   The iFi Bluetooth® implementation does not use a standard SOC (System
   On a Chip) as seen elsewhere. It uses a combination of quality elements
   to extract the most from each stage. The Qualcomm chip routes the raw,
   digital Bluetooth® signal to a specialised Sabre DAC chip to convert
   the signal from digital to analogue – any jitter is eliminated using
   our GMT femto-precision clock system to deliver Bluetooth® that is a
   cut above.

   The very newest Qualcomm 5100 series running Bluetooth5.0 puts others
   in the shade. This is an extremely low power, premium-tier system on a
   chip specifically designed for use in audio devices. This processes the
   data and delivers high-quality wireless streaming over Bluetooth®.

   Discrete ESS Sabre Hyperstream DAC chipset with time domain jitter
   eliminator, discrete oscillator and 112dB dynamic range for discerning
   listeners.

   One of the key advantages of the ESS Sabre DAC chip is its Hyperstream
   architecture with integrated Time Domain Jitter Eliminator, which helps
   to deliver vanishingly low distortion and high dynamic range

   This OV series operational amplifier is another example of an top-notch
   component used to get the best sound quality out of our products.

   Learn more here.

   We use C0G (class 1 ceramic) capacitors from TDK. These capacitors
   offer high stability and low losses for resonant circuit application
   and are a perfect addition to our products.

   This is a type of audio circuitry topology that uses individual left &
   right channels.

   It is a superior method to the single-ended circuit approach. Balanced
   circuits reduce noise and crosstalk. Less Interefence – clearer sound.

   You normally find this set-up in products at the higher end of the
   spectrum such as the Pro iCAN but iFi is now using it across its
   product ranges to produce interference free audio.

   AAC (Advanced Audio Coding)

   AAC is one of the most commonly-supported Bluetooth codecs in the
   wireless headphone and speaker markets. It’s also the default audio
   compression codec used by Apple’s iTunes and YouTube, and is supported
   across both iPhone and Android smartphones.
   Active Noise Cancellation

   Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) reduces unwanted sound by the addition
   of a second sound wave specifically designed to cancel out the first.
   This basically results in no sound at all as it reaches unwanted sound
   even at the lowest frequencies.

   Passive noise cancellation is done by means of insulating filters and
   works best on the middle to high frequencies. It does not work on the
   lower frequencies meaning that some sound can still be heard.
   Active 'v' Passive Speakers

   So, what's the difference?

   Active speakers have an in-built power amplifier and just need a power
   cable (or battery) to operate. Passive speakers require an external
   power amplifier to operate.

   In short, you need an amplifier for passive speakers, you don't with
   active speakers.
   Airplay

   Apple AirPlay is found on all Apple devices. It lets you share videos,
   photos, music, and more from Apple devices to your Apple TV, favorite
   speakers, and some smart TVs.
   AKG K-1000

   The AKG K-1000 headphone has been around since about 1990. It is
   extremely high performance. AKG described it as an "ear speaker".

   Some say that it feels like you can reach out and touch the sound they
   produce, such is their visceral quality.
   Analogue 'v' Digital Signal Processing

   Most modern systems use Digital Signal Processing. DSP samples analogue
   soundwaves into a limited set of numbers and records them. The overuse
   of DSP can result in an overcompressed unnatural sound and the
   translation and reassembly of data make digital devices prone to loss
   of quality.

   All iFi products use Analogue Signal Processing as we believe it is
   better suited to audio. ASP does not cause signal quality to be lost as
   it records waveforms as they are and produces a more natural sound.
   Analogue 'v' Digital Volume Control

   For cost and convenience, modern DAC chips have a built-in digital
   volume control. The drawback is that a digital volume control works by
   'truncating' the signal. Or 'chopping Bits' of resolution. For a 16-Bit
   music file at 50% volume level means the listener is actually listening
   to 14.5-Bits!

   All iFi products bypass the digital volume control and use a separate
   analogue volume control which does not 'lose Bits' so a 16-Bit file
   stays unchanged which delivers maximum resolution.

   Losing Bits of resolution (quality) is like having missing pixels on a
   computer or TV screen.
   Apple CCK and Android OTG

   So, why don't we provide these two cables with our products?

   The Apple CCK cable can only be purchased from Apple. We can't make one
   ourselves as it has a special chip in the cable that we'd need to use
   for them to actually work with Apple hardware. Sadly, Apple has not
   released this chip to anyone.

   We can and do make two versions of an Android OTG cable - Type C and
   micro.
   aptX

   aptX Bluetooth transmission is found in most Android phones, media
   players, Apple computers (macOS on iMacs and MacBooks) and on
   higher-quality Bluetooth headphones. It is not available on iOS
   (iPhones and iPads use Advanced Audio Codec).
   aptX LL

   aptX™ Low Latency audio ensures your Bluetooth® wireless enabled device
   can deliver sound in sync with visual media. It reduces delay and
   improves end-to-end speed of the audio transmission, resulting in a
   high-quality, synchronised user experience.

   With aptX™ Low Latency you can enjoy the freedom of wireless for
   applications such as gaming and watching videos.
   ASP v DSP

   Most modern systems use DSP - Digital Signal Processing.

   DSP samples analogue soundwaves into a limited set of numbers and
   records them. The overuse of DSP can result in an overcompressed
   unnatural sound and the translation and reassembly of data make digital
   devices prone to loss of quality.

   All iFi products use Analogue Signal Processing as we believe it is
   better suited to audio. ASP does not cause signal quality to be lost as
   it records waveforms as they are and produces a more natural sound.
   Balanced audio

   This is a type of audio circuitry topology that uses individual left &
   right channels.

   It is a superior method to the single-ended circuit approach. Balanced
   circuits reduce noise and crosstalk.

   While single-ended is used by most at this price level, iFi is
   implementing balanced circuits across the Zen range which is quite a
   step-up.
   Balanced

   This is a type of audio circuitry topology that uses individual left &
   right channels.

   It is a superior method to the single-ended circuit approach. Balanced
   circuits reduce noise and crosstalk. Less Interefence - clearer sound.

   You normally find this set-up in products at the higher end of the
   spectrum such as the Pro iCAN but iFi is now using it across its
   product ranges to produce interference free audio.
   Balanced 'v' Unbalanced

   Let's talk headphone cables.

   An unbalanced headphone cable has a left + and right + wire, for each
   respective side. The other, the third - wire is shared by both left &
   right channels. As this is shared, this gives rise to undesired
   coupling noise which is commonly referred to as 'crosstalk.'

   A balanced cable has the same left + and right +. But it has a separate
   left - and right -. With totally separate wiring 'crosstalk' is
   negligible.

   Therefore, a balanced connection is the superior headphone wiring
   configuration.
   Bit-Perfect

   If a file is "Bit Perfect' it means it has stayed the same. For
   example, if a PCM file is played through a DAC to improve the sound
   quality and the DAC does not change the file format. The file is 'Bit
   Perfect'.
   Bluetooth 5.0®

   This is the latest version of the Bluetooth wireless commnunication
   standard.

   Its main benefits are improved speed and greater range - it's faster
   and can operate over greater distances than older versions of
   Bluetooth. You can find out more here.
   Busbar

   A busbar is simply a conductor through which current flows.
   CD Transport

   A CD transport concentrates on reading the information held on a
   compact disc without expending effort in turning that digital signal
   into an analogue output, unlike a CD player. All you need to do is add
   an external DAC.
   Class D Amplifier

   A class-D amplifier or switching amplifier is an electronic amplifier
   in which the amplifying devices operate as electronic switches, and not
   as linear gain devices as in other amplifiers. Just like SMPS (Switch
   Mode Power Supplies), standard Class D amplifiers have an inherent
   noise issue due to their 'switching' nature.
   Common Noise Filter

   The common noise filter cuts out most noise gremlins found in typical
   audio systems such as RFI/EMI.
   DAC (Digital-to-Analogue Converter)

   DACs convert digital information, stored or streamed by computers, into
   music we can hear through speakers or headphones.

   Every device that's a source of digital sound has a built-in DAC (TVs,
   games consoles, CD players, phones, portable music players etc).
   Dedicated external DACs sound much better than standard DACs used in
   digital devices such as phones.
   DAP (Digital Audio Player)

   A DAP is a device like an iPod or an MP3 player that stores and/or
   plays back music digitally.
   DAW (Digital Audio Workstation)

   A digital audio workstation (DAW) is an electronic device or
   application used for recording, editing and producing audio files. It's
   basically a mixing desk.
   Dolby Digital

   Dolby digital is one of the most popular formats for surround sound.
   It's used by DVD's and Netflix.

   It is a compressed format, so the newer uncompressed formats sound
   better.
   DoP

   The DoP protocol is a method for transferring DSD Audio over PCM. DoP
   simply uses PCM frames as a carrier for the native DSD data. A DSD
   stream can be carried over a lower data stream and will be completely
   unchanged at the end of the process.
   DSD (Direct Stream Digital)

   DSD is a very high-quality digital audio format that's even better than
   CD quality. The higher the 'DSD rate' – DSD64, 128, 256, 512 and 1024 -
   the greater the amount of music information available, which means
   better sound quality.

   Files can be remastered to higher file rates to improve sound quality.
   The pinnacle of this is DSD1024. Not many machines out there are
   capable of this feat.
   DSP (Digital Signal Processing)

   Digital signal processing (DSP) is the use of digital processing, such
   as by computers or more specialized digital signal processors, to
   perform a wide variety of signal processing operations. When it comes
   to audio the overuse of DSP can result in an over-compressed, unnatural
   sound.
   DTS

   DTS is a company which licences codecs. They dominate the physical disc
   market with DTS5.1 and DTS Master Audio.
   Electrostatic headphones

   Electrostatic headphones work completely differently than conventional
   "dynamic" or "moving coil" headphones.

   Dynamic headphones have a coil of wire inside a magnet. This wire coil
   is glued to a stiff cone that's held in place with springy suspension.
   Current passes through this coil and electromagnetism creates force on
   the coil while in the field of the magnet. The resulting force vibrates
   the coil which, as it is glued to to a heavy cone, moves the entire
   set-up in and out and creates sound.

   Electrostatics place a non-moving static electric charge on an ultra
   thin film that floats between two metal plates. When audio voltages are
   applied across the plates, static cling and repulsion cause the film to
   move by itself. There is no contact.

   This process requires very high voltages and special amplifiers to
   drive them which is where the Pro iESL comes in.
   EMI (Electromagnetic Interference)

   EMI is a type of interference caused by errant and unwanted
   electromagnetic waves that are received and amplified by an audio
   system. They cause some of the annoying 'audio gremlins' we often talk
   about.
   F.A.S.T (Full range And Super Tweeter)

   This is basically a super tweeter. A speaker driver intended to produce
   ultra-high frequencies in a multi-driver loudspeaker system. They are
   used to supplement the sound of tweeters by reproducing frequencies
   which the tweeter may produce only with a narrow polar output, or
   perhaps with distortion.
   File formats

   MP3 – this is the most popular format, every device in the world can
   use it.

   DSD – Direct Stream Digital is a very high-quality audio format, better
   than CD quality. The higher the number (sample rate), the better the
   recording - DSD64, 128, 256, 512 and 1024.

   PCM - Pulse Code Modulation is the most common format for CDs and DVDs.

   DXD - Digital eXtreme Definition is a very high-quality PCM format. It
   was developed to edit hi-res (high quality) recordings recorded in DSD.
   Filters

   Filters are used in music to alter the harmonic content of a signal,
   which changes its timbre or sound.

   Just as using a coloured filter on a camera lens will alter the look of
   the resulting photograph to set the right mood, filters work in a
   similar way in audio.
   Gain

   Gain is the amount of increase in audio signal strength. Gain is often
   expressed in decibels (dB).
   Galvanic Isolation

   Galvanic isolation is a design technique that separates electrical
   circuits to eliminate stray currents that contain noise. Signals can
   pass between galvanically isolated circuits, but stray currents, such
   as differences in ground potential or currents induced by AC power, do
   not pass. This means little or no noise interference to the audio
   signal from stray currents.
   Ground Loops

   In an electrical system, a Ground or Earth loop occurs when two points
   of an audio system both have a ground reference which causes a
   'potential voltage difference' between them. Ground loops are a major
   cause of the noise, hum, and interference in audio, video, and computer
   systems.
   HWA

   HWA is Bluetooth® wireless audio powered by LHDC™ and used by Huawei.

   LHDC™ is codec developed by Savitech and stands for 'low latency and
   high definition' audio. Compared to standard Bluetooth®, it allows 3
   times more musical date to be transmitted.
   IEMs

   IEMs stands for In-Ear Monitors.

   These fit inside your ear. You've been using them for years. You just
   called them something else.

   You will also see these referred to as earphones, ear buds and CIEMs.
   CIEMs are Custom In-Ear Monitors - IEMs made specifically to fit your
   ear shape.
   JAS Hi-Res logo

   When you see the Japan Audio Society (JAS) Hi-Res logo on a product it
   means that has this certification and conforms to the high standards
   for high resolution music put in place by the JAS consortium – to which
   the largest global electronics manufacturers and the biggest music
   labels have all subscribed.
   Koss

   Founded way back in 1958, Koss now produce a wide range of headphones
   to cater for varying tastes. One of their most acclaimed creations is
   the ESP950, over electrostatic ear headphones which retailed at about
   $999.
   LDAC

   LDAC is an audio coding technology developed by Sony, which allows
   streaming audio over Bluetooth connections up to 990 kbit/s at 24
   bit/96 kHz (also called high-resolution audio).

   It is used in Sony headphones, smartphones, portable media players,
   active speakers and home theaters.

   LDAC is a lossy codec which means is disgards some of musical info to
   make the file smaller.
   Linear Power Supply

   A linear power supply design applies the AC line voltage to a power
   transformer to raise or lower the voltage before being applied to the
   regulator circuitry. They have very little output noise.
   Lossy v Lossless

   Lossless and lossy compression are terms that describe whether or not,
   in the compression of a file, all original data can be recovered when
   the file is uncompressed.

   With lossless compression, every single bit of data that was originally
   in the file remains after the file is uncompressed.

   On the other hand, lossy compression reduces a file by permanently
   eliminating certain information. Lossy audio files do not retain the
   natural authenticity of the original.
   MQA (Master Quality Authenticated)

   MQA is an award-winning British technology that delivers the sound of
   the original master recording. The master MQA file is fully
   authenticated and is small enough to stream or download. More here.
   NAS (Network Attached Storage)

   Network-attached storage (NAS) is dedicated file storage that enables
   multiple users and client devices to retrieve data from centralized
   disk capacity.

   Users on a local area network (LAN) access the shared storage via a
   standard Ethernet connection. NAS devices typically do not have a
   keyboard or display and are configured and managed with an app.
   Native playback

   Native playback simply means that the file format has not been changed.

   You wanted to listen in PCM, you'll still be listening in PCM. The DAC
   does not change the format of the original file.
   Noisebusters!

   Reference to the 1984 film Ghostbusters. Four guys, a girl and ghosts.
   And proton guns that would destroy the world if you crossed the
   streams. Watch this.
   Omotesando

   Omotesandō is known as one of the foremost 'architectural showcase'
   streets in the world, featuring a multitude of fashion flagship stores
   within a short distance of each other.

   These include the Louis Vuitton store (Jun Aoki, 2002), Tod's (Toyo
   Ito, 2004), Dior (SANAA, 2004), Omotesandō Hills (Tadao Ando, 2005) and
   Gyre (MVRDV, 2007), amongst others. More here.
   Orpheus

   The Sennheiser Orpheus HE90 are legendary headphones created in 1991
   and limited to 300 pairs. They came with their very own valve amp and
   cost $16,000. Phew!
   Polarity

   In simple terms, polarity refers to the way a signal flows.

   Audio signals generally flow one way, like DC current, and have
   positive polarity. Inverting the polarity can have a negative impact on
   sound and equipment.
   Pulse Load

   A 'load' refers to a current drain that is applied to a battery. For
   example, charging the flash in a camera. The term 'Pulse Load'
   indicates that the load is automatically applied for a specific period
   of time, then disconnected without user intervention.
   RFI (Radio-frequency interference)

   Radio-frequency interference (RFI) is very similar to electromagnetic
   interference (EMI) but is found in the radio frequency spectrum. It is
   another source of irritatiing, unwanted noise often talked about as an
   'audio gremlin'.

   Top tip: just don't add water.
   Shigeru Ban

   Shigeru Ban (坂 茂 Ban Shigeru, born 5 August 1957) is a Japanese
   architect, known for his innovative work with paper, particularly
   recycled cardboard tubes used to quickly and efficiently house disaster
   victims.

   He was profiled by Time magazine in their projection of 21st-century
   innovators in the field of architecture and design. Find out more here.
   Switch Mode Power Supplies (SMPS)

   A switched-mode power supply is an electronic power supply that
   incorporates a switching regulator to convert electrical power
   efficiently. It transfers power from a DC or AC source to DC loads,
   such as a personal computer, while converting voltage and current
   characteristics.

   Switch-mode power supplies are widely used because of the advantages
   they offer in terms of size, weight, cost, efficiency and overall
   performance. They are in themselves noisy and were not designed with
   audio in mind.
   Solid-state 'v' Tubes

   A solid-state amplifier uses electronics such as diodes and transistors
   to amplify the music signal. A tube amp uses valves/vacuum tubes to do
   the same job.

   There is a noticeable sound difference between the two methods. Some
   feel that tube amps create a warmer, more musical tone. Some companies
   choose to build 'hybrid' models that combine the two methods.
   Soundstage

   So, what is soundstage?

   Imagine yourself in a small theater, 10 rows from the front, dead
   center, watching an orchestra perform on stage. Now close your eyes.
   This is the 'sound stage'.

   In audio speak, it is an imaginary 3D space created by the high-quality
   reproduction of sound in a stereo speaker system. In other words, the
   soundstage allows the listener to hear the placement of the orchestra
   vis-a-vis instruments when listening to a given piece of music.
   Spotify Premium

   Spotify Premium allows you to listen better quality music. It's all
   about bitrates. The bitrate is the amount of data processed over a
   certain amount of time. The higher the bitrate, the better the quality.

   On normal Spotify you listen at 96kbps, the 'standard' bitrate on
   mobile or at 160kbps, 'standard quality' on desktop and 'high quality'
   on mobile.

   With Spotify Premium, you get 320kbps which is 'high quality' on
   desktop and 'extreme quality' on mobile. Basically, more bitrates for
   your buck.
   Square wave

   The square wave pattern is what is desired in audio. It contain more
   harmonic content than a sine wave or a wave full of distortion and
   jitter.
   Tadao Ando

   Tadao Ando (安藤 忠雄 Andō Tadao, born 13 September 1941) is a Japanese
   self-taught architect whose approach to architecture and landscape was
   categorized by architectural historian Francesco Dal Co as "critical
   regionalism".

   Tidal Masters

   Tidal is a subscription-based audio streaming platform, similar to
   Apple Music and Spotify, but with lossless-quality audio. Tidal Masters
   is the section with the highest-fidelity music streamed including some
   files in partnership with MQA.

   Lossless-quality means that no music quality is lost in this format.
   USB Audio

   USB audio is a digital audio connection used to send digital music from
   your computer to a digital to analogue converter (DAC). Usually
   computer manufacturers spend most of the overall budget on the
   processors and screen, leaving minimal budget for the built-in DAC and
   audio outputs.
   Volumetric Efficiency

   In electronics, volumetric efficiency quantifies the performance of
   some electronic function per unit volume, usually in as small a space
   as possible.
   ZEN

   Zen emphasizes rigorous self-control, meditation-practice, insight into
   the nature of things and the personal expression of this insight in
   daily life, especially for the benefit of others. Discover more here.

Perfect performer

   It’s Bit Perfect – it doesn’t over or upsample the signal. It’s
   compatible with DTS, DOLBY Digital and DoP signals and offers full HD
   support up to 192KHz.

   Soundtracks rock and games feel immersive. Cracked it.

   The signal goes through 4 comprehensive stages – isolation,
   regeneration, a memory buffer and re-clocking. The restores the
   industry standard ‘square wave’ which represents the desired signal.

   The result is a fully-restored SPDIF signal without jitter.  The sound
   quality now has greater warmth, resolution and dynamic contrast.

   A galvanically isolated SPDIF output means that electrical circuits are
   separated to eliminate stray elements – a signal can pass but nothing
   else. Interference-free audio.

   And with added Reclock® and Regenerate® the signal remains true and
   strong.

   AMR’s Global Master Timing (GMT)/ Memory Buffer System represents a
   total ‘out of the box’ systematic digital solution that solves the
   digital SPDIF jitter once and for all.

   We pride ourselves on giving you Bit-Perfect signal transfer. This
   means the signal remains original and unchanged.

   This device ensures a Bit-Perfect transfer which is highly unusual for
   SPDIF devices. It can handle 44.1 / 48 / 88.2 / 96 / 176.4 / 192kHz; 16
   to 24 Bit, DSD, DoP, and even Dolby Digital and DTS.

Reviews

Ifi Spdif iPurifier the best value for money

   The above product was purchased because of the recommendations by some
   in the music industry whose opinion I respect. I was not disappointed.
   The purifier definitely makes a positive difference when placed at the
   end of a SPDIF cable before a DAC.

   In my opinion there is a bigger cleaner sound, voices and background
   music becomes clearer. One can now enjoy listening to music for hours.

Overview of iFi Audio accessories and filters – does filtering matter?

   This article was born in my head a long time ago, mainly due to
   repeated questions from time to time, whether I had contact with
   filtering devices like iSilencer, Jitterbug etc. But since I run my
   humble blog, I’ve probably got used to most people to a few maxims,
   which I am guided in total not only in the field of audio equipment,
   but generally in life…

Awesome device

   I had a persistent ground loop issue on a high end surround sound
   system.
   I was skeptical this would fix it but it did so instantly with no
   further issues.

   AAC (Advanced Audio Coding)

   AAC is one of the most commonly-supported Bluetooth codecs in the
   wireless headphone and speaker markets. It’s also the default audio
   compression codec used by Apple’s iTunes and YouTube, and is supported
   across both iPhone and Android smartphones.
   Active Noise Cancellation

   Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) reduces unwanted sound by the addition
   of a second sound wave specifically designed to cancel out the first.
   This basically results in no sound at all as it reaches unwanted sound
   even at the lowest frequencies.

   Passive noise cancellation is done by means of insulating filters and
   works best on the middle to high frequencies. It does not work on the
   lower frequencies meaning that some sound can still be heard.
   Active 'v' Passive Speakers

   So, what's the difference?

   Active speakers have an in-built power amplifier and just need a power
   cable (or battery) to operate. Passive speakers require an external
   power amplifier to operate.

   In short, you need an amplifier for passive speakers, you don't with
   active speakers.
   Airplay

   Apple AirPlay is found on all Apple devices. It lets you share videos,
   photos, music, and more from Apple devices to your Apple TV, favorite
   speakers, and some smart TVs.
   AKG K-1000

   The AKG K-1000 headphone has been around since about 1990. It is
   extremely high performance. AKG described it as an "ear speaker".

   Some say that it feels like you can reach out and touch the sound they
   produce, such is their visceral quality.
   Analogue 'v' Digital Signal Processing

   Most modern systems use Digital Signal Processing. DSP samples analogue
   soundwaves into a limited set of numbers and records them. The overuse
   of DSP can result in an overcompressed unnatural sound and the
   translation and reassembly of data make digital devices prone to loss
   of quality.

   All iFi products use Analogue Signal Processing as we believe it is
   better suited to audio. ASP does not cause signal quality to be lost as
   it records waveforms as they are and produces a more natural sound.
   Analogue 'v' Digital Volume Control

   For cost and convenience, modern DAC chips have a built-in digital
   volume control. The drawback is that a digital volume control works by
   'truncating' the signal. Or 'chopping Bits' of resolution. For a 16-Bit
   music file at 50% volume level means the listener is actually listening
   to 14.5-Bits!

   All iFi products bypass the digital volume control and use a separate
   analogue volume control which does not 'lose Bits' so a 16-Bit file
   stays unchanged which delivers maximum resolution.

   Losing Bits of resolution (quality) is like having missing pixels on a
   computer or TV screen.
   Apple CCK and Android OTG

   So, why don't we provide these two cables with our products?

   The Apple CCK cable can only be purchased from Apple. We can't make one
   ourselves as it has a special chip in the cable that we'd need to use
   for them to actually work with Apple hardware. Sadly, Apple has not
   released this chip to anyone.

   We can and do make two versions of an Android OTG cable - Type C and
   micro.
   aptX

   aptX Bluetooth transmission is found in most Android phones, media
   players, Apple computers (macOS on iMacs and MacBooks) and on
   higher-quality Bluetooth headphones. It is not available on iOS
   (iPhones and iPads use Advanced Audio Codec).
   aptX LL

   aptX™ Low Latency audio ensures your Bluetooth® wireless enabled device
   can deliver sound in sync with visual media. It reduces delay and
   improves end-to-end speed of the audio transmission, resulting in a
   high-quality, synchronised user experience.

   With aptX™ Low Latency you can enjoy the freedom of wireless for
   applications such as gaming and watching videos.
   ASP v DSP

   Most modern systems use DSP - Digital Signal Processing.

   DSP samples analogue soundwaves into a limited set of numbers and
   records them. The overuse of DSP can result in an overcompressed
   unnatural sound and the translation and reassembly of data make digital
   devices prone to loss of quality.

   All iFi products use Analogue Signal Processing as we believe it is
   better suited to audio. ASP does not cause signal quality to be lost as
   it records waveforms as they are and produces a more natural sound.
   Balanced audio

   This is a type of audio circuitry topology that uses individual left &
   right channels.

   It is a superior method to the single-ended circuit approach. Balanced
   circuits reduce noise and crosstalk.

   While single-ended is used by most at this price level, iFi is
   implementing balanced circuits across the Zen range which is quite a
   step-up.
   Balanced

   This is a type of audio circuitry topology that uses individual left &
   right channels.

   It is a superior method to the single-ended circuit approach. Balanced
   circuits reduce noise and crosstalk. Less Interefence - clearer sound.

   You normally find this set-up in products at the higher end of the
   spectrum such as the Pro iCAN but iFi is now using it across its
   product ranges to produce interference free audio.
   Balanced 'v' Unbalanced

   Let's talk headphone cables.

   An unbalanced headphone cable has a left + and right + wire, for each
   respective side. The other, the third - wire is shared by both left &
   right channels. As this is shared, this gives rise to undesired
   coupling noise which is commonly referred to as 'crosstalk.'

   A balanced cable has the same left + and right +. But it has a separate
   left - and right -. With totally separate wiring 'crosstalk' is
   negligible.

   Therefore, a balanced connection is the superior headphone wiring
   configuration.
   Bit-Perfect

   If a file is "Bit Perfect' it means it has stayed the same. For
   example, if a PCM file is played through a DAC to improve the sound
   quality and the DAC does not change the file format. The file is 'Bit
   Perfect'.
   Bluetooth 5.0®

   This is the latest version of the Bluetooth wireless commnunication
   standard.

   Its main benefits are improved speed and greater range - it's faster
   and can operate over greater distances than older versions of
   Bluetooth. You can find out more here.
   Busbar

   A busbar is simply a conductor through which current flows.
   CD Transport

   A CD transport concentrates on reading the information held on a
   compact disc without expending effort in turning that digital signal
   into an analogue output, unlike a CD player. All you need to do is add
   an external DAC.
   Class D Amplifier

   A class-D amplifier or switching amplifier is an electronic amplifier
   in which the amplifying devices operate as electronic switches, and not
   as linear gain devices as in other amplifiers. Just like SMPS (Switch
   Mode Power Supplies), standard Class D amplifiers have an inherent
   noise issue due to their 'switching' nature.
   Common Noise Filter

   The common noise filter cuts out most noise gremlins found in typical
   audio systems such as RFI/EMI.
   DAC (Digital-to-Analogue Converter)

   DACs convert digital information, stored or streamed by computers, into
   music we can hear through speakers or headphones.

   Every device that's a source of digital sound has a built-in DAC (TVs,
   games consoles, CD players, phones, portable music players etc).
   Dedicated external DACs sound much better than standard DACs used in
   digital devices such as phones.
   DAP (Digital Audio Player)

   A DAP is a device like an iPod or an MP3 player that stores and/or
   plays back music digitally.
   DAW (Digital Audio Workstation)

   A digital audio workstation (DAW) is an electronic device or
   application used for recording, editing and producing audio files. It's
   basically a mixing desk.
   Dolby Digital

   Dolby digital is one of the most popular formats for surround sound.
   It's used by DVD's and Netflix.

   It is a compressed format, so the newer uncompressed formats sound
   better.
   DoP

   The DoP protocol is a method for transferring DSD Audio over PCM. DoP
   simply uses PCM frames as a carrier for the native DSD data. A DSD
   stream can be carried over a lower data stream and will be completely
   unchanged at the end of the process.
   DSD (Direct Stream Digital)

   DSD is a very high-quality digital audio format that's even better than
   CD quality. The higher the 'DSD rate' – DSD64, 128, 256, 512 and 1024 -
   the greater the amount of music information available, which means
   better sound quality.

   Files can be remastered to higher file rates to improve sound quality.
   The pinnacle of this is DSD1024. Not many machines out there are
   capable of this feat.
   DSP (Digital Signal Processing)

   Digital signal processing (DSP) is the use of digital processing, such
   as by computers or more specialized digital signal processors, to
   perform a wide variety of signal processing operations. When it comes
   to audio the overuse of DSP can result in an over-compressed, unnatural
   sound.
   DTS

   DTS is a company which licences codecs. They dominate the physical disc
   market with DTS5.1 and DTS Master Audio.
   Electrostatic headphones

   Electrostatic headphones work completely differently than conventional
   "dynamic" or "moving coil" headphones.

   Dynamic headphones have a coil of wire inside a magnet. This wire coil
   is glued to a stiff cone that's held in place with springy suspension.
   Current passes through this coil and electromagnetism creates force on
   the coil while in the field of the magnet. The resulting force vibrates
   the coil which, as it is glued to to a heavy cone, moves the entire
   set-up in and out and creates sound.

   Electrostatics place a non-moving static electric charge on an ultra
   thin film that floats between two metal plates. When audio voltages are
   applied across the plates, static cling and repulsion cause the film to
   move by itself. There is no contact.

   This process requires very high voltages and special amplifiers to
   drive them which is where the Pro iESL comes in.
   EMI (Electromagnetic Interference)

   EMI is a type of interference caused by errant and unwanted
   electromagnetic waves that are received and amplified by an audio
   system. They cause some of the annoying 'audio gremlins' we often talk
   about.
   F.A.S.T (Full range And Super Tweeter)

   This is basically a super tweeter. A speaker driver intended to produce
   ultra-high frequencies in a multi-driver loudspeaker system. They are
   used to supplement the sound of tweeters by reproducing frequencies
   which the tweeter may produce only with a narrow polar output, or
   perhaps with distortion.
   File formats

   MP3 – this is the most popular format, every device in the world can
   use it.

   DSD – Direct Stream Digital is a very high-quality audio format, better
   than CD quality. The higher the number (sample rate), the better the
   recording - DSD64, 128, 256, 512 and 1024.

   PCM - Pulse Code Modulation is the most common format for CDs and DVDs.

   DXD - Digital eXtreme Definition is a very high-quality PCM format. It
   was developed to edit hi-res (high quality) recordings recorded in DSD.
   Filters

   Filters are used in music to alter the harmonic content of a signal,
   which changes its timbre or sound.

   Just as using a coloured filter on a camera lens will alter the look of
   the resulting photograph to set the right mood, filters work in a
   similar way in audio.
   Gain

   Gain is the amount of increase in audio signal strength. Gain is often
   expressed in decibels (dB).
   Galvanic Isolation

   Galvanic isolation is a design technique that separates electrical
   circuits to eliminate stray currents that contain noise. Signals can
   pass between galvanically isolated circuits, but stray currents, such
   as differences in ground potential or currents induced by AC power, do
   not pass. This means little or no noise interference to the audio
   signal from stray currents.
   Ground Loops

   In an electrical system, a Ground or Earth loop occurs when two points
   of an audio system both have a ground reference which causes a
   'potential voltage difference' between them. Ground loops are a major
   cause of the noise, hum, and interference in audio, video, and computer
   systems.
   HWA

   HWA is Bluetooth® wireless audio powered by LHDC™ and used by Huawei.

   LHDC™ is codec developed by Savitech and stands for 'low latency and
   high definition' audio. Compared to standard Bluetooth®, it allows 3
   times more musical date to be transmitted.
   IEMs

   IEMs stands for In-Ear Monitors.

   These fit inside your ear. You've been using them for years. You just
   called them something else.

   You will also see these referred to as earphones, ear buds and CIEMs.
   CIEMs are Custom In-Ear Monitors - IEMs made specifically to fit your
   ear shape.
   JAS Hi-Res logo

   When you see the Japan Audio Society (JAS) Hi-Res logo on a product it
   means that has this certification and conforms to the high standards
   for high resolution music put in place by the JAS consortium – to which
   the largest global electronics manufacturers and the biggest music
   labels have all subscribed.
   Koss

   Founded way back in 1958, Koss now produce a wide range of headphones
   to cater for varying tastes. One of their most acclaimed creations is
   the ESP950, over electrostatic ear headphones which retailed at about
   $999.
   LDAC

   LDAC is an audio coding technology developed by Sony, which allows
   streaming audio over Bluetooth connections up to 990 kbit/s at 24
   bit/96 kHz (also called high-resolution audio).

   It is used in Sony headphones, smartphones, portable media players,
   active speakers and home theaters.

   LDAC is a lossy codec which means is disgards some of musical info to
   make the file smaller.
   Linear Power Supply

   A linear power supply design applies the AC line voltage to a power
   transformer to raise or lower the voltage before being applied to the
   regulator circuitry. They have very little output noise.
   Lossy v Lossless

   Lossless and lossy compression are terms that describe whether or not,
   in the compression of a file, all original data can be recovered when
   the file is uncompressed.

   With lossless compression, every single bit of data that was originally
   in the file remains after the file is uncompressed.

   On the other hand, lossy compression reduces a file by permanently
   eliminating certain information. Lossy audio files do not retain the
   natural authenticity of the original.
   MQA (Master Quality Authenticated)

   MQA is an award-winning British technology that delivers the sound of
   the original master recording. The master MQA file is fully
   authenticated and is small enough to stream or download. More here.
   NAS (Network Attached Storage)

   Network-attached storage (NAS) is dedicated file storage that enables
   multiple users and client devices to retrieve data from centralized
   disk capacity.

   Users on a local area network (LAN) access the shared storage via a
   standard Ethernet connection. NAS devices typically do not have a
   keyboard or display and are configured and managed with an app.
   Native playback

   Native playback simply means that the file format has not been changed.

   You wanted to listen in PCM, you'll still be listening in PCM. The DAC
   does not change the format of the original file.
   Noisebusters!

   Reference to the 1984 film Ghostbusters. Four guys, a girl and ghosts.
   And proton guns that would destroy the world if you crossed the
   streams. Watch this.
   Omotesando

   Omotesandō is known as one of the foremost 'architectural showcase'
   streets in the world, featuring a multitude of fashion flagship stores
   within a short distance of each other.

   These include the Louis Vuitton store (Jun Aoki, 2002), Tod's (Toyo
   Ito, 2004), Dior (SANAA, 2004), Omotesandō Hills (Tadao Ando, 2005) and
   Gyre (MVRDV, 2007), amongst others. More here.
   Orpheus

   The Sennheiser Orpheus HE90 are legendary headphones created in 1991
   and limited to 300 pairs. They came with their very own valve amp and
   cost $16,000. Phew!
   Polarity

   In simple terms, polarity refers to the way a signal flows.

   Audio signals generally flow one way, like DC current, and have
   positive polarity. Inverting the polarity can have a negative impact on
   sound and equipment.
   Pulse Load

   A 'load' refers to a current drain that is applied to a battery. For
   example, charging the flash in a camera. The term 'Pulse Load'
   indicates that the load is automatically applied for a specific period
   of time, then disconnected without user intervention.
   RFI (Radio-frequency interference)

   Radio-frequency interference (RFI) is very similar to electromagnetic
   interference (EMI) but is found in the radio frequency spectrum. It is
   another source of irritatiing, unwanted noise often talked about as an
   'audio gremlin'.

   Top tip: just don't add water.
   Shigeru Ban

   Shigeru Ban (坂 茂 Ban Shigeru, born 5 August 1957) is a Japanese
   architect, known for his innovative work with paper, particularly
   recycled cardboard tubes used to quickly and efficiently house disaster
   victims.

   He was profiled by Time magazine in their projection of 21st-century
   innovators in the field of architecture and design. Find out more here.
   Switch Mode Power Supplies (SMPS)

   A switched-mode power supply is an electronic power supply that
   incorporates a switching regulator to convert electrical power
   efficiently. It transfers power from a DC or AC source to DC loads,
   such as a personal computer, while converting voltage and current
   characteristics.

   Switch-mode power supplies are widely used because of the advantages
   they offer in terms of size, weight, cost, efficiency and overall
   performance. They are in themselves noisy and were not designed with
   audio in mind.
   Solid-state 'v' Tubes

   A solid-state amplifier uses electronics such as diodes and transistors
   to amplify the music signal. A tube amp uses valves/vacuum tubes to do
   the same job.

   There is a noticeable sound difference between the two methods. Some
   feel that tube amps create a warmer, more musical tone. Some companies
   choose to build 'hybrid' models that combine the two methods.
   Soundstage

   So, what is soundstage?

   Imagine yourself in a small theater, 10 rows from the front, dead
   center, watching an orchestra perform on stage. Now close your eyes.
   This is the 'sound stage'.

   In audio speak, it is an imaginary 3D space created by the high-quality
   reproduction of sound in a stereo speaker system. In other words, the
   soundstage allows the listener to hear the placement of the orchestra
   vis-a-vis instruments when listening to a given piece of music.
   Spotify Premium

   Spotify Premium allows you to listen better quality music. It's all
   about bitrates. The bitrate is the amount of data processed over a
   certain amount of time. The higher the bitrate, the better the quality.

   On normal Spotify you listen at 96kbps, the 'standard' bitrate on
   mobile or at 160kbps, 'standard quality' on desktop and 'high quality'
   on mobile.

   With Spotify Premium, you get 320kbps which is 'high quality' on
   desktop and 'extreme quality' on mobile. Basically, more bitrates for
   your buck.
   Square wave

   The square wave pattern is what is desired in audio. It contain more
   harmonic content than a sine wave or a wave full of distortion and
   jitter.
   Tadao Ando

   Tadao Ando (安藤 忠雄 Andō Tadao, born 13 September 1941) is a Japanese
   self-taught architect whose approach to architecture and landscape was
   categorized by architectural historian Francesco Dal Co as "critical
   regionalism".

   Tidal Masters

   Tidal is a subscription-based audio streaming platform, similar to
   Apple Music and Spotify, but with lossless-quality audio. Tidal Masters
   is the section with the highest-fidelity music streamed including some
   files in partnership with MQA.

   Lossless-quality means that no music quality is lost in this format.
   USB Audio

   USB audio is a digital audio connection used to send digital music from
   your computer to a digital to analogue converter (DAC). Usually
   computer manufacturers spend most of the overall budget on the
   processors and screen, leaving minimal budget for the built-in DAC and
   audio outputs.
   Volumetric Efficiency

   In electronics, volumetric efficiency quantifies the performance of
   some electronic function per unit volume, usually in as small a space
   as possible.
   ZEN

   Zen emphasizes rigorous self-control, meditation-practice, insight into
   the nature of things and the personal expression of this insight in
   daily life, especially for the benefit of others. Discover more here.

   And that will not do. So, the iEMatch2.5 is just like the original BUT
   it’s made for use with hi-res digital audio players, DAPs, sporting a
   2.5mm balanced output.

Sensitive soul

   Connect the iEMatch2.5 between them and your DAP for reduced background
   noise and hiss.

   Some headphones are more sensitive than others so the iEMatch2.5 has
   both High and Ultra sensitivity settings to boost your sound. Choose
   which best suits your headphone.

Bringing your Bits back

   It also provides a more open and transparent dynamic range and
   increases the usable volume range.

   This means you can increase the digital volume and get back the
   resolution you lose by listening at less than full volume.

   Rediscover the lost high-pitched note of the E-string or the low rumble
   of the bass drum.

Travelling companion

   Take the iEMatch2.5 with you.

   Pop the iEMatch2.5 into its handy velvet pouch with the included memory
   foam earplugs and aeroplane adapter and take it with you, wherever you
   go.

   The perfect travelling companion.

   The perfect gold-plated match!

   For those with dedicated hi-res digital audio players (DAPs) that offer
   a 2.5mm balanced output.

   Did you know you normally lose at least 2 Bits of resolution when
   listening to your favourite tracks? This is because you can’t listen at
   full volume.

   Using the iEMatch2.5 enables you to turn up the digital volume and get
   those 2 Bits back.

   Choose from ultra or high sensistivity to fine tune your tunes!

   Read our tech note to discover more.

   To hear everything from the high-pitched jingle of a tambourine to the
   deepest rumble of a kettledrum, you need a wide dynamic range.

   With great DACs, DAPs and headphones, the sound of EVERYTHING will be
   boosted, including the self-noise of the source AND the sound level.

   Plus some higher-end headphones and IEMs add to this by being sensitive
   themselves.

   To build a system around an expensive high-resolution headphone
   amplifier and then use it at a comfortable (not to mention safe)
   listening level means you have to turn the volume down to about 60% of
   its capacity. This will decrease both its dynamic range and audio
   quality.

   It’s like watching HD TV with some of the pixels from the screen
   missing.

   You lose around 2 Bits of resolution.

   This device ‘attenuates’ the volume and safely enables you to crank up
   the digital volume on your DAP without painful consequences! This
   translates into more music information being conveyed, the best dynamic
   range and your missing bits regained for the full high-resolution music
   experience!

   At the same time, it cuts out background noise, enhancing your
   listening enjoyment.

   It uses premium components from 6063-TS aluminium – magnesium alloy
   through to the signal transfer cable which is a 6N silver copper
   matrix.

   Add in the gold plated TRRS-Balanced connectors and there you have it –
   game, set and iEMatch.

iEMatch(Es): The Refinement Of Sound

   The iematch sound quality wise, provided a nice refinement with the
   added benefit of being a very good angle adaptor. The Iematch is very
   beautiful constructed with great materials and very beautiful. The
   meze cables have not any angle so they are really cumbersome when you
   connected them in the phone or my ipad so an adapter like this makes
   things so much easier. Actually, as my ipad can provide a lot of power
   to my Meze 99 I noticed a noticeable improvement in this scenario.
   Providing also a very useful angled version for this situation. So yes,
   iematch provides a very nice refinement to the sound in a simple
   scenario like this one.

Hiss-busting miracle worker in a magnesium suit

   I’ve been wanting to get an iEMatch ever since the first one was
   released. I was surprised that iFi didn’t send me one to review, given
   how much we’ve worked together. I’ve got a few hiss monster DAPs in
   house, including my favourite DAP, the QP2R. Beyond the QP2R, the
   HiFiMAN SuperMini and the HiFiMAN MegaMini are hiss cannons. When iFi
   sent me the press release for the 2.5mm version of iEMatch, I had to
   get it. So, when I saw them at Sound & Vision 2018 in Bristol, I bought
   one on the spot.

It works well and keeps the depth of sound where intended

   A great product. Nothing in the market rivals what this will do for
   your listening experience. If you are usin a balanced Headphone and a
   dac/amp or amp, this will take all of the hiss and crackle out of your
   sound. Amps have been known to add a hiss and crackle to your music. At
   the same time you are also gaining some volume and depth to the sound
   source. This is a problem that can be alleviated with the iematch 2.5.
   I’ve also use non-balanced version of this product, it too works well
   for what it is. They do not take anything out of your audio except for
   the hissing and cracking an amplifier will produce when amplifying your
   audio. I’d buy it again if I needed to but it seems this does the job
   very well. Using with CEntrance BlueDAC and a set of closed back
   Sennheiser 598 cs.
