   Good Bank
   Written by Credit risk analyst (Former Employee) from Paris, FR on
   January 22, 2017
   Good French Bank but it must turn more towards international business.
   Good environment (restaurant, sport gym, near the station).
   I invite to join this company.

   a little oppressive
   Written by Manutentionnaire (Former Employee) from Vitrolles (13) on
   August 20, 2018
   I didn't had a good experience at all. Work conditions were tough and
   bosses weren't really encouraging with the new workers, or even, nice
   at all. The co-workers were nice and there was at least a good mood
   between all manutentionnaires.

   We usually correct the production abnormally and bring the system back
   to work and the Operational maintenance team is a dynamic and enjoyable
   team and it was a good place to work.
