       ____________________

   This assignment ran from Nov 20 to Dec 11, 2017.

   Photographs have a special relationship with time. The very process of
   making an image involves time exposures of shorter or longer durations
   – and the end result is a moment of time. For this Your Shot assignment
   we want you to delve into describing the idea or concept of time. We
   are looking for images that encapsulate time, defining what a
   particular hour of the day looks like, tells a story about time, or
   captures a moment of time that clearly shows what life looks like at -
   say midnight, or 5:00AM, or noon. With clarity, coherence, and a point
   of view, show us a segment of life that defines a specific time, in the
   cycle of a 24-hour day.

   The goal of this assignment is to publish a final story, with a full 24
   hours in the life of our Your Shot community. What moment, scene, or
   activity tells us what a particular hour of the day look like? How do
   you frame it, what details are important to include?

   The published story will start with an image taken at midnight, and
   then show different hours throughout the day and world in our photo
   community. Like the assignments we do as photographers for National
   Geographic, our editors expect the end results to startle and surprise
   them – we are hoping for the same. Dazzle us with your creativity and
   the visualization of time.

   We want you to explore different landscapes and how they appear during
   the golden hour of sunset or during the early morning sunrise. Watch
   how the light shifts during different times of the day and explore new
   angles and perspectives to show us views we have not seen before. As
   you’re out capturing these moments remember to take note of the exact
   time the photo was taken as well as the location, and add this
   information to your caption.

   Deadline for submissions is Monday, December 11th at 12:00 pm EST.

   This assignment was inspired by our enhanced partnership with Rolex.
   The partnership promotes exploration and conservation. The
   organizations, with more than 200 years of combined experience
   supporting expeditions, are again joining forces to support pioneering
   explorers and nurture their successors in efforts to safeguard the
   Earth's oceans, poles and mountains for the benefit of future
   generations.

   For Rolex's support of this Assignment, National Geographic may provide
   images from the Assignment to the Sponsor, Rolex, for use on its
   website, social media platforms, and other outlets to promote and
   publicize the Assignment.

   Hello Your Shot!

   A fourth submission is being allowed for this assignment! Make it
   count! Try and think of a time when not many people might be
   photographing. Is it 3am? 4am? Or maybe 2:30pm!

Editor's Update #2

   Posted dec 6, 2017

   We want to thank everyone for such incredible and overwhelming
   contributions to the “Exploring Time” assignment. It’s great to see
   that you are taking so many different and interesting approaches to
   interpreting this theme. We wanted to share some thoughts about what we
   might be looking for in our final edit - as we head into the last few
   days of the assignment.

   Please think about what elements you include in your images that help
   convey a narrative about “time.” Is there some activity (or lack of
   human activity) in a particular place or landscape, which clearly
   conveys time - without relying on a clock in the frame of your
   photograph. Also, keep in mind the published story will explore a
   complete time cycle over a 24-hour period. If you look at what we have
   included in favorites so far, you may find some time slots in the day
   that do not yet have images selected - and that gives you an
   opportunity to go out and photograph something new. Hint - that’s
   probably NOT sunrise or sunset.

   What we would like to see you do, in these last few days, is go out
   with your camera – and think about “time.” Push yourselves to a new
   level, and make some truly amazing pictures. And don’t forget to
   include a note about the time when your image was made!

Editor's Update #1

   Posted nov 20, 2017

   Please make sure to include what time the image was taken and where the
   location was in your caption. One rule to consider, no watches can be
   in the frame, but we will allow clocks to be included as one of the
   elements in the photograph.
