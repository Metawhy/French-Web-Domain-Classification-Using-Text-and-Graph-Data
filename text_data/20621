Lightfields and brain stuff

   Magic Leap One’s unique design and technology lets in natural light
   waves together with softly layered synthetic lightfields. Both the real
   world and virtual light rays initiate neural signals that pass from the
   retina to the visual part of the brain, creating unbelievably
   believable experiences.

   Built for humans, not robots (sorry robots), Magic Leap One is inspired
   by human physiology. It makes the unreal feel real. And this is only
   the beginning.

   neon lights

Mix your reality with Lightwear

   Far more than a headset, Lightwear is a portal into worlds within our
   world. Its cameras, sensors, speakers and optical relay work together
   with the superpowered processor in the Lightpack to provide unique
   input to your visual system for unparalleled experiences. Retinas are
   the canvas, light is the medium, Magic Leap One is the brush.

   Computer Vision
          The sensor suite on Magic Leap One Lightwear makes digital
          objects contextually aware. So when you make digital penguins
          walk off the edge of the coffee table, they fall off the edge of
          the coffee table, just like real penguins would (no penguins
          were harmed in the making of Magic Leap One).

   Spatial Audio
          Spatial Audio naturally blends virtual objects with the real
          world by relaying distance and intensity with amazing accuracy
          and control. This means you won’t need to turn around to know
          how quickly a T-Rex is gaining on you.

   Prescription InsertNow Available!
          Magic Leap One can be equipped with a lens insert based on your
          personalized prescription for eyeglasses. So even without your
          glasses, you’ll still be able to see crystal clear experiences,
          crystal clearly. Learn more on

Superpowered Lightpack

   We’ve squeezed Magic Leap One’s awesome processing power into a small
   and portable Lightpack that clips right onto your pocket. Inside this
   engine is an integrated GPU and CPU that generates high-fidelity,
   gaming-quality graphics to create next-level experiences. And not being
   wired to a desktop means you can dodge the jellyfish after you’ve made
   your kitchen into a coral reef.

Mission Control

   Wield unworldly power with Magic Leap One’s Control. An engineering
   marvel, it doesn’t require any additional external sensors to deliver
   six degrees of freedom, also known as 6DoF. Use your Control as a paint

   Rocky Road at 14 scoops per second.

The Method in the Magic

   We created a new kind of computer so we built a whole new operating
   system. One that gets the most out of our spatial computing system by
   working in tandem with digital lightfields and the brain. Lumin OS is
   fully optimized for environment recognition, persistent digital content
   and the performance to power high-fidelity visual experiences that
   turns your wildest imagination into even wilder realities.
