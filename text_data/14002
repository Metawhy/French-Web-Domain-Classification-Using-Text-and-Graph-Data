About

   THE MICROBIOME
   Microbiome is the trillions of bacteria living in your gut, in your
   nose, on your skin and nearly everywhere else. These bugs are a
   life-long personal and natural protection against pathogens agression
   but evidence suggests, for example, that dysregulated gut microbiomes
   are strongly involved in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, Depression,
   Metabolic disorders and many other diseases.

   WHAT WE DO
   We are specialized in microbiome-related genomic data analysis and
   mechanistic, mathematical modeling and simulation of the microbiome to
   provide quantitative and predictive guidance to biotechnology and
   pharmaceutical companies. We bring our mathematical expertise, deep
   understanding of microbiome-related therapeutics and disease areas, and
   industry experience to your specific project. Most importantly, we are
   the first to bring a virtual microbiome to your desktop for
   personalized microbiome simulations using digital microbes.
