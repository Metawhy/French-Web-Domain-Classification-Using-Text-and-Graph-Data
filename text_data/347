Meditations

   In this series, Zilberberg creates animal montages as an expression of
   self-therapy. As a person living in the west, moving through a daily
   life that is sometimes high-pace and emotionally complex, the artist
   finds calm in the presence of these wild animals. The animals are
   placed in serene and ethereal scenes to focus on the beauty of the
   natural environment. In a world where many are constantly looking to
   the past or the future, these works aim to have a meditative affect on
   the viewer, promoting staying still to find happiness in the present
   moment.
