   After a perfect storm of elements combining candid childhood photos,
   Facebook and a generational dispute between family members led to the
   story of an alleged court case going viral, doubts have been raised by
   several investigators over the veracity of the original story.
   It seemed too good to be true. The story which appeared this week in
   one of Austria's largest circulation magazines seemed to be a real
   scoop.

   The timeless tale of an ungrateful child combined with privacy fears
   associated with universal access to the Internet meant a story with
   long legs -- but gradually, as reporters did their jobs, questions were
   raised.

   According to the German language Morgenpost, the editors of the
   Austrian weekly "Die ganze Woche" which first published the piece were
   short on details.

   The first question related to the identity of the young woman.  With
   strong personal privacy laws, the publication chose to change the name
   of the daughter to Anna Maier.  This is not unusual in itself, but it
   makes fact checking hard to achieve.

   The next issue was the lawyer cited in the initial report.  Michael
   Rami, who acknowledges his involvement in the report, denied that he
   represented the young woman directly, but instead was retained simply
   in an advisory role.

   There are other contradictions in the story, in particular relating to
   the involvement of the court.  If the young woman lives in Carinthia as
   claimed, then the relevant court would be in Klagenfurt -- but a check
   with that courthouse didn't show any known cases on the docket for
   November.

   A further concern is the secretive nature of the publishers involved
   with the paper.  According to Morgenpost, it's known internally as a
   "secret order", with its editor, Burkhard Trummer, insisting in an
   interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that "the story is
   true".

   Unfortunately, Trummer has been unable or unwilling to provide
   evidence, with journalists and the editorial team allegedly avoiding
   returning phone calls.

   Whatever the truths of the case, it's clear that awareness of the issue
   of the risks of sharing personal information in public is becoming more
   widespread.

   Perhaps that's the most important lesson to be drawn from this case,
   followed closely by the old adage of not believing everything you might
   read in a newspaper.

Woman sues parents for sharing embarrassing childhood photos

   A 18-year-old woman from Carinthia is suing her parents for posting
   photos of her on Facebook without her consent.

   She claims that since 2009 they have made her life a misery by
   constantly posting hundreds of photos of her, including embarrassing
   and intimate images from her childhood.

   Legal expert Michael Rami was quoted by Austrian media as saying he
   believes she has a good chance of winning in court.

   The shared images include baby pictures of her having her nappy changed
   and later potty training pictures.

   "They knew no shame and no limit - and didn’t care whether it was a
   picture of me sitting on the toilet or lying naked in my cot - every
   stage was photographed and then made public,” the 18-year-old said. The
   photos were shared on Facebook with her parents' 700 friends.

   Despite her requests, they have refused to delete the photos -
   prompting her to sue them. "I'm tired of not being taken seriously by
   my parents", she said. Her father believes that since he took the
   photos he has the right to publish the images.

   Rami says that if it can be proven that the images have violated her
   rights to a personal life, then her parents may lose the case. This is
   the first case of its kind in Austria, but he says that based on
   similar cases abroad the girl’s parents may have to pay some financial
   compensation for her pain and suffering, and will also be liable for
   her legal costs.

   The case will be heard in November - and if the parents lose this could
   have repercussions for Austrians who post countless images of their
   children on social media without their consent.

   Austrian privacy laws when it comes to social media are not as strict
   as some other countries - for example in France, anyone convicted of
   publishing and distributing images of another person without their
   consent can face up to one year in prison and a fine of up to €45,000.
   This would apply to parents publishing images of their children too.

   French authorities have warned parents against sharing photos of their
   children on Facebook, saying that the images could attract sexual
   predators and warn that children could face social and psychological
   problems later if intimate and embarrassing photos are shared with a
   wider public.

   Subsequently, some doubts have been expressed about the veracity of
   this story.

   A 18-year-old woman from Carinthia is suing her parents for posting
   photos of her on Facebook without her consent.

   She claims that since 2009 they have made her life a misery by
   constantly posting hundreds of photos of her, including embarrassing
   and intimate images from her childhood.

   Legal expert Michael Rami was quoted by Austrian media as saying he
   believes she has a good chance of winning in court.

   The shared images include baby pictures of her having her nappy changed
   and later potty training pictures.

   "They knew no shame and no limit - and didn’t care whether it was a
   picture of me sitting on the toilet or lying naked in my cot - every
   stage was photographed and then made public,” the 18-year-old said. The
   photos were shared on Facebook with her parents' 700 friends.

   Despite her requests, they have refused to delete the photos -
   prompting her to sue them. "I'm tired of not being taken seriously by
   my parents", she said. Her father believes that since he took the
   photos he has the right to publish the images.

   Rami says that if it can be proven that the images have violated her
   rights to a personal life, then her parents may lose the case. This is
   the first case of its kind in Austria, but he says that based on
   similar cases abroad the girl’s parents may have to pay some financial
   compensation for her pain and suffering, and will also be liable for
   her legal costs.

   The case will be heard in November - and if the parents lose this could
   have repercussions for Austrians who post countless images of their
   children on social media without their consent.

   Austrian privacy laws when it comes to social media are not as strict
   as some other countries - for example in France, anyone convicted of
   publishing and distributing images of another person without their
   consent can face up to one year in prison and a fine of up to €45,000.
   This would apply to parents publishing images of their children too.

   French authorities have warned parents against sharing photos of their
   children on Facebook, saying that the images could attract sexual
   predators and warn that children could face social and psychological
   problems later if intimate and embarrassing photos are shared with a
   wider public.

   Subsequently, some doubts have been expressed about the veracity of
   this story.
