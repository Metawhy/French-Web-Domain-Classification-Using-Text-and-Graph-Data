   Instagram post 2135105583477351247_374897883 See this knee right here?
   (No, not the pup, but isn’t she cute too?!) 🐶⁠ ⁠⠀ This knee went
   through surgery just a few weeks ago. (Full ACL reconstruction and
   medial meniscus repair to be exact!) But.. I didn’t tell you guys 😷⁠ ⁠⠀
   Why? I’m not really sure. Sometimes it’s easier to keep things to
   ourselves then share them with the world. I know I only would have
   received amazing words of encouragement but I didn’t want to seem like
   I was asking for that. 🤷🏻‍♀️⁠ ⁠⠀ I wanted to seem as though I always
   have my shit together and life is peachy on this side of the lens. 🍑⁠
   ⁠⠀ But it’s just not true. This knee injury has plagued me for over a
   year and while I am so happy that I’m finally “repaired” I still have a
   longgggg rehab journey ahead of me. 🏃🏻‍♀️⁠ ⁠⠀ So I’m writing this post
   for two reasons.⁠ ⁠⠀ 1. To be vulnerable. I talk about this all the
   time - instead of hiding your problems, weaknesses and setbacks, I
   encourage you to share them with your audience. You never know who has
   been through what you’re going through or who you could relate and
   connect with by simply sharing the truth. So hi 👋🏻 to anyone who’s had
   this surgery! Please comment below if you have any tips!⁠ ⁠⠀ 2. To
   remind you to utilize automation in your business - remember that free
   challenge I did? And that launch of The Instagram Ivy League that
   followed it? Well that was happening just a few days after under going
   surgery and was almost completely automated. Yep. I pre-planned
   everything I needed to ensure my business was taken care of while I was
   on the couch recovering, and you guys were still getting massive value
   from me!⁠ 🎁 ⁠⠀ Some things I used to make this seamless were:⁠ ⁠⠀
   @latermedia - for scheduling posts and instagram stories⁠⠀ @convertkit
   - for pre-writing and scheduling all emails⁠⠀ @facebook - for
   scheduling posts & videos within my facebook groups⁠  Without these
   simple things, I woulda been MIA for farrr too long.⁠ 🙈 ⁠⠀ So while I
   do advocate taking breaks from your business when you need it. I also
   highly encourage the use of automation to keep things running smoothly
   when you can’t.⁠ ⚙️ ⁠⠀ Do you use automation in your business? Let me
   know below! 👇🏻
   Instagram post 2125655333515760462_374897883 Leave me a 🙋🏻‍♀️emoji if
   you feel the following:⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ 👎🏻 The algorithm is so annoying and hard
   to keep up with⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ 👎🏻 You're tired of bot comments and the
   follow/unfollow strategy⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ 👎🏻 You're frustrated that your engagement
   is half of what it used to be⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ 👎🏻 No matter what you do, nothing
   seems to be working.⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ I get it. I was there once too. Trying to
   promote my social media management business and wondering, wait, why am
   I on this platform? It's seemingly a waste of time. 😤⁠ ⠀ Until I
   figured out it was the exact opposite. In fact, if I put less time into
   the app and more time into strategically creating content, I actually
   had waaaay better results. 📈⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ In just a few hours a week I was
   seeing a massive increase in followers (targeted & engaged ones!) and
   the inquires about my business sky-rocketed. 🚀 ⠀ With just a slight
   tweak in my strategy I went from a nobody, to somebody with significant
   recurring income. 💰⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ And believe me.. I'm just like you. I don't
   have any extra skills or resources to help me succeed on Instagram.
   🤷🏻‍♀️⁠ ⠀ Just a strategy that works. ✅⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ And now I'm sharing that
   exact, step by step strategy, to take your account from a time-waster
   to an actual business asset in my signature program, The Instagram Ivy

   Day 5!⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ Check your email for full details on what to post today 💌⁠⠀
   --⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ Let me guess.. you've got something to sell, but no one is
   buying??⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ Yep, seen it, heard it and been there before.⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ We're
   so lucky to live in a time where starting an online business is easier
   than ever before.. But we're also faced with so many question marks
   when it comes to how to promote our products, have it be seen by the
   right people, and actually generate recurring income 😓⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ We know we
   should be using Instagram but sooo many people spends hours and hours
   creating and publishing content that at the end of the day, amounts to
   nothing 🤷🏻‍♀️⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ That's why I created The Instagram Ivy League. It's
   my signature program that gives you an elite education in Instagram,
   marketing & making money with social media. 💪🏻⁠ ⠀ It teaches you not
   only how to build a targeted and loyal following, but how to convert
   those people in to actual paying customers (which is the ultimate goal,
   right?!) 💰⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ So if you're tired of trying to figure it out on your
   own and would prefer a step-by-step method that you can start
   implementing TODAY, then you need to click the link in my bio to check
   out the IG Ivy League and get your hands on a copy before the price
   increases! 👉🏻@instawithalex⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ Have any questions? Let me know below

   Day 3!⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ Check your email for full details on what to post today 💌⁠⠀
   --⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ Feeling confused or frustrated with Instagram? I hear ya.. but
   if doesn't have to be that way! Here's my top tips for crushing it on
   Instagram:⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ 1️⃣ Have a laser focused topic for your account (being
   too broad makes it hard to build a loyal following)⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ 2️⃣ Be
   authentic and transparent (Instagram is the most personal social
   platform - be yourself and you’ll attract your tribe)⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ 3️⃣ Provide
   value (want people to come back for more? make it worth their while!)⁠⠀
   ⁠⠀ 4️⃣ Always use a call to action (ask and yee shall receive!)⁠⠀ ⁠⠀
   5️⃣ Focus on link clicks, DMs & post saves/shares over follows & likes
   (these are worth more in the long run)⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ 6️⃣ Use hashtags (make sure
   they’re descriptive of your account/content)⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ 7️⃣ Post to your
   stories daily (easiest way to stay visible to your audience)⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ 8️⃣
   Engage with your target market regularly (want people to like and
   comment on your posts? You need to do the same!)⁠⠀ ⁠⠀ Have any to add
   to the list? Leave them below! 👇🏻

   Day 1!⠀ ⠀ Check your email for full details on what to post today 💌⁠
   Here’s my day 1 submission: ⠀ Hey everyone, I’m Alex Tooby! If you’ve
   been following me for a while I’m sure you’re shaking your head saying
   “duh!” but for those for you who are new, or maybe don’t know me that
   well, I want to share my story with you 📖⠀ ⠀ Just 5 years ago I was
   living in Calgary Alberta, working at a print shop, wondering what the
   heck I was going to do with my life 🤔⠀ ⠀ Ever since I was young I had
   attempted to make money online.. I had a blog with ads, I was an
   affiliate for brands and I even bought old things at garage sales and
   sold them on eBay 💸⠀ ⠀ I actually had a few successes along they way
   but none of my efforts really amounted to much in the long run 🤷🏻‍♀️⠀ ⠀
   Fast forward a few years, a couple ugly break ups and one
   cross-province move, I decided it was time to go all in on my skills
   (at this point I determined I was pretty good at social media and
   wanted to help others improve theirs!) 💪🏻⠀ ⠀ I started working
   one-on-one with a few clients but quickly realized my time was limited
   and I could only work with a few people, maxing out my potential
   earnings pretty quick 😴⠀ ⠀ At the same time I had started @menandcoffee
   and just a few months later was featured in Cosmopolitan magazine
   (among many other big publications!) 🤯⠀ ⠀ After that, I switched gears,
   launched my first course and you could say - the rest is history! 💨⠀ ⠀
   That launch catapulted me into an entirely different chapter of my
   life📚⠀ ⠀ I’m now a mentor to thousands of students, I get paid to
   travel and share my expertise, I live in the most beautiful place on
   earth (#squamishbc) and everyday I feel so grateful to wake up and do
   what I love 🙏🏻⠀ ⠀ If feels like it took forever to get here but there
   is so much more to come from me. If I’ve taught you how to rock your
   instagram well get buckled in because this next year will be focused on
   all the other elements of your business: how to create a website, build
   your list, utilize other social platforms, sell your products (or
   create one!) and so much more 🙌🏻⠀ ⠀ Thanks for following - I can’t wait
   for us to grow together 💜
