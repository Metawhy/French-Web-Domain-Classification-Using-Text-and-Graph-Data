   Over 75% of our people are researchers and developers, creating an
   environment more like a research-focused, technology firm than a
   finance company. Most of our researchers have scientific PhDs and,
   unusually, their backgrounds prior to joining us are almost exclusively
   academic. We have an inclusive and cosmopolitan outlook, so whilst our
   heritage is French, we have over 30 nationalities in our offices in
   Paris, London, New York, Tokyo and Sydney. This is reflected in our low
   turnover; once people join us they tend to stay and we are delighted to
   have been awarded the Great Place to Work accolade in 2017 and 2019. We
   think this is a function of working in a place with creativity and
   intellectual rigor not to mention the satisfaction of being involved in
   solving some of the most intellectually challenging problems in global
   financial markets.

   Collaboration is essential for us and is actively encouraged.
   Remuneration and structure are all designed to foster this
   collaborative spirit, not only because it makes for a productive
   working environment, but also because it encourages innovation, which
   is crucial in our business.

   We have retained our entrepreneurial spirit and, importantly, the
   ownership structure gives us the control and autonomy to make decisions
   collectively about how the firm is run and its future direction.

Trend Following: a persistent market anomaly

   1 May 2015

   Social sharing

   In this note we present a study of trend following using two centuries
   of data. We find that trend following is a persistent market anomaly
   with highly significant performance over this long back-test. We also
   present a combined portfolio of a trend following investment and a
   standard basket of equities and bonds. We conclude that trend following
   is a valuable contribution to any portfolio manager's toolbox.


    [This short note is a condensed version of our paper "Two centuries
    of trend following" published in the journal of Investment
    Strategies, 3, 41 - 61 (2014). Please refer to the long version for a
    more detailed discussion of the subject and an extensive bibliography
    of references.]
