Financial value of the global arms trade

   The SIPRI Arms Transfers Database was not developed to assess the
   financial value of the international arms trade. Rather, the Trend
   Indicator Value (TIV) data produced by the Database is designed to
   serve as an indicator of the volume of military equipment transferred
   in the world.

   The only means of making assessments of the financial value of the arms
   trade is to rely on official data provided by governments and industry
   bodies. There are significant limitations on using official national
   data in this way. There is no internationally agreed definition of what
   constitutes ‘arms’ and governments use different lists when collecting
   and reporting data on the financial value of their arms exports. In
   addition, there is no standardized methodology concerning how to
   collect and report such data, with some states reporting on export
   licences issued or used and other states using data collected from
   customs agencies.

Values of states' arms exports

   The files below present official data on the financial value of states'
   arms exports.

   The data is taken from reports by, direct quotes from or direct
   communication with governments or official industry bodies. The stated
   data coverage reflects the language used by the original source.
   National practices in this area vary, but the term ‘arms exports’
   generally refers to arms actually delivered; ‘arms export licences’
   generally refers to licences for arms exports issued by the national
   export licensing authority; and ‘arms export agreements’ refers to
   contracts or other agreements signed for arms exports. Sources refer to
   the five previous figures listed, beginning with the most recent.

   The first file presents all available national data on arms exports
   between 1994 and 2017. The data is presented in the relevant national
   currency in current values. Sources refer to the five previous figures
   listed, beginning with the most recent.
     * The financial value of national arms exports, 1994-2017


   The next two files present data on the financial value of countries'
   arms exports from 2001 to 2017 converted into US$. In the first file
   figures are in millions of US$ at current prices. Conversion to US$ is
   made using the market exchange rates of the reporting year. In the
   second file figures are in millions of US$ at constant (2017) prices.
   Conversion to constant (2017) US dollars is made using the market
   exchange rates of the reporting year and the US consumer price index
   (CPI).

   The countries included in the table are those that provide data on the
   financial value of ‘arms exports’, ‘arms export licences’ or ‘arms
   export agreements’ for a majority of the years covered and for which
   the average of the values given exceeds $10 million.
     * The financial value of national arms exports, 2001-2017, in current
       US$

     * The financial value of national arms exports, 2001-2017, in
       constant (2017) US$


Value of the global arms trade

   According to the SIPRI Arms Transfers Database, countries that produce
   official data on the financial value of their arms exports account for
   over 90 per cent of the total volume of deliveries of major weapons. It
   is possible therefore to use these figures to attain a rough estimate
   of the financial value of the global arms trade.

   However, using the data in this way is problematic. First, the data
   sets used are based on different definitions and methodologies and are
   not directly comparable. Second, several states (such as the United
   Kingdom) do not release data on arms exports but only on arms export
   licences, while other states (such as China) do not release any data on
   arms exports, licences, agreements or orders.

   Nonetheless, by adding up the data that states have made available on
   the financial value of their arms exports, as well as estimates for
   those that only provide data on arms export licences, agreements or
   orders, it is possible to estimate that the total value of the global
   arms trade in 2017 was at least $95 billion.* However, the true figure
   is likely to be higher.

   For more information, please contact the Arms transfers, production and
   military expenditure Programme.

   * When calculating this total, figures for arms exports were used where
   they are available. . In the case of Canada, the figure for arms
   exports in 2017 has been doubled, as the arms export figures for Canada
   exclude exports to the USA, which the Canadian authorities claim
   account for more than half of Canada’s exports of military technology.
   Where figures for arms exports in 2017 are not available but figures
   for 2016 are available, the 2016 figure has been used. Where figures
   for arms exports are not available in 2017 or 2016, figures for ‘arms
   export agreements’ or ‘arms export orders’ in 2016 have been used if
   available. Based on an analysis of past cases in which states have
   released data on both arms exports and arms export agreements or
   orders, the full figure for arms export agreements or orders has been
   used, but with a one-year lag. Where figures for arms export agreements
   or orders are not available, figures for ‘arms export licences’ in 2017
   have been used. Based on an analysis of reports by states that release
   data on both arms exports and arms export licences, half the figure for
   arms export licences, for the current year, has been used. This export
   licence-based estimate has also been used for Germany, even though it
   provides figures for arms exports. Germany’s arms export figures only
   include exports of ‘war weapons’, which is a much more limited category
   of goods and services than is generally covered by export licences.
   These figures therefore underestimate the total value of German arms
   exports.

Global arms industry: US companies dominate the Top 100; Russian arms
industry moves to second place

   10 December 2018

   (Stockholm, 10 December 2018) Sales of arms and military services by
   the world’s largest arms-producing and military services companies—the
   SIPRI Top 100—totalled $398.2 billion in 2017, according to new
   international arms industry data released today by the Stockholm
   International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).

   The total for the SIPRI Top 100 in 2017 is 2.5 per cent higher than in
   2016 and represents an increase of 44 per cent since 2002 (the first
   year for which comparable data is available; figures exclude China).
   This is the third consecutive year of growth in Top 100 arms sales.


US companies increase their share of total Top 100 arms sales

   With 42 companies listed in 2017, companies based in the United States
   continued to dominate the Top 100 in 2017. Taken together, the arms
   sales of US companies grew by 2.0 per cent in 2017, to $226.6 billion,
   which accounted for 57 per cent of total Top 100 arms sales. Five US
   companies were listed in the top 10 in 2017. ‘US companies directly
   benefit from the US Department of Defense’s ongoing demand for
   weapons,’ says Aude Fleurant, Director of SIPRI’s Arms and Military
   Expenditure Programme.

   Lockheed Martin remained the world’s largest arms producer in 2017,
   with arms sales of $44.9 billion. ‘The gap between Lockheed Martin and
   Boeing—the two largest arms producers in the world—increased from
   $11 billion in 2016 to $18 billion in 2017,’ says Fleurant.


Russia becomes the second largest arms producer in the Top 100

   The combined arms sales of Russian companies accounted for 9.5 per cent
   of the Top 100 total, making Russia the second largest arms producer in
   the Top 100 in 2017—a position that had been occupied by the United
   Kingdom since 2002. Taken together, the arms sales of the 10 Russian
   companies listed in the Top 100 increased by 8.5 per cent in 2017, to
   $37.7 billion. ‘Russian companies have experienced significant growth
   in their arms sales since 2011,’ says Siemon Wezeman, Senior Researcher
   with SIPRI’s Arms and Military Expenditure Programme. ‘This is in line
   with Russia’s increased spending on arms procurement to modernize its
   armed forces.’

   In 2017 a Russian company appeared in the top 10 for the first time
   since SIPRI started publishing its annual Top 100 list. ‘Almaz-Antey,
   which was already Russia’s largest arms-producing company, increased
   its arms sales by 17 per cent in 2017, to $8.6 billion,’ says Alexandra
   Kuimova, Research Assistant with SIPRI’s Arms and Military Expenditure
   Programme.

   Along with Almaz-Antey, three other Russian companies in the Top 100
   increased their arms sales by more than 15 per cent: United Engine
   Corporation (25 per cent), High Precision Systems (22 per cent) and
   Tactical Missiles Corporation (19 per cent).


The UK remains the largest arms producer in Western Europe

   The combined arms sales of the 24 companies in Western Europe listed in
   the Top 100 increased by 3.8 per cent in 2017, to $94.9 billion, which
   accounted for 23.8 per cent of the Top 100 total. The UK remained the
   largest arms producer in the region in 2017, with total arms sales of
   $35.7 billion and seven companies listed in the Top 100. ‘The combined
   arms sales of British companies were 2.3 per cent higher than in 2016,’
   says Fleurant. ‘This was largely due to increases in the arms sales of
   BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce and GKN.’

   BAE Systems, which is ranked fourth in the Top 100, is the UK’s biggest
   arms producer. Its arms sales rose by 3.3 per cent in 2017, to
   $22.9 billion.


Other notable developments

     * The arms sales of Turkish companies rose by 24 per cent in 2017.
       ‘This significant increase reflects Turkey’s ambitions to develop
       its arms industry to fulfil its growing demand for weapons and
       become less dependent on foreign suppliers,’ says Pieter Wezeman,
       Senior Researcher with SIPRI’s Arms and Military Expenditure
       Programme.
     * Taken together, the arms sales of the four Indian companies ranked
       in the Top 100 totalled $7.5 billion in 2017, representing a 1.9
       per cent share of Top 100 arms sales.
     * Sales of the top 15 manufacturing companies listed in the Fortune
       Global 500 totalled $2311 billion in 2017. This is almost 10 times
       greater than the total arms sales of the top 15 arms producers
       ($231.6 billion) in 2017, and almost six times greater than the
       total combined arms sales of the Top 100 ($398.2 billion).


The SIPRI Arms Industry Database

   The SIPRI Arms Industry Database was created in 1989. At that time it
   excluded data for companies in countries in Eastern Europe, including
   the Soviet Union. However, the current version contains data from 2002,
   including data for companies in Russia. Chinese companies are not
   included in the database due to the lack of available data on which to
   make a reasonable or consistent estimate of arms sales dating back to
   2002.

   ‘Arms sales’ are defined as sales of military goods and services to
   military customers domestically and abroad. Unless otherwise specified,
   all changes are expressed in real terms. All changes between 2016 and
   2017 are based on the list of companies ranked in 2017 (i.e. the annual
   comparison is between the same set of companies).

   The SIPRI Arms Industry Database, which presents a more detailed data
   set for the years 2002–17, is available on the SIPRI website.


   This is the first of three major data launches in the lead-up to the
   publication of the 2019 edition of the SIPRI Yearbook. In the first
   half of 2019, SIPRI will release its international arms transfers data
   (details of all international transfers of major weapons in 2018) as
   well as its world military expenditure data (comprehensive information
   on global, regional and national trends in military spending). All data
   will feature in SIPRI Yearbook 2019, SIPRI’s flagship publication,
   which will be published in mid-2019.

Global arms trade: USA increases dominance; arms flows to the Middle East
surge, says SIPRI

   11 March 2019
   Global arms trade: USA increases dominance; arms flows to the Middle
   East surge, says SIPRI
   The trend in international transfers of major weapons, 1979—2018. Data
   and graphic: SIPRI

   (Stockholm, 11 March 2019) The volume of international transfers of
   major arms in 2014–18 was 7.8 per cent higher than in 2009–13 and
   23 per cent higher than in 2004–2008, according to new data on arms
   transfers published today by the Stockholm International Peace Research
   Institute (SIPRI).

   The ﬁve largest exporters in 2014–18 were the United States, Russia,
   France, Germany and China. Together, they accounted for 75 per cent of
   the total volume of arms exports in 2014–18. The flow of arms increased
   to the Middle East between 2009–13 and 2014–18, while there was a
   decrease in flows to all other regions.


The gap between the USA and other arms exporters widens

   US arms exports grew by 29 per cent between 2009–13 and 2014–18, and
   the US share of total global exports rose from 30 per cent to 36 per
   cent. The gap between the top two arms-exporting states also increased:
   US exports of major arms were 75 per cent higher than Russia’s in
   2014–18, while they were only 12 per cent higher in 2009–13. More than
   half (52 per cent) of US arms exports went to the Middle East in
   2014–18.

   ‘The USA has further solidified its position as the world’s leading
   arms supplier,’ says Dr Aude Fleurant, Director of the SIPRI Arms and
   Military Expenditure Programme. ‘The USA exported arms to at least 98
   countries in the past five years; these deliveries often included
   advanced weapons such as combat aircraft, short-range cruise and
   ballistic missiles, and large numbers of guided bombs.’

   Arms exports by Russia decreased by 17 per cent between 2009–13 and
   2014–18, in particular due to the reduction in arms imports by India
   and Venezuela. Between 2009–13 and 2014–18 France increased its arms
   exports by 43 per cent and Germany by 13 per cent. The combined arms
   exports of European Union member states accounted for 27 per cent of
   global arms exports in 2014–18.

   A small number of countries outside Europe and North America are large
   arms exporters. China was the fifth largest arms exporter in 2014–18.
   Whereas Chinese arms exports rose by 195 per cent between 2004–2008 and
   2009–13, they increased by only 2.7 per cent between 2009–13 and
   2014–18. Israeli, South Korean and Turkish arms exports increased
   substantially—60 per cent, 94 per cent and 170 per cent,
   respectively—between 2009–13 and 2014–18.


Middle Eastern arms imports almost double in the past five years

   Arms imports by states in the Middle East increased by 87 per cent
   between 2009–13 and 2014–18 and accounted for 35 per cent of global
   arms imports in 2014–18. Saudi Arabia became the world’s largest arms
   importer in 2014–18, with an increase of 192 per cent compared with
   2009–13. Arms imports by Egypt, the third largest arms importer in
   2014–18, tripled (206 per cent) between 2009–13 and
   2014–18. Arms imports by Israel (354 per cent), Qatar (225 per cent)
   and Iraq (139 per cent) also rose between 2009–13 and 2014–18. However,
   Syria’s arms imports fell by 87 per cent.

   ‘Weapons from the USA, the United Kingdom and France are in high demand
   in the Gulf region, where conflicts and tensions are rife,’ says Pieter
   D. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms and Military
   Expenditure Programme. ‘Russia, France and Germany dramatically
   increased their arms sales to Egypt in the past five years.’


Asia and Oceania remains the largest importer region

   States in Asia and Oceania received 40 per cent of global arms imports
   in 2014–18, but there was a decrease of 6.7 per cent compared with
   2009–13. The top five arms importers in the region were India,
   Australia, China, South Korea and Viet Nam.

   Australia became the world’s fourth largest arms importer in 2014–18
   after its arms imports increased by 37 per cent compared with 2009–13.
   Indian arms imports decreased by 24 per cent between
   2009–13 and 2014–18. Russia accounted for 58 per cent of India’s arms
   imports in 2014–18. Chinese arms imports decreased, but it was still
   the world’s sixth largest arms importer in 2014–18.

   ‘India has ordered a large number of major arms from foreign suppliers;
   however, deliveries are severely delayed in many cases,’ says Siemon T.
   Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms and Military Expenditure
   Programme. ‘In contrast, Chinese arms imports decreased because China
   has been more successful in designing and producing its own modern
   weaponry.’


Other notable developments:

     * Between 2009–13 and 2014–18 arms imports decreased by states in the
       Americas (–36 per cent), in Europe (–13 per cent), and in Africa
       (–6.5 per cent).
     * Algeria accounted for 56 per cent of African imports of major arms
       in 2014–18. Most other states in Africa import very few major arms.
     * The top five arms importers in sub-Saharan Africa were Nigeria,
       Angola, Sudan, Cameroon and Senegal. Together, they accounted for
       56 per cent of arms imports to the subregion.
     * Between 2009–13 and 2014–18 British arms exports increased by 5.9
       per cent. In 2014–18 a total of 59 per cent of British arms exports
       went to the Middle East, the vast bulk of which was made up of
       deliveries of combat aircraft to Saudi Arabia and Oman.
     * Venezuelan arms imports fell by 83 per cent between 2009–13 and
       2014–18.
     * China delivered major arms to 53 countries in 2014–18, compared
       with 41 in 2009–13 and 32 in 2004–2008. Pakistan was the main
       recipient (37 per cent) in 2014–18, as it has been for all
       five-year periods since 1991.


For editors

   The SIPRI Arms Transfers Database contains information on all
   international transfers of major arms (including sales, gifts and
   production licences) to states, international organizations and armed
   non-state groups from 1950 to the most recent full calendar year, 2018.
   SIPRI data reflects the volume of deliveries of arms, not the financial
   value of the deals. As the volume of deliveries can ﬂuctuate
   signiﬁcantly year-on-year, SIPRI presents data for five-year periods,
   giving a more stable measure of trends.

Asia and the Middle East lead rising trend in arms imports, US exports grow
significantly, says SIPRI

   12 March 2018
   Asia and the Middle East lead rising trend in arms imports, US exports
   grow significantly, says SIPRI
   The trend in international transfers of major weapons, 1978—2017. Data
   and graphic: SIPRI

   Continuing the upward trend that began in the early 2000s, the volume
   of international transfers of major weapons in 2013-17 was 10 per cent
   higher than in 2008-12, according to new data on arms transfers
   published today by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
   (SIPRI).

   The flow of arms increased to Asia and Oceania and the Middle East
   between 2008–12 and 2013–17, while there was a decrease in the flow to
   Africa, the Americas and Europe. The five biggest exporters—the United
   States, Russia, France, Germany and China—together accounted for 74 per
   cent of all arms exports in 2013–17.

   'The increased flow of arms raises concerns over their impact on
   international peace and security', says Ambassador Jan Eliasson, Chair
   of the SIPRI Governing Board. 'It stresses the need to improve and
   implement international mechanisms such as the Arms Trade Treaty.'


Arms exporters: The USA extends its lead

   In 2013–17 the USA accounted for 34 per cent of total arms exports. Its
   arms exports increased by 25 per cent between 2008–12 and 2013–17. US
   arms exports in 2013–17 were 58 per cent higher than those of
   Russia—the second largest arms exporter in that period. The USA
   supplied major arms to 98 states in 2013–17. Exports to states in the
   Middle East accounted for 49 per cent of total US arms exports in that
   period.

   ‘Based on deals signed during the Obama administration, US arms
   deliveries in 2013–17 reached their highest level since the late
   1990s,’ said Dr Aude Fleurant, Director of the SIPRI Arms and Military
   Expenditure Programme. ‘These deals and further major contracts signed
   in 2017 will ensure that the USA remains the largest arms exporter in
   the coming years.’

   Arms exports by Russia decreased by 7.1 per cent between 2008–12 and
   2013–17. France increased its arms exports by 27 per cent between the
   two periods and was the third largest arms exporter in 2013–17. Arms
   exports by Germany—the fourth largest exporter in 2013–17—fell by 14
   per cent between 2008–12 and 2013–17. However, German arms exports to
   the Middle East increased by 109 per cent.

   Few countries outside North America and Europe are large exporters of
   arms. China was the fifth largest arms exporter in 2013–17. Its arms
   exports rose by 38 per cent between 2008–12 and 2013–17. While Pakistan
   was the main recipient of China’s arms exports in 2013–17, there were
   large increases in Chinese arms exports to Algeria and Bangladesh in
   that period. Israel (55 per cent), South Korea (65 per cent) and Turkey
   (145 per cent) substantially increased their respective arms exports
   between 2008–12 and 2013–17.


The Middle East: Arms imports have doubled over the past 10 years

   Most states in the Middle East were directly involved in violent
   conflict in 2013–17. Arms imports by states in the region increased by
   103 per cent between 2008–12 and 2013–17, and accounted for 32 per cent
   of global arms imports in 2013–17.

   ‘Widespread violent conflict in the Middle East and concerns about
   human rights have led to political debate in Western Europe and North
   America about restricting arms sales,’ said Pieter Wezeman, Senior
   Researcher with the SIPRI Arms and Military Expenditure Programme. ‘Yet
   the USA and European states remain the main arms exporters to the
   region and supplied over 98 per cent of weapons imported by Saudi
   Arabia.’

   In 2013–17 Saudi Arabia was the world’s second largest arms importer,
   with arms imports increasing by 225 per cent compared with 2008–12.
   Arms imports by Egypt—the third largest importer in 2013–17—grew by 215
   per cent between 2008–12 and 2013–17. The United Arab Emirates was the
   fourth largest importer in 2013–17, while Qatar (the 20th largest arms
   importer) increased its arms imports and signed several major deals in
   that period.


South Asia: Regional tensions drive India’s growing arms imports

   India was the world’s largest importer of major arms in 2013–17 and
   accounted for 12 per cent of the global total. Its imports increased by
   24 per cent between 2008–12 and 2013–17. Russia accounted for
   62 per cent of India’s arms imports in 2013–17. However, arms imports
   from the USA rose by 557 per cent between 2008–12 and 2013–17, making
   it India’s second largest arms supplier. Despite its continuing
   tensions with India and ongoing internal conflicts, Pakistan’s arms
   imports decreased by 36 per cent between 2008–12 and 2013–17. Pakistan
   accounted for 2.8 per cent of global arms imports in 2013–17. Its arms
   imports from the USA dropped by 76 per cent in 2013–17 compared with
   2008–12.

   ‘The tensions between India, on the one side, and Pakistan and China,
   on the other, are fuelling India’s growing demand for major weapons,
   which it remains unable to produce itself,’ said Siemon Wezeman, Senior
   Researcher with the SIPRI Arms and Military Expenditure Programme.
   ‘China, by contrast, is becoming increasingly capable of producing its
   own weapons and continues to strengthen its relations with Pakistan,
   Bangladesh and Myanmar through arms supplies.’

   China’s arms imports fell by 19 per cent between 2008–12 and 2013–17.
   Despite this decrease, it was the world’s fifth largest arms importer
   in 2013–17.


Other notable developments

     * Arms imports by African states decreased by 22 per cent between
       2008–12 and 2013–17.
     * Algeria accounted for 52 per cent of all African imports in
       2013–17.
     * Nigeria’s arms imports grew by 42 per cent between 2008–12 and
       2013–17.
     * Total arms imports by states in the Americas decreased by 29 per
       cent in 2013–17 compared with 2008–12. Venezuela’s arms imports
       fell by 40 per cent between the two periods.
     * Imports by states in Europe decreased by 22 per cent between
       2008–12 and 2013–17. Deliveries of advanced combat aircraft from
       the USA will drive import volumes up during the next few years.
     * In 2013–17 China accounted for 68 per cent of arms imports by
       Myanmar, followed by Russia (15 per cent).
     * Indonesia increased its arms imports by 193 per cent between
       2008–12 and 2013–17.
     * Australia was the sixth largest arms importer globally in 2013–17.
