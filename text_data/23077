Lately… Weeks of June 8 & 15

   cobble hill - June 24, 2014

   When a friend needs some cheering up, the thing to do is go out for a
   lovely lunch. It certainly does not cure all that ails, but it sure
   does take her mind off things for a while. How can it not when it’s at
   The Dutch and when it ends with this….

   photo(27)   photo(28)

   If you are a product of the 80’s, you’ll appreciate that a couple of
   the girls and I headed out to Jones Beach to see The Steve Miller Band
   and Journey. As tempting as it was to Aqua Net the heck out of our hair
   and wear feather earrings, we kept it pretty low key. That is, until
   they played “Don’t Stop Believin’”. How could we help ourselves? I
   still have a sore throat from that evening.

   A couple of weeks of my favorite things would never be complete without
   some oysters. Maison Premiere gets it right with a capital “R”. Aside
   from décor and staff that makes you feel as though you’ve just stepped
   into a Toulouse Lautrec painting, their oyster list is as long as my
   arm. Ninigret Cup oysters? They’re on there. Blackbear Points? Yup. As
   well as a host of other obscure varieties.

   photo(29)    photo(30)

   Mollusk Madness was followed by dinner at The Elm. Chef Paul Liebrandt
   is masterful at combining interesting flavors and textures. Ocean trout
   with burratta followed by salt cod with gnochetti and broccoli rabe. I
   was skeptical too but sometimes you  need to put your meal in the
   chef’s hands.  Skilled chefs rarely disappoint.

   photo(31)   photo(36)

   Dessert was no exception. The Gold Bar (ganache, huckleberry, red fruit
   sorbet) and Japanese Cheesecake (coconut, pineapple, lime).

   photo(32)    photo(35)

   The week wrapped up with farmer’s markets, Pier 25 playground in
   Tribeca, some outdoor music and brunch at Locanda Verde.  That is a
   week ended well.

Lately…. Weeks of May 25th and June 1st

   cobble hill - June 10, 2014

   These past two weeks have centered largely around Nate. He has a lot
   going on in his life…at least for a little kid. Not only did he turn
   five, but he also graduated from preschool. On the same day.   These
   events involve parties and celebrations of all sorts. Plus an effort to
   wrap his five year old mind around it all. I won’t even mention trying
   to wrap my own adult brain around it all. Suffice it to say there have
   been a lot of emotions (ok, tears) whirling around our house. Though
   these milestones are bittersweet, they are happy ones and we are
   grateful to be able to celebrate them.

   party1   party2

   For his party, Nate really wanted a Star Wars theme. In a bouncy castle
   place, to boot. Try as I might to change his mind, Nate wasn’t having
   it. I should mention that I know nothing, whatsoever, about Star Wars.
   Until I was 18 I thought that Princess Leia was nothing more than a
   girl’s hairstyle.  Etsy saved the day.  I was able to find some
   chocolate dipped pretzel light sabers (HitstheSpot), those awesome
   masks and other paper elements (PimpYourParty) and some adorable pins
   for the goody bags (BurritoPrincess). These sorts of things come in
   very handy when all you have to work with is red and purple decor and
   fluorescent lights.

   In the end, everyone had a blast. Perhaps the adults most of all.

   nate cupcake   IMG_5940(2)

   His school celebration was very sweet. It made me remember what a big
   deal it was to bring cupcakes in for your whole class.  Not to mention
   having your mom come in and read a super cute book about crayons going
   on strike (The Day the Crayons Quit by Drew Daywalt)

   eggs`1   eggs2

   We wrapped up “Nate’s Week” with a super sweet graduation celebration.
   Since I can barely talk about him moving on to kindergarten without
   tearing up, it is doubtful that I can string together some sentences to
   describe the occasion. Instead, I’ll focus on the fact that my
   contribution to the Potluck Graduation Dinner was deviled eggs.
   Preparing them was a “Like Water for Chocolate” moment for me, but
   they are a crowd pleaser. And usually don’t reduce me to tears.

   This has me in the mood to cook all the day long:

   photo(8)    photo(9)

   So, this past week, I made some homemade ricotta gnocchi with
   asparagus, peas and morels. Just seemed like the right thing to do this
   time of year.

   photo(11)   photo(12)

   The flavors are so reminiscent of spring, plus it was so quick and easy
   that it allowed me to enjoy the lovely weather and some time with these
   two:

   photo(14)   photo(15)

   I also concocted this funny, but delicious, little breakfast. I kind of
   just pulled a bunch of odds and ends out of the refrigerator and
   “voila”, ended up with a bowl of rice with scallions, spinach, and
   kimchi topped with an over easy egg. If, like me,  you struggle to find
   a simple savory breakfast, look no further.

   photo(13)

   And, to top it off, I got to work on a photo shoot for work, which is
   one of my favorite things to do. Rebecca and I decided it was time for
   a new promo card to showcase our lovely “Joyful Cakes”, dessert tables
   and event favor boxes. So, we came up with the palette, overall
   aesthetic, sweets assortment and all of the other details and spent
   half the day photographing all of our pastry chef, Ayumi’s, lovely
   work. I would say my job is not a bad one.

Meet Our Vendors: Khara Ledonne

   cobble hill - May 21, 2014

   _MG_9929

   People pay Khara Ledonne to write on their walls. And sometimes -
   sometimes - she gets paid in cookies.

   Khara recently revisited our Dean Street shop to add something special
   to the family tree mural she painted here about 7 years ago... the name
   of Dawn and Dave's 4 month old daughter, Camille. Her mural design is
   executed with a feathery hand, concentric circles of family generations
   garlanded with a hazelnut toned paint that reads like antique ink on
   parchment. Sitting in the cafe on a spring or summer day can feel like
   you've been swept away before a fresco in a hidden Sicilian church.

   Working out of her Greenpoint studio, Khara has created murals at our
   neighbors Stinky Brooklyn and Jolie Cantina, both just down the street
   on Smith, and at best kept secret wine bar Flying Lobster in Red Hook,
   among many other venues found not just around Brooklyn, but around the
   world. Back in NYC, she first met Dawn after capturing Spain in paint
   at wine shop Tinto Fino on the Lower East Side. The wonderful paradox
   is that Khara the full scale muralist has a thriving shop on Etsy -
   creating miniature painted lockets.

   _MG_9977

   “I like the feel of the space, it’s so calm,” she says, letting a cup
   of Majorelle Mint tea steep in front of her, a selection of brushes and
   paint temporarily transforming our cafe into her personal studio.  She
   works hypnotically, tracing existing letters she has already painted
   into the mural to be sure the hand matches when she letters Camille’s
   name. Working in public is a part of the process she incorporates,
   tracing and then painting with delicacy as customers settle into tables
   to watch.

   _MG_9971   _MG_9888

   Under normal circumstances, Khara does not need to negotiate the rate
   for her commissions. But today is a little special. “You don’t
   understand, if you paid me, I’d just spend it all on cookies!” ...So,
   cookies it is! A boxful of lemon bars serve as a bonus.

   Finishing the “e” in Camille, she steps back. “It’s more feminine” she
   says, and she’s right, the “e” in Nate’s name has crisper edges while
   Camille’s is ever so slightly rounder.  She adds a lilting coil to the
   “C” and is done.  Camille has officially joined the One Girl Cookie
   family.

   _MG_9841   _MG_9992

   To see the mural, drop into our 68 Dean Street shop in Cobble Hill, and
   to keep up with Khara, please check out her site at

   I can’t complain when my week is bookended by celebrations for people I
   adore. My nephew Jonah’s 4^th birthday party was on Sunday. Always a
   fun time at my sister and brother-in-law’s place..especially if Jonah
   is performing for everyone. He’s quite a character, that kid.

   Seeing some very dear friends visiting from Boston was a treat followed
   by a girl’s night out with a few other dear friends. This group is a
   bunch of foodies who know a lot about food and wine..they are “in the
   business,” if you know what I mean.  So, to say that we were all
   thoroughly impressed with our experience at The Gander is no small
   feat. It’s not surprising as Recette, Chef Jesse Schenker’s other
   place, is one of my favorite restaurants. This place is a completely
   different, but an equally satisfying, experience. Dishes like sea trout
   tartare and halibut with morels, artichokes and caviar are not
   upstaged, but certainly share the stage with a killer dessert menu.
   They had me at banana parfait with saffron, caramel and coconut. But
   why would we stop there? We went for the whole shebang.

   A visit to the kitchen by Nate’s pre-k class got us over the midweek
   hump. Kids this age are just so curious and inquisitive. And cute too.
   This is Nate with a best buddy.

   In the world of plants and trees, there was a lot of change. Those
   cherry blossoms that we had been waiting so patiently for gave us only
   a brief rendezvous. And just to rub it in, they blanketed our sidewalks
   with about a kabillion petals. The natural pink shag carpet was so
   lovely (just ask one of the many people who stopped to take photos).

   The “farm” has transformed into a whole new place. We even had our
   first harvest… baby mustard greens and spinach. Has me pretty excited
   for the bounty to come

   And just when I thought my week couldn’t get any better, it ended with
   a surprise 45^th Anniversary party for my parents. Attended by their
   nearest and dearest friends. We hosted it at our house and a great time
   was had by all. It was a celebratory night replete with fake mustache
   selfies and couples cake cutting!

Dessert Trends

   cobble hill - May 9, 2014

Currently Trending: Breakfast for Dessert

   photo 1   photo 2

   Ok, so this isn't exactly anything new. Thomas Keller has been serving
   donuts and coffee since The French Laundry first opened. Allegedly,
   according to The New York Times, it all started in Los Angeles in 1991
   with an out of work Keller. And really, who doesn't have a fond memory
   of eating warm, sugary donuts right out of a paper bag? It's such a
   simple treat and yet it has the power to make even the most seasoned
   diner giddy with excitement. Breakfast foods seem to bring back
   childhood memories and make us all nostalgic for an easier time.

   These days when many desserts can leave us confused and unsatisfied,
   breakfast is an easy way to keep diners pleased and content. Breakfast
   is also a great way to keep flavors familiar while textures and the
   overall presentation might be unfamiliar. Case in point: dinner at Per
   Se. Pastry Chefs also seem to be able to make something as simple as
   French toast sound fancy ("caramelized brioche").

   I think breakfast for dessert has become a trend because of a general
   feeling of nostalgia in New York City. Time is moving quickly and
   everything is changing so quickly around us; it's nice to slow down and
   eat a bowl of cereal after a busy day. At One Girl, we've noticed a
   trend where brides request s'mores-flavored wedding cakes and dessert
   bars that include things like oreos, snickerdoodles, and snowball
   cupcakes. We all love nostalgia and breakfast is the easiest way to
   remember a time when you were sitting at the kitchen table in your
   pajamas and mom was making you eggs and bacon.

   1. Betony: amaranth, maple, and caramelized banana

   2. Momofuku: cereal milk panna cotta with caramelized corn flakes

   3. Shake Shack, the LumberShack: vanilla custard, maple bacon brittle
   and peanuts

   4. Alder: vanilla milk custard, cinnamon cereal, candied almonds,
   apple, coffee

   Not pictured but seriously addicting: The Dutch Brooklyn Blackout
   Donuts.

Lately… Week Of April 27, 2014

   cobble hill - May 6, 2014

   This past week, it was all about trees, blossoms and all manner of
   things growing from the ground (literally, and not so literal). For
   instance, additions to our hand-painted family tree at the Dean St
   shop,

   photo   khara mural

   and our ever changing cherry trees which are now at their fluffy peak.

   Mother Nature is really pulling out all the stops. There is no better
   proof of that than the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens which we visited this
   past Saturday while Dave’s parents were in town. It was packed with
   people, but also with also sorts of lovely blossoming trees.

   bbg1    bbg2

   Our little “urban farm” is coming right along. Dave and I are already
   talking about what kinds of dishes we will whip up with this year’s
   crop, what veggies will get pickled and what to do with the
   overabundance of mint and thyme.

   garden1    garden2

   And last, but not least, a highlight of the week, having nothing to do
   with vegetation, we had our Annual OGC bowling outing. It was our
   second at Melody Lanes in Sunset Park, which is so terrific because it
   makes you feel like you hopped in a time machine and traveled back in
   time. Everything just pushes the boundaries of being overly outdated
   but the bowling is great and the company even better. Who can argue
   with this:

   dumbobowl   bowling

   dawndavebowl   bowling1

   Dave and I feel pretty lucky to work with such a special group of
   people. And that sentiment has nothing to do with their impressive
   bowling skills.

I Love Lists: Spring Ingredients

   cobble hill - May 1, 2014

   photo (96)

   It's time! You can ditch those overused recipes with citrus, beets, and
   winter squash. It is spring! I don't think any of us at One Girl
   Cookies have been shy about sharing our excitement over this
   welcomed-season. I wanted to take this time to share some of the
   produce I'm looking forward to finding at my farmer's market this
   month. Not many people were eager for April showers. Instead, April
   showers meant additional cold, cloudy days and more indoor activities.
   However, to me April showers are truly a great thing; April showers
   mean spring and summer produce are receiving the healthy hydration they
   need. Here's to a few more spring showers so that we're able to enjoy
   the following items for a long, delicious spring season.

   The List:

   iStock_000005895217Small    iStock_000004422640_Small
   iStock_000007930280Medium
    1. Rhubarb: Rhubarb and strawberry are no longer a
       surprise-combination; we are all aware of the winning duo. However,
       rhubarb on its own demonstrates an award-winning dessert that won’t
       over-power you with sweetness. When cooked, rhubarb has the right
       texture and flavor profile to work perfectly with some biscuits
       (aka cobbler) on top. And as Deb says, this is a delightful
       addition to Mother’s Day brunch.  Test it out.

    1. Spring onions:  Before transporting myself over to the restaurant
       world, I would never in a million years felt excited over onions.
       But now I do. Spring onions have the right flavor and aroma to pair
       alongside any main course you may be cooking. Test it out.
    2. Fava beans : Let’s be honest: these are not pleasant to prepare. I
       avoided favas for a long time until I found it could be quite
       therapeutic peeling these guys. Throw on the news, your favorite
       talk show, or even the Frozen soundtrack and just savor the time
       you’re spending to prepare your dinner. Reflect, relax, and don’t
       let the tediousness get to you. Test it out.
    3. Cherries:  I could never have a list without cherries; they’re
       tart, sweet, and just scream of warm weather. I don’t mind pitting
       these either, just make sure you’re not wearing any white clothing.
       Cherry pie is possibly my favorite dessert on this earth to eat.
       This recipe will win you over. Test it out.
    4. Strawberries: I know what you’re thinking when you see the
       following recipe: Pickled strawberries? You’re crazy, One Girl!
       These will blow your mind. I love pickling the last of the season
       strawberries as a way to hold onto the berry season a little bit
       longer. However, this is also perfect when you have the
       first-of-the-season berries that are still a bit tart. Pickled
       strawberries are an excellent addition to a cheese plate, salad, or
       even a dessert. I prefer them as a mid-afternoon snack while
       contemplating dinner. No matter what, you’ll become addicted to
       these tart and zesty treats. Test it out.
    5. Best for last: Ramps: For those of you who are fortunate enough to
       be familiar with this tantalizing vegetable, you are aware of their
       short season. Ramps are available between March and April and it
       seems mania unravels at the start of their season. The majority of
       ramps harvested each year are actually foraged within the Eastern
       United States and Canada. Ramps are almost scallion-esque and will
       leave you with a stinky-breath. Chef’s marvel at their ability to
       be both an aromatic and cooking green. Test it out.

Lately…week of April 20th

   cobble hill - April 29, 2014

   Having a five year old around has really changed Easter morning in our
   house. I hadn’t partaken in an egg hunt in many years but I have to
   say, it was so much fun to watch Nate scurrying around the house
   looking for goodies. I actually put together a mini scavenger hunt for
   him too….the final clue leading him to the basket, brimming with
   treats…and the police Legos that he’s been begging for!

     easter2   easter1

   That was followed by a huge feast and another egg hunt at my parents.
   The words “sugar shock” have taken on a whole new meaning.  Wow.

   easter table   easter

   My nearest and dearest friend, Tom, visited from Boston. Whenever he’s
   around it’s unfailingly a good time. Having a great lunch doesn’t hurt
   either. We went to Piora. A lovely spot in the West Village which has
   been on my “list” forever. After our lunch, it has moved from the
   “Restaurants to Try” list to my “Restaurants to Return To. Soon.” List.

   piora 1   piora dining room

   The space itself was so lovely with a very cool graphic line pattern on
   the wall. The meal was stellar. Standouts were the garganelli pasta
   with Brussels sprouts, hedgehog mushrooms and pecorino as well as the
   crème fraiche panna cotta with pear and graham cracker. That dessert
   was just as pretty as the room.

   piora pasta   piora dessert

    The decadent dining continued on the following night when we had a
   knockout meal at French Louie, our new neighborhood spot. The meal
   somehow became more delicious with each course. If you have not been,
   run, don’t walk. When you arrive, be sure to order the smoked sardines,
   le grand socca and roasted king mushroom.  But don’t you dare leave
   without having the pineapple tart tatine. It was really one of the best
   meals I’ve had in a while.

   french lou drinks   french lou

   I cannot end my post without an update on the flora and fauna around
   our house. Here’s what Mother Nature has been up to in our neck of the
   woods:

   apple blossom    baby greens   cherry blossom

   Apple blossoms, baby greens and radishes. And those cherry trees…they
   are officially in full bloom in all of their pink glory.

       Barneys New York was the place I called my second home for six
       years. It was the classroom in which I learned the importance of
       aesthetic, the power of creativity and the joy of indulgence. At a
       point in time which I cannot specifically put my finger on, I
       reflected on my career choices and decided to return to that which
       I really knew... food and humanity's love of it. I began to think
       about my childhood and how much of it had been happily spent in the
       kitchen. The memories of the aromas and flavors that came from my
       grandmother's kitchen were vivid and exhilarating. That is where I
       learned about the ritual and significance of food, the sense of
       happiness and comfort it brought, and the essential elements of
       quality and care that went into its preparation.
