   SMART

   The SMART Labex project aims globally to enhancing the quality of life
   in our digital societies by building the foundational bases for
   facilitating the inclusion of intelligent artifacts in our daily life
   for service and assistance. The project addresses underlying scientific
   questions raised by the development of Human-centered digital systems
   and artifacts in a comprehensive way.

   An efficient and natural interaction with artifacts requires
   understanding human actions and behavior, as well as the design of
   natural and friendly interfaces.  When those artifacts and digital
   devices are disseminated, networked, and sometimes mobile, it is also
   necessary to provide for their connectivity and for knowledge
   extraction, sometimes from massive data,

   Project actions unfold along five dimensions: a) basic research and
   novel concepts; b) methods, technologies and tools for the design,
   operation, interfacing and networking of systems and artifacts
   interacting with humans; c) exploration of novel applications and
   usages; d) education curricula, and e) dissemination and exploitation
   of results.knowledge sharing and access. As an illustrative main usage
   area, source of open topics and case studies for this project, the new
   services induced by the digital society for e-health, including the
   ageing society for e.g., autonomous living.

   The research program is organized along five axes:
     * Modeling of humans
     * Interfaces and Interaction with humans
     * Humans at the convergence of digital and real environments
     * Autonomic Distributed Environments for Mobility
     * Human autonomy and e-health
