   16th IAPR International Conference on
   Discrete Geometry for Computer Imagery
   6-8 April 2011 Nancy, France

DGCI'2011 is the 16th in the series of international conferences on Discrete
Geometry for Computer Imagery.

   The aim of the DGCI conference is to gather researchers in discrete
   geometry and topology, and discrete models, with applications in image
   analysis and image synthesis.
   Discrete geometry plays an expanding role in the fields of shape
   modelling, image synthesis, and image analysis. It deals with
   topological and geometrical definitions of digitized objects or
   digitized images and provides both a theoretical and computational
   framework for computer imaging.
   This edition of DGCI follows the successful 2009 edition held in
   Montreal, Quebec. DGCI 2011 is organized by the ADAGIo team of the
   LORIA laboratory.
