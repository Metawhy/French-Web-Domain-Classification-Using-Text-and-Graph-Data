   The ability to customize AutoCAD to meet your specific needs is a great
   benefit. And the ability to bring your valuable customizations forward
   from a previous release is a necessity!

   The new Migrate Custom Settings tool in AutoCAD 2017 offers a modern
   and informative interface making it easier than ever to migrate you
   custom settings and files from a previous release to AutoCAD 2017.

AU 2015 AutoCAD and LT Classes Now Online

   Just like the holiday season, Autodesk University (AU) 2015 may be gone
   but it doesn’t have to be forgotten. Dozens of recorded AutoCAD®
   classes and AutoCAD LT® classes are now online—and dressed up with a
   festive assortment of downloadable resources—so you can think of
   AU 2015 as the gift that keeps on giving.

   This ski lodge in New Hampshire where we are staying is one. It’s not a
   sad place, necessarily. It was built with an alpine theme in the 1930’s
   by an Austrian baron who was looking to avoid the war.

   accessible from the Annotate ribbon tab. Next to it you’ll find a new
   dimension layer control.

   Dimensions created using the DIM command are automatically placed on
   the specified layer. If an appropriate dimension layer doesn’t
   currently exist in the drawing,
