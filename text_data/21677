Escape to the Wilds of Tasmania in These Eco-Minded Pavilions

   By Lucy Wang – August 8, 2018
   Perched on pink granite cliffs, a series of prefab pavilions offer a
   luxe, back-to-nature experience in one of Tasmania’s oldest National
   Parks.

   Celebrated for its dramatic rock formations and pristine bush
   environment, Tasmania’s Freycinet National Park has become all the more
   alluring with the addition of nine exquisitely crafted pavilions.

   Soon after RACT Destinations acquired the iconic Freycinet Lodge—the
   country’s only national park resort—local architecture firm Liminal
   Studio was tapped to design the Coastal Pavilions, a series of
   one-bedroom suites that offer a luxurious and immersive experience that
   is different from the resort’s existing 60 cabins.

   Freycinet Lodge's Coastal Pavilions overlook Great Oyster Bay and the
   dramatic granite Hazard Mountains.

   Working together with Tasmanian builders Cordwell Lane, the architects
   have designed sustainably minded pavilions that were prefabricated
   offsite for minimal site impact.

   The exterior Red Ironbark cladding was charred—using the Shou Sugi Ban
   technique—to increase the longevity of the timber and as a nod to the
   significance of fire.

   All Coastal Pavilions are outfitted with a king-size bed. They also
   have a separate living area, including an outdoor bathtub, a
   bio-ethanol fireplace, as well as Wi-Fi and local treats.

   The nine structures take cues from their sublime surroundings with
   natural timber finishes, curved forms, and full-height windows that
   effortlessly bring the outdoors in.

   Curved, full-height glazing erases the boundary between indoors and
   out.

   "We have drawn inspiration from this unique setting to influence the
   architecture and interiors of the pavilions," explains Peta Heffernan,
   design director at Liminal Studio.

   "The design has taken its cue from the fluidity and layers of the
   coastal rock formations, the coloring of the rich orange lichen, and
   forms of the nearby bays. The exteriors are treated in a recessive way
   so as not to compete with this beautiful landscape."

   The landscape-inspired interior features a simple color palette of
   grays, oranges, and blues.

   Site placement was a lengthy process as the architects searched to
   optimize seclusion and spectacular views. Specialists, including
   ecologist Mark Wapstra, were brought on board to survey the site and
   ensure minimal landscape impact.

   The coast’s fluid topography is echoed in the interior design with its
   sinuous flow of walls, surfaces, and joinery.

   The interiors are sheathed in offcuts of Tasmanian oak timber and
   Blackwood, and the only plywood that is manufactured locally. This
   application is likely the first time that the Tasmanian plywood,
   typically only used for structural ply, has ever been used for a
   featured finish.

   Solid Tasmanian Oak hardwood with a Whittle Waxes stain finish was
   applied in varying lengths and thicknesses for the wall cladding.
   Tasmanian Oak Delegatensis plywood with the same stain finish line the
   floors and ceilings.

   "Showcasing utilitarian and natural materials in innovative ways has
   created a unique atmosphere befitting of its setting," says a
   representative of Freycinet Lodge.

   The bespoke interiors are also furnished with specially commissioned
   artworks, including pieces by local artists Helene Weeding and
   collaborators Brigitte de Villiers and Bill Cromer of Landslide.

   The bathroom features a spacious walk-in shower lined in charcoal
   porcelain tiles.

   Some pavilions overlook the water, while others are nestled further
   into the coastal bushland.

   The netted, hammock-like balustrades are an innovative solution that
   provides safety and a place for relaxation, while keeping views as
   unobstructed as possible.

   Meticulous detailing was required to create the curved forms. The deck
   is built of Grey Gumand and the roof is topped with Colorbond Trimdeck
   Sheeting in Night Sky Finish.

   The nine pavilions are perched atop the beautiful, weathered pink
   granite of the Freycinet Peninsula.

   Ten prefabricated cabins make up this floating hotel that offers
   privacy and relaxation in a fishing reserve in Avignon, France.

   Designed by the Paris-based Atelier LAVIT, Cabanes des Grands
   Cépages is an eco-hotel made up of a series of prefabricated,
   rectangular and round cabins that float on a lake in southeastern
   France. Situated on a fishing reserve near the city of Avignon, the
   hotel is made of up 10 suites.

   The floating suites are scattered throughout the site.

   Floating on the water like rafts, each cabin is clad with vertical
   wooden screens to ensure the guests' sense of privacy and protect them
   from the sun and wind—mimicking the surrounding water reeds and
   camouflaging the structures into the existing landscape.

   A wooden gangplank leads from shore to suite.

   In order to simplify the construction process in this remote site, the
   project was largely prefabricated in a workshop in the Pyrenees. The
   components were numbered, dismantled, and rebuilt on-site over the
   course of three months. Prefabrication reduced the production and labor
   costs, while impacting the local landscape as little as possible.

   The architecture evokes a rustic construction in the midst of the
   lake's reeds.

   A view of the surrounding wraparound deck and wooden privacy screens

   The privacy screens translate the elegant vertical movement of the
   reeds into a repetitive geometric pattern.

   During the day, the experience inside the suite is a play of light and
   shadow with the sun filtering through the screening.

   The suites offer private outdoor space for lounging.

   Placed on top of Hotel Daniel in Graz, Austria, via a crane, the
   LoftCube is an ingenious addition to an existing midcentury structure.

   Inspired by the concept of adding additional rooftop living quarters to
   the top of urban high rises, Hotel Daniel's owner Florian Weitzer
   cleverly orchestrated the placement of the LoftCube on the roof of his
   centrally located Graz hotel.

   Designed and installed by Berlin-based architect and furniture
   designer Werner Aisslinger, the prefab LoftCube was created off-site
   and installed on the recently renovated hotel's rooftop with a crane.

   Now, this streamlined and stylish private suite is available to rent
   through Boutique Homes.

   Named the "highest suite in town," the self-contained cube is lined
   with a white exterior that's been molded into a soft organic form. It's
   nestled neatly into the wood decking of the hotel's sprawling rooftop
   terrace.

   The 473-square-foot suite features sweeping panoramic views of the
   city, including the iconic Graz clock tower and Schloss Eggenberg.

   The interiors of the cube are brightly lit with ample natural lighting
   that streams in on all sides, thanks to floor-to-ceiling windows.

   Bespoke furnishings emphasize the cube's understated sense of luxury.

   The LoftCube can accommodate two people and starts at €350
   (approximately $407) per night. Bookings can be made here.

iT House, Joshua Tree

   Add to

   By Frances Anderton – February 28, 2009
   The iT House brings together raw industrial aesthetics with the tactics
   of green design to forge a new home in the sunbaked wilds of
   California’s east.

   If you were planning to build yourself a house in the high desert east
   of Los Angeles, where temperatures climb higher than 100 degrees
   Fahrenheit each summer and drop to nearly 32 degrees during the night
   in winter, what kind of habitat would you choose? A solid enclosure
   with thick walls and small windows providing respite from the extreme
   conditions—or a completely exposed glass box without air-conditioning?
   Linda Taalman and Alan Koch, of Taalman Koch Architects, chose the
   latter. Earlier this year, the couple completed work on their glass "iT
   House," a lovely, minimal home that tests the limits of living lightly
   on the land in the desert near Joshua Tree National Park.
   Taalman and Koch are Los Angeles–based design partners who earned their
   stripes with a refined, unobtrusive design for DIA:Beacon in upstate
   New York. A few years ago, they hatched the idea of the iT House. The
   name, conceived with amusing chutzpah, doesn’t refer to "information
   technology," but rather to "It," as in hot, as in "It Girl." Their idea
   was to create a house from prefabricated structural components and
   include glass walls on which artists would later apply surface
   graphics.
   Having already built such a home for a client in Orange County, they
   were eager to construct their own. They looked for a site in L.A., but
   it was too expensive, says Taalman. "We’d been going out to Joshua Tree
   for a long time, and there was something about that place that kept
   drawing us back." So they bought five acres above quirky Pioneertown, a
   onetime set for Westerns that has become a tiny community in its own
   right. They found themselves working on a house that would be a
   backdrop not just for an artist’s application, but for a stunning,
   elemental desertscape. The rolling terrain is dotted with large,
   time-smoothed rocks and arid desert scrub in subtle shades of green,
   yellow, and gray; there are piñon pines, the occasional Joshua tree,
   and jumping cholla cacti with clusters of threatening needles.
   Taalman and Koch started building their house in the middle of 2006,
   just before their daughter, Oleana, was born. The construction was a
   labor of love, a sort of 21st-century barn raising during which they
   and their friends came out on weekends to work together. The result was
   an 1,100-square-foot house that cost approximately $265,000 to build
   (excluding the cost of land). They assembled the Bosch aluminum framing
   system and roofed it in perforated steel decking, creating a bedroom
   wing and a living wing organized around two courtyards. They then
   installed radiant heating in the floors, and built the cabinets out of
   Formica or plastic-laminated plywood. These double as solid walls—in
   fact, they are some of the few vertical planes in the house that are
   not made from glass.
   The basic thinking, Taalman says, was to "take advantage of industries
   outside of the traditional domestic building environment. The iT House
   is a collection of off-the-shelf manufacturing systems that we’ve
   combined—like the Bosch framing usually used in robotics and the Epic
   roof construction system used in airports and malls."
   But the goal was emphatically not to create a prefab product as an end
   in itself. Taalman refutes the notion that "architecture, with a snap
   of the fingers, can follow the automobile industry." She argues,
   instead, that the "fantasy of prefab today, where the building gets
   driven out of the factory and plopped down" onsite, is simply not
   realistic in view of the costs and inefficiencies of transporting such
   a large object. "We are not looking to crack the nut of making a cheap,
   affordable, mass-produced home product," she says. "We’re looking to
   make buildings that have merit but that don’t rely on a single
   contractor and that enable us to take control over the process. We can
   then specify the drawings and get a high-quality product rapidly
   assembled on site."
   Having built the light industrial shell, they then applied another
   layer to the house, with an entirely different aesthetic: that of the
   handcrafted and the custom-made. Their artist  friends, Sarah Morris
   and Liam Gillick, designed a plaid-like grid for the walls, and
   designer Elody Blanchard created floor-to-ceiling curtains for the
   bedroom and bathroom. The curtains in the bedroom are made of thick
   felt, and in the bathroom Blanchard used a cotton blend—in each case,
   with a mesmerizing pattern of thread-lines and grommets.
   The iT House builds on ideas explored over the last century: the
   all-glass house and the house made from industrial components. The
   desert modernist Albert Frey, as well as L.A.’s Case Study House
   architects, traded solid walls for glass—and, of course, Philip Johnson
   put himself on the map with his all-glass house in New Canaan,
   Connecticut. Architects like Pierre Koenig and Craig Ellwood built with
   standardized metal components, and this remains a common approach in
   Europe, first popularized in the 1970s when the Pompidou Center, by
   Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano, made a virtue out of industrial
   aesthetics. However, the iT House is among the few that so harmoniously
   blend high-tech and handmade, harnessing the surrounding landscape. A
   day spent inside Taalman’s and Koch’s house is a day spent marveling at
   the strange, panoramic beauty of the desert and at the subtlety of
   colors, both inside and out. As sunlight passes through the angled
   phases of the day, it transforms the concrete floor and spare
   furnishings into a desert-modern version of a Dutch interior painting.
   The other goal of the house was to embrace, not hide from, the
   elements. Philip Johnson’s glass walls, points out Koch, were
   hermetically sealed. Theirs are not just openable, they are designed to
   function "like a sailboat. You’ve got to work the house to make it
   respond. In the summer, which is very extreme, you close all the
   east-facing doors in the morning and you open up the west—and then you
   flip it in the afternoon." Koch grew up spending summers with his
   architect grandfather in Ventura County, sleeping outside with his
   family on cots in a "hobo camp" that his grandfather designed. "I
   didn’t realize how much being out  in a space like that was important
   to me until we built this house."
   To make such naked shelter possible they employed passive heating and
   cooling strategies—the windows and sliding doors are made of Solar Ban
   60 glass, coated with a low-e coating for long-wave radiation—and the
   roof is configured so that it blocks the summer sun. In winter, when
   the sun is lower and temperatures drop, sunlight can penetrate through
   the windows. Solar power generates hot water and electricity. Despite
   these efforts, however, the couple admits that the house gets very hot
   in summer and very cold in winter.
   But exposure is what they like about it. "It can be really windy
   sometimes and I wonder if it’s going to blow away," says Taalman. "But
   I’m leery of spaces that are over-controlled. I like to know if it’s
   day or night—and when it’s hot, it’s totally different than when it’s
   cold. And when it snows it’s magical. You can see the moon rise and you
   can wake up with the sun. We don’t use any clocks out here."
