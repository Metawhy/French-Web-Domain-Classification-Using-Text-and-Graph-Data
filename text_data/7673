Why choose Brother printers?

   Since building the world's first high-speed Dot-Matrix printer in 1971
   we’ve continued to provide reliable, high-quality printing for a range
   of environments and users.

   From our first Laser printer, delivering high-speed products for the
   office market, our current array of Colour and Mono Laser, Inkjet, and
   Mobile Printers are now at your side, for whatever, whenever and
   wherever you need to print.

   Whether you’re printing photos at home, promotional materials for your
   micro business, presentations in the office or documents across a
   corporate network our products deliver incredible reliability,
   security, and efficiency, as well as a range of digital collaboration
   options.

   Print requirements vary vastly from user to user, so we’ve designed our
   ranges to incorporate this. For instance, our All-in-One printers
   combine the best of our technological knowledge, built up over years,
   to provide quality print, copy, scan and fax all from one machine.
   Others have been specifically configured to particular industry
   sectors, such as healthcare, retail, education and hospitality and
   leisure.

   So whether you’re looking for an Inkjet, Colour Laser, Mono Laser or
   just want to see everything that’s wireless, networked or cloud
   connected, it’s as simple as applying the filters on our printer
   category pages.

   Buy a printer from the Information, Communication and Technology
   Services provider with customer service that’s truly at your side.

   Learn more about Brother Earth and how we are working with you for a
   better environment.

   Also, to get the most out of your printer, find all drivers,
   downloadable tools, utilities and software packages on our
   drivers page.

Mobile printing

   As mobile working practice has become increasing popular so our mobile
   printer ranges have expanded and improved. If you need a compact device
   to print on the move, why not check out the smallest portable thermal
   printer on the market?

   Our PJ600 and PJ700 ranges now form the printing resource for many
   large organisations where mobility is essential.

   Improved documentation and digitisation, advanced collaboration and
   adding efficiency to your mobile working requirements are key to the
   design of our robust and reliable printers.
