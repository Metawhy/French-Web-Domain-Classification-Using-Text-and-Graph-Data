16 simple ways to reduce plastic waste

These easy things can dramatically decrease the amount of plastic trash you
make.

   1 million plastic bags that end up in the trash every minute. (Photo:

   Plastic is found in virtually everything these days. Your food and
   hygiene products are packaged in it. Your car, phone and computer are
   made from it. And you might even chew on it daily in the form of gum.
   While most plastics are touted as recyclable, the reality is that
   they're "downcycled." A plastic milk carton can never be recycled into
   another carton — it can be made into a lower-quality item like plastic
   lumber, which can’t be recycled.

   How big is our plastic problem? Of the 33 million tons of plastic waste
   generated in the U.S. each year, only 7 percent is recycled. This
   plastic waste ends up in landfills, beaches, rivers and oceans and
   contributes to such devastating problems as the Great Pacific Ocean
   Garbage Patch, a swirling vortex of garbage the size of a continent
   where plastic outnumbers plankton. Plus, most plastic is made from oil.

   Luckily, there are simple steps you can take that will dramatically
   decrease the amount of plastic waste you generate.

Just say no to straws

   through a plastic straw? (Photo: Horia Varlan/Flickr)

   One of the easiest ways to keep plastic out of the landfill is to
   refuse plastic straws. Simply inform your waiter or waitress that you
   don't need one, and make sure to specify this when ordering at a
   drive-thru. Can't fathom giving up the convenience of straws? Purchase
   a reusable stainless steel or glass drinking straw. Restaurants are
   less likely to bring you a plastic one if they see that you've brought
   your own.

Use reusable produce bags

   About 1 million plastic bags are used every minute, and a single
   plastic bag can take 1,000 years to degrade. If you're already bringing
   reusable bags to the grocery store, you're on the right track, but if
   you're still using plastic produce bags, it's time to make a change.
   Purchase some reusable produce bags and help keep even more plastic out
   of the landfill. However, avoid those bags made from nylon or polyester
   because they're also made from plastic. Opt for cotton ones instead.

Give up gum

   Gum was originally made from tree sap called chicle, a natural rubber,
   but when scientists created synthetic rubber, polyethylene and
   polyvinyl acetate began to replace the natural rubber in most gum. Not
   only are you chewing on plastic, but you may also be chewing on toxic
   plastic — polyvinyl acetate is manufactured using vinyl acetate, a
   chemical shown to cause tumors in lab rats. While it is possible to
   recycle your gum, it may be best to skip it — and its plastic packaging
   — altogether.

Buy boxes, not bottles

   Buy laundry detergent and dish soap in boxes instead of plastic
   bottles. Cardboard can be more easily recycled and made into more
   products than plastic.

Buy from bulk bins

   Many stores, such as Whole Foods, sell bulk foods like rice, pasta,
   beans, nuts, cereal and granola, and opting to fill a reusable bag or
   container with these items will save both money and unnecessary
   packaging. Stores have various methods for deducting the container
   weight so simply check with customer service before filling your
   container. Also, many cotton bags have their weights printed on their
   tags so they can simply be deducted at the checkout.

Reuse glass containers

   You can buy a variety of prepared foods in glass jars instead of
   plastic ones, including spaghetti sauce, peanut butter, salsa and
   applesauce, just to name a few. Instead of throwing these away or
   recycling them, reuse the jars to store food or take them with you when
   you’re buying bulk foods. If you have plastic containers leftover from
   yogurt, butter or other food, don’t throw them out. Simply wash them
   and use them to store food.

Use reusable bottles and cups

   bottle. (Photo: Seven Depolo/Flickr)

   Bottled water produces 1.5 million tons of plastic waste per year, and
   these bottles require 47 millions gallons of oil to produce, according
   to Food & Water Watch. By simply refilling a reusable bottle, you’ll
   prevent some of these plastic bottles from ending up in landfills and
   oceans — but don’t stop there. Bring a reusable cup to coffee shops and
   ask the barista to fill it up, and keep a mug at your desk instead of
   using plastic, paper or Styrofoam cups. The average American office
   worker uses about 500 disposable cups a year so you’ll be preventing a
   lot of unnecessary waste.

Bring your own container

   Whether you're picking up takeout or bringing home your restaurant
   leftovers, be prepared with your own reusable containers. When you
   place your order, ask if you can get the food placed in your own
   container. Most restaurants will have no problem with it.

Use matches

   If you need to light a candle, build a campfire or start a fire for any
   other reason, opt for matches over disposable plastic lighters. These
   cheap plastic devices sit in landfills for years and have even been
   found in dead birds' stomachs. If you can't bear to part with your
   lighter, pick up a refillable metal one to help cut down on waste.

Skip the frozen foods section

   Frozen foods offer both convenience and plenty of plastic packaging —
   even those eco-friendly packaged items made from cardboard are actually
   coated in a thin layer of plastic. While giving up frozen food can be
   difficult, there are benefits besides the obvious environmental ones:
   You'll be eating fewer processed foods and avoiding the chemicals in
   the packaging.

Don't use plasticware

   Say goodbye to disposable chopsticks, knives, spoons, forks and even
   sporks. If you often forget to pack silverware in your lunch, or if you
   know your favorite restaurant only has plasticware, start keeping a set
   of utensils. It's sure to reduce your carbon forkprint.

Return reusable containers

   refillable. Take them back to the market with you. (Photo:

   If you buy berries or cherry tomatoes at the farmers market, simply
   bring the plastic containers to the market when you need a refill. You
   can even ask your local grocer to take the containers back and reuse
   them.

Use cloth diapers

   According to the EPA, 7.6 billion pounds of disposable diapers are
   discarded in the U.S. each year. Plus, it takes about 80,000 pounds of
   plastic and more than 200,000 trees a year to manufacture disposable
   diapers for American babies alone. By simply switching to cloth
   diapers, you'll not only reduce your baby's carbon footprint, you'll
   also save money.

Don't buy juice

   Instead of buying juice in plastic bottles, make your own
   fresh-squeezed juice or simply eat fresh fruit. Not only does this cut
   down on plastic waste, but it's also better for you because you'll be
   getting more vitamins and antioxidants and less high fructose corn
   syrup.

Clean green

   plastic pollution With a few simple changes, you don't have to
   contribute to this sea of plastic trash. (Photo: Horia Varlan/Flickr)

   There's no need for multiple plastic bottles of tile cleaner, toilet
   cleaner and window cleaner if you have a few basics on hand like baking
   soda and vinegar. So free up some space, save some cash, and avoid
   those toxic chemicals by making your own cleaning products.

Pack a lunch the right way

   If your lunchbox is full of disposable plastic containers and sandwich
   bags, it's time to make a change. Instead of packing snacks and
   sandwiches in bags, put them in reusable containers you have at home,
   or try lunch accessories like reusable snack bags. You can also opt for
   fresh fruit instead of single-serving fruit cups, and buy items like
   yogurt and pudding in bulk and simply put a portion in a reusable dish
   for lunch.

16 simple ways to reduce plastic waste

These easy things can dramatically decrease the amount of plastic trash you
make.

   1 million plastic bags that end up in the trash every minute. (Photo:

   Plastic is found in virtually everything these days. Your food and
   hygiene products are packaged in it. Your car, phone and computer are
   made from it. And you might even chew on it daily in the form of gum.
   While most plastics are touted as recyclable, the reality is that
   they're "downcycled." A plastic milk carton can never be recycled into
   another carton — it can be made into a lower-quality item like plastic
   lumber, which can’t be recycled.

   How big is our plastic problem? Of the 33 million tons of plastic waste
   generated in the U.S. each year, only 7 percent is recycled. This
   plastic waste ends up in landfills, beaches, rivers and oceans and
   contributes to such devastating problems as the Great Pacific Ocean
   Garbage Patch, a swirling vortex of garbage the size of a continent
   where plastic outnumbers plankton. Plus, most plastic is made from oil.

   Luckily, there are simple steps you can take that will dramatically
   decrease the amount of plastic waste you generate.

Just say no to straws

   through a plastic straw? (Photo: Horia Varlan/Flickr)

   One of the easiest ways to keep plastic out of the landfill is to
   refuse plastic straws. Simply inform your waiter or waitress that you
   don't need one, and make sure to specify this when ordering at a
   drive-thru. Can't fathom giving up the convenience of straws? Purchase
   a reusable stainless steel or glass drinking straw. Restaurants are
   less likely to bring you a plastic one if they see that you've brought
   your own.

Use reusable produce bags

   About 1 million plastic bags are used every minute, and a single
   plastic bag can take 1,000 years to degrade. If you're already bringing
   reusable bags to the grocery store, you're on the right track, but if
   you're still using plastic produce bags, it's time to make a change.
   Purchase some reusable produce bags and help keep even more plastic out
   of the landfill. However, avoid those bags made from nylon or polyester
   because they're also made from plastic. Opt for cotton ones instead.

Give up gum

   Gum was originally made from tree sap called chicle, a natural rubber,
   but when scientists created synthetic rubber, polyethylene and
   polyvinyl acetate began to replace the natural rubber in most gum. Not
   only are you chewing on plastic, but you may also be chewing on toxic
   plastic — polyvinyl acetate is manufactured using vinyl acetate, a
   chemical shown to cause tumors in lab rats. While it is possible to
   recycle your gum, it may be best to skip it — and its plastic packaging
   — altogether.

Buy boxes, not bottles

   Buy laundry detergent and dish soap in boxes instead of plastic
   bottles. Cardboard can be more easily recycled and made into more
   products than plastic.

Buy from bulk bins

   Many stores, such as Whole Foods, sell bulk foods like rice, pasta,
   beans, nuts, cereal and granola, and opting to fill a reusable bag or
   container with these items will save both money and unnecessary
   packaging. Stores have various methods for deducting the container
   weight so simply check with customer service before filling your
   container. Also, many cotton bags have their weights printed on their
   tags so they can simply be deducted at the checkout.

Reuse glass containers

   You can buy a variety of prepared foods in glass jars instead of
   plastic ones, including spaghetti sauce, peanut butter, salsa and
   applesauce, just to name a few. Instead of throwing these away or
   recycling them, reuse the jars to store food or take them with you when
   you’re buying bulk foods. If you have plastic containers leftover from
   yogurt, butter or other food, don’t throw them out. Simply wash them
   and use them to store food.

Use reusable bottles and cups

   bottle. (Photo: Seven Depolo/Flickr)

   Bottled water produces 1.5 million tons of plastic waste per year, and
   these bottles require 47 millions gallons of oil to produce, according
   to Food & Water Watch. By simply refilling a reusable bottle, you’ll
   prevent some of these plastic bottles from ending up in landfills and
   oceans — but don’t stop there. Bring a reusable cup to coffee shops and
   ask the barista to fill it up, and keep a mug at your desk instead of
   using plastic, paper or Styrofoam cups. The average American office
   worker uses about 500 disposable cups a year so you’ll be preventing a
   lot of unnecessary waste.

Bring your own container

   Whether you're picking up takeout or bringing home your restaurant
   leftovers, be prepared with your own reusable containers. When you
   place your order, ask if you can get the food placed in your own
   container. Most restaurants will have no problem with it.

Use matches

   If you need to light a candle, build a campfire or start a fire for any
   other reason, opt for matches over disposable plastic lighters. These
   cheap plastic devices sit in landfills for years and have even been
   found in dead birds' stomachs. If you can't bear to part with your
   lighter, pick up a refillable metal one to help cut down on waste.

Skip the frozen foods section

   Frozen foods offer both convenience and plenty of plastic packaging —
   even those eco-friendly packaged items made from cardboard are actually
   coated in a thin layer of plastic. While giving up frozen food can be
   difficult, there are benefits besides the obvious environmental ones:
   You'll be eating fewer processed foods and avoiding the chemicals in
   the packaging.

Don't use plasticware

   Say goodbye to disposable chopsticks, knives, spoons, forks and even
   sporks. If you often forget to pack silverware in your lunch, or if you
   know your favorite restaurant only has plasticware, start keeping a set
   of utensils. It's sure to reduce your carbon forkprint.

Return reusable containers

   refillable. Take them back to the market with you. (Photo:

   If you buy berries or cherry tomatoes at the farmers market, simply
   bring the plastic containers to the market when you need a refill. You
   can even ask your local grocer to take the containers back and reuse
   them.

Use cloth diapers

   According to the EPA, 7.6 billion pounds of disposable diapers are
   discarded in the U.S. each year. Plus, it takes about 80,000 pounds of
   plastic and more than 200,000 trees a year to manufacture disposable
   diapers for American babies alone. By simply switching to cloth
   diapers, you'll not only reduce your baby's carbon footprint, you'll
   also save money.

Don't buy juice

   Instead of buying juice in plastic bottles, make your own
   fresh-squeezed juice or simply eat fresh fruit. Not only does this cut
   down on plastic waste, but it's also better for you because you'll be
   getting more vitamins and antioxidants and less high fructose corn
   syrup.

Clean green

   plastic pollution With a few simple changes, you don't have to
   contribute to this sea of plastic trash. (Photo: Horia Varlan/Flickr)

   There's no need for multiple plastic bottles of tile cleaner, toilet
   cleaner and window cleaner if you have a few basics on hand like baking
   soda and vinegar. So free up some space, save some cash, and avoid
   those toxic chemicals by making your own cleaning products.

Pack a lunch the right way

   If your lunchbox is full of disposable plastic containers and sandwich
   bags, it's time to make a change. Instead of packing snacks and
   sandwiches in bags, put them in reusable containers you have at home,
   or try lunch accessories like reusable snack bags. You can also opt for
   fresh fruit instead of single-serving fruit cups, and buy items like
   yogurt and pudding in bulk and simply put a portion in a reusable dish
   for lunch.
