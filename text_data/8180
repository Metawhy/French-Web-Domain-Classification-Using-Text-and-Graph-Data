New Report: One Year In, Chocolate Industry Commitments Fail to Stop
Deforestation

   Over half of Ivorian protected areas reviewed saw deforestation
   increase after corporate pledges

   ABIDJAN AND WASHINGTON, DC, DECEMBER 7, 2018 – Despite the chocolate
   industry’s pledge to cease sourcing cocoa linked to deforestation one
   year ago, a new Mighty Earth report finds that deforestation in West
   Africa for cocoa has continued, and in some cases has increased. The
   report, Behind the Wrapper: Greenwashing in the Chocolate Industry,
   identifies deforestation hotspots, including in protected areas and
   national parks, putting some of the last refuges for forest elephants
   and chimpanzees at risk and threatening the stability of the regional
   climate. In Côte d’Ivoire, satellite analysis recorded approximately
   13,748 hectares of deforestation in the cocoa-growing Southwest region
   alone, between November 2017 and September 2018. This forest loss is
   equivalent to 15,000 football fields.

   Last year, the world’s largest chocolate and cocoa companies like
   Hershey’s and Lindt stood beside representatives of the two primary
   cocoa-producing countries, Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana, and committed to
   transform their industry, creating the Cocoa and Forests Initiative
   (CFI). They pledged to end deforestation linked to the production of
   cocoa, and promised to make the production of cocoa compatible with
   environmental protection and human rights.

   Approaching the one-year anniversary of these commitments, Mighty Earth
   used a combination of satellites, drones, and on-the-ground field teams
   to identify how – and if – these commitments are being implemented in
   Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana.

   The report found that over half of the Ivorian forest areas reviewed
   showed an increase in their rates of deforestation since the
   announcement of the CFI one year ago. This deforestation violates the
   most fundamental tenet of the chocolate industry’s and governments’
   commitment: to end new cultivation of cocoa in national parks and
   protected areas.

   “The governments of Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana have clearly failed to
   clamp down on this ongoing deforestation,” said Etelle Higonnet of
   Mighty Earth. “The chocolate industry has spent the last year
   celebrating itself for its commitments to immediately cease
   deforestation from cocoa, but the chocolate industry continues to buy
   cocoa from suppliers linked to the destruction of some of West Africa’s
   last forests.”

   Mighty Earth’s field team documented that farmers who engaged in
   deforestation for cocoa were still able to openly sell their cocoa to
   chocolate companies without repercussions. Farmers caught clearing
   forest for cocoa told investigators that they did not face sanctions,
   any cuts in supply chains, or even warnings. In the Goin Debé
   classified forest, for example, not much had changed since Mighty
   Earth’s initial 2017 investigation. One forest had been cleared and
   planted with cocoa just two days before researchers arrived – in the
   same protected area inspected less than a year prior. The field
   investigation documented children laboring in cocoa fields as well.

   “Mighty Earth applauded the commitments made last year, but we know
   that corporate pledges are only as valuable as their follow-through,”
   said Higonnet. “We did document some areas where clear progress has
   been made, so we know it’s possible for companies and local authorities
   to make positive change. But companies like Cadbury and SucDen still
   refuse to accept global deforestation-free policies. Unacceptable
   deforestation and child labor is still happening in front of our eyes.
   Industry and the governments in cocoa producing countries must address
   the unacceptable discrepancy between commitments and implementation.
   And they must do so urgently, before the next deforestation ‘peak
   danger season’ – which begins in January – irreversibly damages the
   ecosystems of West Africa.”

Key Pillars.
     __________________________________________________________________

     * We start with common ground.
       We believe in the fundamental goodness and decency of people. We
       don’t approach opponents as enemies or adversaries: we recognize
       them, as humans with strongly held convictions, interests and
       motivations, just like us. When we can make progress through
       negotiation or consensus, we go for it. Because we know that
       effecting lasting change is not a zero-sum game: if we can
       eliminate “winning” and “losing” from the equation, we’re that much
       closer to our goal.
     * We’re prepared to act now.
       We have the courage, experience and resources to move quickly and
       hit hard—but never without a deliberate strategy. If our initial
       strategy fails, we simply regroup and bounce back with an equally
       viable angle. Whether taking on an interest group or the CEO of a
       Fortune-100 company, we persevere because we are unafraid and
       inexhaustible. When it comes to protecting the Earth and its
       creatures, no ght is too big or too small.
     * We seek lasting change, not power.
       Our agenda doesn’t end with us. To realize our ambitious goals, we
       need a movement— we can’t do it alone. Big things happen when we
       can inspire others to join our ght, so we seek out and empower
       like-minded people to act. If we are successful in our pursuit, we
       don’t need personal recognition.
