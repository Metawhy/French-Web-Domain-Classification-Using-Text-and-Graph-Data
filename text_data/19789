About us

   Innopain is a biopharmaceutical company, based in Clermont Ferrand
   (France), focused on discovering and developing new chemical entities,
   first-in-class analgesic drugs, to treat pain, without inducing many of
   the side effects associated with current therapies.

   Our ambition is to develop innovative compounds to reach the human
   proof of concept (clinical trials phase 2) of efficacy and safety for
   moderate to severe acute and chronic pain.

   The development of these compounds, TREK-1 agonists, is the result of
   our world-class research in pharmacology and medicinal chemistry
   especially on the involvement of TREK-1 and its direct activation,
   acting downstream from the µ-opioid receptor (µOR), having strong
   analgesic effects without opioid-like adverse effects.

Innovation

Context

   Today, morphine remains the treatment of reference for severe acute or
   chronic pains. Its analgesic effect is often accompanied by adverse
   side effects such as constipation, respiratory depression, and
   dependence.
   This opioid drug produces its pharmacological action by interacting
   with the μ-opioid receptor (μOR).

TREK-1, a new target to treat pain

   Pharmacologists from Professor Eschalier team (Neurodol – UMR 1107
   Inserm Université d’Auvergne)  and Professor Lazundski & Lesage team
   (IPMC UMR7275) reported that the beneﬁcial and adverse effects of
   morphine could be dissociated by demonstrating that TREK-1 contributed
   to the analgesic effect of morphine but not to its adverse side
   effects.

   These observations suggest that direct activation of the TREK-1 channel
   by acting downstream from μOR might have a strong analgesic effect
   without opioid-ligand adverse effects

   In vivo they have demonstrated that analgesia is the direct result of
   activating the TREK-1 potassium channel.
   This significant discovery was published in Nature in 2013 after
   securing a patent covering the screening for pain of TREK and TRAK
   agonists^(1).
   In addition, the team’s chemists have (Professor Sylvie Ducki)
   synthesized a family of agonists NCEs which are protected by a second
   patent.

   Further development has enabled the identification of a lead compound
   coded RNE 28 which shows promising in vivo activity and safety^(2)^(3).

   Innopain has an exclusive worldwide license of these two patents and
   our mission is to develop this innovative approch to treat pain, acute
   and chronic.

Deliver innovative medicines

   Innopain develops original analgesics to replace morphine without its
   side effects.
   The objective of Innopain is to reach the Proof Of Concept for
   intravenous and oral administration, for acute and chronic pain. Our
   strategy is to quickly reach these POC with an optimized development
   plan.
   Since the beginning of Innopain (August 2015) we have focused on 3 main
   steps: drug substance development, validation of the efficiency in
   animals, safety of compound in animal models and absence of side
   effects like constipation, dependency and addiction.

   Learn more about our results and develoment plan

     RNE28 is a new chemical entity, for intravenous and oral
     administration, susceptible to be the first representative of a new
     class of analgesic drugs. Innopain aims to develop this major
     pharmacological innovation from preclinical to clinical Phase II and
     to demonstrate safety and efficacy in human.

Optim'Dol

   Optim’Dol is a program which benefits of a partial financing from
   European FEDER (Fonds Européen de Développement Régional)

   This program fits within one of the strategic innovation domains
   supported by the region Auvergne Rhone Alpes, i.e. the prevention and
   treatment of pain. This region regroups within the Analgesia cluster
   several university research teams in pharmacology and chemistry, and
   private companies which have been collaborating for several years in
   the field of pain, notably to develop new innovative drug candidates.
   These collaborations have led to the creation of the Analgesia
   Institute, which has been certified by the French Research Ministry
   (MESR) as a research foundation. Indeed, this recognizes the expertise
   gathered over 20 years in the analysis and approaches of pain
   pathologies, and of the public-private collaborations initiated over
   the last 8 years. Optim’dol regroups 2 companies, ANS Biotech and
   Innopain, and 2 research teams Neurodol-Auvergne University for
   pharmacology   and ICCF-Sigma University for chemistry all part of
   Analgesia Institute. The objective of the program, through this
   multidisciplinary collaboration, is to design and develop new analgesic
   non opioid chemical entities to treat acute and chronic moderate to
   severe pain.

   This includes:
     * Design and development of NCEs, back up of the chemical series
       currently being developed, agonists of the pharmacological TREK
       target, in order to replace morphine an opioid derivates as
       powerful analgesic avoiding the side effects of opiates. The
       objective is to obtain 5 NCEs well characterized and ready to move
       into regulatory preclinical development.
     * The development and qualification of different pain pharmacological
       tests on mice which together will permit primary screening of
       molecules for pain treatment. The objective is to offer 3 kits,
       part of a logical pathway, in order to optimize the screening.

     This program takes advantage of complementary expertise: research of
     each member will enrich the joint program, cross feeding to speed
     the development of new qualified NCEs and pharmacological services.
     Innopain shall interface with ANS to screen the molecules issued
     from the works of ICCF and Neurodol. ANS shall be in in a position
     to further qualify the tests initiated by Neurodol applied to the
     Innopain’s molecules and to offer optimized preclinical services to
     potential clients.

   This synergy of expertise, applied to market needs, will contribute to
   progress and speed up preclinical research.

   The financial subsidy obtained for this program comes from FEDER and is
   linked to Initiative for Innovation in Healthcare S3 (2016-2018):
   optimization of drug candidates for pain treatment.
