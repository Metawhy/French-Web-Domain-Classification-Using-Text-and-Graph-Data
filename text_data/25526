what moms are saying…

     * “Ready to take on genetics! Another huge
       thanks to TinySuperheroes for his cape.
       This is our first appointment since we got
       it and he’s a different boy. He flew all the
       way into the office and hasn’t cried once!”
       – Torre Skornia
     * “His cape has gone with us to each and every
       neurosurgery and neurology appointment and
       we always get comments on it. Thank you for
       providing such a comfort to my son during this
       crazy, scary time!”
       -Laura Barron
     * “We picked up the package at our town post
       office today. The postal worker was so excited to
       deliver this surprise addressed to Super William!
       I opened it right there in line, put his cape on,
       and wasn’t the only one there teary-eyed.”
       -Angela Olmo VanDerwerken
     * “Thank you for everything. Your company is
       amazing. The smile it put on Cooper’s face
       was priceless and then to have Oliver receive
       one as well (as he is usually overlooked since
       we have the other two with rare diseases).
       He was so excited.”
       -Mandi Holliday
     * “She sure loves her cape to this day! It is
       proudly displayed in her room when she
       is not wearing it! Still so many ups and
       downs for her, but she often remarks,
       when she sees her cape, ‘There are lots
       of kids with lots of hard times. It’s cool
       we can all be together with our capes!”
       -Anna Barber
     * “Cade absolutely LOVES his cape. He really
       feels like it empowers him to do great things.
       It’s absolutely heartening to know that something
       so “tiny” can make such an enormous impact.
       Thank you so so very much!!!!”
     * “You have given my TinySuperhero so
       much confidence! He can’t wait to wear
       his cape to the hospital for his next therapy
       session! His little brother is ecstatic to have
       his own cape too! Thank you for putting a
       huge smile on my boys’ faces!!!”
       -Shira Raymond
