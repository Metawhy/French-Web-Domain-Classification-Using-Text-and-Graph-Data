Summary

   Accessible and essential coverage of today's challenging, speculative,
   cutting-edge science from Quanta Magazine.

   If you're a science and data nerd like me, you may be interested in
   "Alice and Bob Meet the Wall of Fire" and "The Prime Number Conspiracy"
   from Quanta Magazine and Thomas Lin. - Bill Gates

   These stories reveal the latest efforts to untangle the mysteries of
   the universe. Bringing together the best and most interesting science
   stories appearing in Quanta Magazine over the past five years, Alice
   and Bob Meet the Wall of Fire reports on some of the greatest
   scientific minds as they test the limits of human knowledge. Quanta,
   under editor-in-chief Thomas Lin, is the only popular publication that
   offers in-depth coverage of today's challenging, speculative,
   cutting-edge science. It communicates science by taking it seriously,
   wrestling with difficult concepts and clearly explaining them in a way
   that speaks to our innate curiosity about our world and ourselves.

   In the title story, Alice and Bob—beloved characters of various thought
   experiments in physics—grapple with gravitational forces, possible
   spaghettification, and a massive wall of fire as Alice jumps into a
   black hole. Another story considers whether the universe is impossible,
   in light of experimental results at the Large Hadron Collider. We learn
   about quantum reality and the mystery of quantum entanglement; explore
   the source of time's arrow; and witness a eureka moment when a quantum
   physicist exclaims: “Finally, we can understand why a cup of coffee
   equilibrates in a room.” We reflect on humans' enormous skulls and the
   Brain Boom; consider the evolutionary benefits of loneliness; peel back
   the layers of the newest artificial-intelligence algorithms; follow the
   “battle for the heart and soul of physics”; and mourn the disappearance
   of the “diphoton bump,” revealed to be a statistical fluctuation rather
   than a revolutionary new particle. These stories from Quanta give us a
   front-row seat to scientific discovery.

Summary

   Accessible and essential coverage of today's challenging, speculative,
   cutting-edge science from Quanta Magazine.

   If you're a science and data nerd like me, you may be interested in
   "Alice and Bob Meet the Wall of Fire" and "The Prime Number Conspiracy"
   from Quanta Magazine and Thomas Lin. - Bill Gates

   These stories reveal the latest efforts to untangle the mysteries of
   the universe. Bringing together the best and most interesting science
   stories appearing in Quanta Magazine over the past five years, Alice
   and Bob Meet the Wall of Fire reports on some of the greatest
   scientific minds as they test the limits of human knowledge. Quanta,
   under editor-in-chief Thomas Lin, is the only popular publication that
   offers in-depth coverage of today's challenging, speculative,
   cutting-edge science. It communicates science by taking it seriously,
   wrestling with difficult concepts and clearly explaining them in a way
   that speaks to our innate curiosity about our world and ourselves.

   In the title story, Alice and Bob—beloved characters of various thought
   experiments in physics—grapple with gravitational forces, possible
   spaghettification, and a massive wall of fire as Alice jumps into a
   black hole. Another story considers whether the universe is impossible,
   in light of experimental results at the Large Hadron Collider. We learn
   about quantum reality and the mystery of quantum entanglement; explore
   the source of time's arrow; and witness a eureka moment when a quantum
   physicist exclaims: “Finally, we can understand why a cup of coffee
   equilibrates in a room.” We reflect on humans' enormous skulls and the
   Brain Boom; consider the evolutionary benefits of loneliness; peel back
   the layers of the newest artificial-intelligence algorithms; follow the
   “battle for the heart and soul of physics”; and mourn the disappearance
   of the “diphoton bump,” revealed to be a statistical fluctuation rather
   than a revolutionary new particle. These stories from Quanta give us a
   front-row seat to scientific discovery.
