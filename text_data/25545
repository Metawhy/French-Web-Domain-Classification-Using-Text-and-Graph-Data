Revolutionising Industrial Furniture.

   Steel Vintage is a passionate family run business with a very focused
   ambition. To produce the very best high-end bespoke industrial
   furniture in the world, that will last generations while creating a
   minimal impact on the environment. To achieve this, we ensure that all
   items are designed precisely and then manufactured by our
   multidisciplinary team of talented professionals. All of this happens
   from our creative design studio and production workshop based in
   Bristol, England.

   Our industrial furniture range is original and unique to us. Each new
   design is founded on a traditional vintage industrial style while
   ensuring modern functionality. All products are expertly handmade from
   a carefully selected palette of raw materials, including Oak, Walnut,
   Steel, Brass, and Copper. By using a mixture of the latest
   manufacturing processes and hand finishing, no two pieces are exactly
   alike, each having individual characteristics.

   Products such as our Brunel table and Workshop modular desk take pride
   of place in contemporary homes and businesses across the USA, Canada,
   Japan, Australia, throughout the UK and the rest of Europe.

   We hope you enjoy our new website where you can view all of our
   latest Products, find Inspiration and learn more About our company.
