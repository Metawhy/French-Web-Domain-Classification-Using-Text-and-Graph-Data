   Ireland at the heart of Europe

Ireland at the heart of Europe

   Ireland is a committed member of the European Union and provides
   companies with guaranteed access to the European market.  Ireland is
   the only English speaking country in the Eurozone and provides an ideal
   hub for organisations seeking a European base. The brightest talent
   from across Europe is attracted here, mixing with our own to offer a
   multinational and multilingual melting pot of skills with a positive
   attitude to match.
   Reasons to Invest

Our people and your business, a winning combination

   There are many reasons why companies locate themselves in Ireland, but
   it all starts with positive leadership and policies. Successive
   governments have developed an open economy and invested heavily to
   develop Ireland's infrastructure. This has allowed the IDA, a
   semi-state body, to continue to attract high-performing industries to
   our shores, even through challenging times.

Local impact

   For every 10 jobs created by Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in
   Ireland, 8 more jobs are generated in the wider economy.  There are
   over 210,000 people in Ireland working directly in IDA Ireland client
   companies.  But the story, and the success doesn’t stop there.  Around
   these companies more enterprises and more jobs are created.  Ireland’s
   indigenous entrepreneurs see and seize the opportunity to create new
   businesses.  Creating new jobs.
   Read the supplement to better understand the impact FDI is having on
   local economies throughout Ireland.
