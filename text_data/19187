       IT'S FINALLY HERE! My capsule collection with Fashion to Figure
   launches today and I'm sitting here sweating while I type this. I mean,
   sweaty hands, sweaty underboobs, all of it. This collection consists of
     thigh-high boots for thicky thick legs, bad bitch accessories, and
                                    more.

    You know what's funny. I want to tell this story about me and FTF. In
   early 2012, when I first moved up North, I was living in NJ for a month
   until I landed an apartment in Harlem. FTF had a store inside a NJ mall
     and I went there to apply for an assistant manager position. I only
      moved up North with $1,000 that I saved while working at a little
     Middle Eastern restaurant in the food court while in Florida. So, I
    needed to find a job ASAP. I had landed a different job in NYC RIGHT
   before FTF reached out for me to come in for an interview. It's so wild
    to think in 2012 I applied for a job there, literally could have been
     an assistant manager at one of their stores, and now I have my own
   capsule collection with them years later. The Universe really does work
    in mysterious ways. Foreshadowing at its finest. The world was trying
     to give me clues like...BITCH, WORK HARD AND WE'LL SET YOU UP. LMAO

   Either way, this collection has been a DREAM to design. The team at FTF
      is really so creative, patient, hard workers, and they truly make
   things happen. All of the heels are wide width and the thigh-high boots
     are wide width AND wide calf. I've always had difficulties finding
   thigh high boots that fit me right. It would always be such a let down
    when shopping. I knew if I had this problem, so many of you did too.
    Which was obvious because whenever I'd shimmy myself into a pair, I'd
    get hundreds of comments like WHERE DID YOU GET THOSE?! Sometimes I'd
   even cut a slit in the back upper thigh and then put a little string in
     the back to make it look like it was made that way. I'm a finesser.
                               What can I say?

     Everything is either shoes, or accessories, except for ONE piece of
    actual clothing. I designed a cute little long sleeve bodysuit romper
   with a draped back. It's super stretch and comfy. It goes so well will
   with all of the thigh high boots. It's perfect for a club situation, a
               dinner situation, or just to be cute situation.

   On another note: I really can't wait to hear all of your feedback. I'm
      dying for you all to get your stuff so that I can see all of your
    pictures and repost them. Nothing feels better to me, honestly, than
   seeing all of you guys feeling like you're THAT BITCH (because you are)
   while wearing my stuff. We made hair pins that say THAT BITCH and even
    the inside of my shoe boxes say REMINDER: YOU'RE THAT BITCH. I mean,
     because you are, DUH. Okay, last but not least, I just want to say
        thank you so much to FTF and thank you to all of you who have
                continuously supported me. I love you all. xx

   FULL STORY

   I've been on the move this Fashion Week. Can you believe I've left the
    house 2 days in a row, going on 3? Who am I even? LOL. To be honest,
   this fashion week I've toned down my looks some, keeping it more simple
    and easy to move around. It could be the weather and the heat that's
   been stopping me from pulling out less simple looks. My jeans are from
    Universal Standard. I'm wearing a size 12. You can get the exact ones
     HERE! I cut a little slit in the side of each leg just because. How
   cute is this little cardigan top? It's also from US and you can get it
                                    HERE.

    I’m so honored to be a part of Universal Standard's #FashionFreedom
      campaign that truly stands by the motto of All of Us. As we are.
       Anywhere. I was always asked how I was able to be so confident,
    especially around others. My answer every time is that fashion really
   helped me build confidence. It helped me express myself and regardless
    of my size, I feel it’s incredibly important to live in the moment
   whatever journey you’re on. This subway campaign really embodies that
    and I’m truly grateful. US is a brand that has changed the fashion
     industry with their size range 00-40, but they also have something
    called Fit Liberty. I first learned about it when I went to their NY
    office 2 years back. Anything you purchase is eligible for a one-year
   size exchange. Coming from someone who fluctuates in sizes quite often,
                       it’s extremely life-changing.

   FULL STORY

   I got this pink mini dress from Femme Luxe. A few posts back I wore the
    same dress in black. Am I the only one that when they find a piece of
   clothing they truly love, they purchase it in all the colors available?
   On their site they also have this exact dress in white and red. I'm on
                 the verge of getting the red one too. 😭

   On a side note, NYFW is here so I'm throwing this post up before things
   get hectic on my end. This Fashion Week I decided I'm only going to 5-
   or 6 events. I'm tired of overwhelming myself and over the years, I've
    learned I don't have to say yes to everything or everyone. I laughed
    when I saw on Instagram someone post a meme saying "September is the
       January of Fashion." It's lowkey true. But more importantly, my
     birthday is 10 days away and the older I get, the less excited I am
                               about it. LMAO.

     This week I've been in full work mode and I"m actually excited and
   inspired for the first time in a minute. I have a big photoshoot coming
    up this Wednesday and I can't wait until you guys see it on September
    20th. Keep an eye out for it! On a side note, wrap dresses are always
   my go-to especially for the Summer. They're just so easy to wear, they
    look beautiful, and it feels like I'm not wearing anything but a moo
    moo dress. lol. I can't stop listening to Megan Thee Stallion. Thank
       God for her because I have some cocky lyrics to use again on my
    Instagram captions. My dress is from ASOS last Summer and they don't
    have the exact one anymore so I put some similar ones below. My heels
    are vintage from Sergio Rossi that I bought from The Real Real. I put
           similar strap heels below as well! xx nadia wrap dress

   the show makes my day better. I can't even tell you how many times I've
    watched all the seasons. In my actual day to day talks, I use so many

     My color this Summer has to be orange. I got this orange mini dress
    from Femme Luxe. They have sooo many cute bright colored dresses that
    are perfect for Summertime. Can you believe it's August? I don't even
   know where the year went. August means it's close to Junior's birthday

Nadia x FTF

       IT'S FINALLY HERE! My capsule collection with Fashion to Figure
   launches today and I'm sitting here sweating while I type this. I mean,
   sweaty hands, sweaty underboobs, all of it. This collection consists of
     thigh-high boots for thicky thick legs, bad bitch accessories, and
                                    more.

    You know what's funny. I want to tell this story about me and FTF. In
   early 2012, when I first moved up North, I was living in NJ for a month
   until I landed an apartment in Harlem. FTF had a store inside a NJ mall
     and I went there to apply for an assistant manager position. I only
      moved up North with $1,000 that I saved while working at a little
     Middle Eastern restaurant in the food court while in Florida. So, I
    needed to find a job ASAP. I had landed a different job in NYC RIGHT
   before FTF reached out for me to come in for an interview. It's so wild
    to think in 2012 I applied for a job there, literally could have been
     an assistant manager at one of their stores, and now I have my own
   capsule collection with them years later. The Universe really does work
    in mysterious ways. Foreshadowing at its finest. The world was trying
     to give me clues like...BITCH, WORK HARD AND WE'LL SET YOU UP. LMAO

   Either way, this collection has been a DREAM to design. The team at FTF
      is really so creative, patient, hard workers, and they truly make
   things happen. All of the heels are wide width and the thigh-high boots
     are wide width AND wide calf. I've always had difficulties finding
   thigh high boots that fit me right. It would always be such a let down
    when shopping. I knew if I had this problem, so many of you did too.
    Which was obvious because whenever I'd shimmy myself into a pair, I'd
    get hundreds of comments like WHERE DID YOU GET THOSE?! Sometimes I'd
   even cut a slit in the back upper thigh and then put a little string in
     the back to make it look like it was made that way. I'm a finesser.
                               What can I say?

     Everything is either shoes, or accessories, except for ONE piece of
    actual clothing. I designed a cute little long sleeve bodysuit romper
   with a draped back. It's super stretch and comfy. It goes so well will
   with all of the thigh high boots. It's perfect for a club situation, a
               dinner situation, or just to be cute situation.

   On another note: I really can't wait to hear all of your feedback. I'm
      dying for you all to get your stuff so that I can see all of your
    pictures and repost them. Nothing feels better to me, honestly, than
   seeing all of you guys feeling like you're THAT BITCH (because you are)
   while wearing my stuff. We made hair pins that say THAT BITCH and even
    the inside of my shoe boxes say REMINDER: YOU'RE THAT BITCH. I mean,
     because you are, DUH. Okay, last but not least, I just want to say
        thank you so much to FTF and thank you to all of you who have
                continuously supported me. I love you all. xx

On The Move

   I've been on the move this Fashion Week. Can you believe I've left the
    house 2 days in a row, going on 3? Who am I even? LOL. To be honest,
   this fashion week I've toned down my looks some, keeping it more simple
    and easy to move around. It could be the weather and the heat that's
   been stopping me from pulling out less simple looks. My jeans are from
    Universal Standard. I'm wearing a size 12. You can get the exact ones
     HERE! I cut a little slit in the side of each leg just because. How
   cute is this little cardigan top? It's also from US and you can get it
                                    HERE.

    I’m so honored to be a part of Universal Standard's #FashionFreedom
      campaign that truly stands by the motto of All of Us. As we are.
       Anywhere. I was always asked how I was able to be so confident,
    especially around others. My answer every time is that fashion really
   helped me build confidence. It helped me express myself and regardless
    of my size, I feel it’s incredibly important to live in the moment
   whatever journey you’re on. This subway campaign really embodies that
    and I’m truly grateful. US is a brand that has changed the fashion
     industry with their size range 00-40, but they also have something
    called Fit Liberty. I first learned about it when I went to their NY
    office 2 years back. Anything you purchase is eligible for a one-year
   size exchange. Coming from someone who fluctuates in sizes quite often,
                       it’s extremely life-changing.

Pink Mini Dress

   I got this pink mini dress from Femme Luxe. A few posts back I wore the
    same dress in black. Am I the only one that when they find a piece of
   clothing they truly love, they purchase it in all the colors available?
   On their site they also have this exact dress in white and red. I'm on
                 the verge of getting the red one too. 😭

   On a side note, NYFW is here so I'm throwing this post up before things
   get hectic on my end. This Fashion Week I decided I'm only going to 5-
   or 6 events. I'm tired of overwhelming myself and over the years, I've
    learned I don't have to say yes to everything or everyone. I laughed
    when I saw on Instagram someone post a meme saying "September is the
       January of Fashion." It's lowkey true. But more importantly, my
     birthday is 10 days away and the older I get, the less excited I am
                               about it. LMAO.

Burgundy Wrap Dress

   "The direction of your focus is the direction your life will move. Let
    yourself move toward what is good, valuable, strong and true." -Ralph
                                   Marston

     This week I've been in full work mode and I"m actually excited and
   inspired for the first time in a minute. I have a big photoshoot coming
    up this Wednesday and I can't wait until you guys see it on September
    20th. Keep an eye out for it! On a side note, wrap dresses are always
   my go-to especially for the Summer. They're just so easy to wear, they
    look beautiful, and it feels like I'm not wearing anything but a moo
    moo dress. lol. I can't stop listening to Megan Thee Stallion. Thank
       God for her because I have some cocky lyrics to use again on my
    Instagram captions. My dress is from ASOS last Summer and they don't
    have the exact one anymore so I put some similar ones below. My heels
    are vintage from Sergio Rossi that I bought from The Real Real. I put
           similar strap heels below as well! xx nadia wrap dress
