   SolydXK is a Debian-based desktop distribution which is available in
   two main editions: Xfce and KDE Plasma. The project's latest release
   builds on technology from Debian Buster and fixes a number of bugs.
   "The SolydXK Team has worked long and hard to create yet another solid
   release. We are proud to announce SolydXK 10 based on Debian Buster!
   Highlights: Based on Debian Buster 10.1 release with the latest kernel
   version 4.19. Live ISO can now be booted with localisation support. New
   GRUB2 theme. The USB Creator was rebuilt from scratch to improve
   stability, speed and maintainability. Many bugs were resolved and we
   changed the SolydXK Firefox settings even further to improve user
   privacy. This is done in the firefox-solydxk-adjustments package which
   can be purged if you don't need it. We thouroughly cleaned up the ISOs
   removing any packages that are not strictly needed without compromising
   system stability and safety." The Raspberry Pi 3 image has been dropped

   Univention Corporate Server (UCS) is an enterprise-class distribution
   based on Debian GNU/Linux. The project's latest release is an update to
   the distribution's 4.4 series: 4.4-2. "We've just published the second
   point release for UCS 4.4. Apart from some bug fixes and corrections,
   we've also implemented some new features and, of course, we've put some
   work into numerous apps. Final Version of the UDM REST API: Looking
   back at the first point release (UCS 4.4-1 in June 2019), our REST API
   for the Univention Directory Manager was still in beta stadium. Good
   news: the interface for accessing the directory service is stable now.
   The API connects applications to the UCS directory service; access is
   granted via a web service using HTTPS, and data is exchanged JSON
   format. So, the REST API offers the same functionality as the udm
   command line tool. For example, it simplifies the maintenance of user
   properties or computer objects from connected systems. Developers of
   applications offered in the Univention App Center also benefit from the
   new, standardized access because they are no longer limited to the UDM
   Python interface." Additional information can be found in the
   distribution's release announcement. Download: UCS_4.4-2-amd64.iso

   The CentOS project, a 100% compatible rebuild of the Red Hat Enterprise
   Linux, in full compliance with Red Hat's redistribution requirements,
   has published a new version: CentOS 8.0.1905. The new version is based
   on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.0 sources. There are two main editions of
   CentOS, depending on your needs, CentOS Linux and CentOS Steam: "You
   now have two ways to consume the CentOS platform, CentOS Linux and
   CentOS Stream. CentOS Linux is a rebuild of the freely available
   sources for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). CentOS Stream is a
   midstream distribution that provides a cleared-path for participation
   in creating the next version of RHEL. Read more in the CentOS Stream
   release notes." CentOS Stream is a rolling release distribution that
   acts as a middle ground between the cutting edge packages in Fedora and
   the stable, long-term packages available in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
   Both editions of CentOS are available in off-line and net-install
   (boot) editions. Additional information can be found in the release
   announcement and in the release notes (CentOS Linux and CentOS Stream).

   Rate this project André Silva has announced the release of Hyperbola
   GNU/Linux-libre 0.3, a major update of the project's Arch-based, free
   (as in freedom) Linux distribution that meets the GNU Free System
   Distribution Guidelines (GNU FSDG). This version introduces Xenocara as
   the default X window display server: "After several months of
   development, we are happy to announce a new release of Hyperbola
   GNU/Linux-libre. This is a major milestone and we have fixed many bugs,
   so that this release is now stable. It includes Xenocara as the default
   display server for the X Window System and LibreSSL as the default
   provider of SSL and TLS protocols. Additionally, all packages adhere to
   the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard. Since it is a major change, there is
   a migration guide available for users that come from Milky Way 0.2. It
   is no longer recommended to migrate from any Arch-based distro, but
   users who wish to try should make adequate backups may refer to the
   Arch Migration article on our wiki." See the release announcement for
   more information. The project provides a dual-architecture
   (i686/x86_64) installation and rescue image (text mode only) similar to
   Arch Linux to install the system. Download link:

   Colin Finck has announced the release of ReactOS 0.4.12, a new version
   of the project's open-source, built-from-scratch operating system
   intended to be binary-compatible with computer programs and device
   drivers made for Microsoft Windows. The new version delivers various
   usability improvements, including window snapping and better font
   rendering, as well as support for the Intel e1000 NIC driver: "The
   ReactOS team is pleased to announce the release of version 0.4.12. As
   always, a multitude of improvements have been made to all parts of the
   OS, though userland components saw special emphasis this time around.
   Filesystem drivers require a great deal of support to function
   correctly, and there is arguably no truer test of ReactOS' FS
   infrastructure than being able to run Microsoft's own FS drivers. While
   the project is not quite there yet, driving towards this goal saw
   considerable improvements been made. Pierre Schweitzer and Thomas Faber
   paid particular attention to the common cache, a module with deep ties
   to the memory manager and which traditionally has been a very
   troublesome component." Read the rest of the release announcement for

   that use wear-leveling algorithms. The sh(1) utility has been updated
   to include a new pipefail option, which when set, changes the exit
   status of a pipeline to the last non-zero exit status of any command in
   the pipeline. The mlx5tool(8) utility has been updated to implement
   firmware update capability for ConnectX-4, ConnectX-5 and ConnectX-6.
   The posixshmcontrol(1) utility has been added. The swapon(8) utility
   has been updated to invoke BIO_DELETE to trim swap devices if either

   Lakka is a lightweight Linux distribution that transforms a small
   computer into a full blown game console. The distribution is based on
   LibreELEC and runs the RetroArch console emulator. The project has
   published a new version, Lakka 2.3.1, which supports running on the
   Raspberry Pi 4 computer as well as the ROCKPro64 board. Perhaps the
   most impressive new feature is real-time translation of text: "One of
   the flagship features of RetroArch 1.7.8 is the AI Project. This unique
   and never-seen before feature allows you to translate your games on the
   fly, in real-time as you play. Once setup on your Lakka box, you will
   be able to press the AI hotkey to have the system scan the screen for
   any foreign language text. Once recognized, the text is translated and
   restitued back to you depending on the current mode: Speech mode: the
   translated text is read back to you using text to speech. As the game
   isn't interrupted in this mode, that allows you to have the game
   dialogues read to you in your language as if someone was sitting next
   to you, translating the game in real time. Image mode (on the picture):
   the original text is replaced by the translated text onscreen, while
   the game is paused to give you time to read." Further details on the
   new version can be found in the release announcement. Download:

   going to be pre-installed, but a good set of tools in our repository
   enables pen-testers to build up the perfect pen-test system for their
   specific needs, regardless the default package selection picked by our
   team. In Parrot 4.7 the sandbox is disabled by default and users can
   decide wether to start an application sandboxed or not. You can easily
   start the sandboxed variant of an installed program from the /sandbox/
   folder or from a dedicated menu that we plan to improve in the future."

   3CX Phone System
   [3cx-small.png] 3CX Phone System is a specialist, Debian-based Linux
   distribution designed to run a complete unified communications
   platform. The 3CX client, included in the distribution, can also be
   installed separately on most hardware as well as the cloud. It provides
   a complete open standards-based IP PBX and phone system that works with
   popular SIP trunks and IP phones. It will automatically configure all
   supported peripherals and it also comes with clients for Windows, OS X,
   iOS and Android. The ISO image includes a free license for the 3CX PBX
   edition. The ISO image contains the standard Debian installer which
   installs a minimal system with the nginx web server, PostgreSQL
   database, iptables firewall and Secure Shell. Options not relevant to
   3CX have been removed from the distribution. Download the installation
   ISO image from here: debian-amd64-netinst-3cx.iso (372MB).
