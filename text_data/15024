   One of my favorite ways to torture my travel buddies is by making them
   walk around a botanical garden early in the morning (i.e. the second it
   opens) listening to me sing songs about the flowers. . If you’re into
   that also, or even if you’re not, the @grugapark in @visit.essen is
   wonderful! . #germanytourism #travelscenicgermany @germanytourism One

   Every time we go to New Mexico I come home wondering why I don’t visit
   more often. It was such a wonderful five days in Santa Fe celebrating
   my sweet grandma and catching up with our amazing family. I miss you
   all so much already!! ❤️❤️❤️ Thanks @lsult for capturing so many great
   pics! Every time we go to New Mexico I come home wondering why I don’t

   It’s been a hectic couple of weeks and I am SO EXCITED to be heading to
   Santa Fe tomorrow to see all 800 family members on my dad’s side and
   not reply to a single work email. A lot more from my Germany and Paris
   trip coming to the feed eventually, too! 🥰 It’s been a hectic couple of

   While exploring Germany with @germanytourism I fell in LOVE with the
   Margarethenhöhe area of Essen. We had visited one morning briefly and
   by nighttime I was already dying to go back. So I searched for dinner
   options in the area, landing upon this one, and I’m so glad I did! .
   The terrace is framed with tall hedges (kind of like a maze) so that
   your table is hidden from the other guests. Maybe it’s because I hadn’t
   slept the night before, or because we had been running around all day
   nonstop and I was relieved to be taking a break from driving, but there
   was something extra magical about it to me. . We sat in the sunshine
   both facing the cute German exterior, drinking chilled wine, eating
   German food, and watching the sun go down. Every time I come across
   photos of it while working on my blog posts they make me smile, and so
   I’m sharing them with you ✨ (Swipe to the video - that will give you a
   better idea!) While exploring Germany with @germanytourism I fell in
