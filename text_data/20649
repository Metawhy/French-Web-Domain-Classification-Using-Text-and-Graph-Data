Details to Notice: Kid-Friendly Spaces

   Oct32019

   Of all the pretty things I see online, it’s funny that this picture of
   a scribbled-on kids’ table made me really stop. My first thought was
   “how sweet.” My second thought was “but I’d be ticked if this happened
   in my house.” Why is that? There’s something about not being right in
   the middle of the situation that makes you appreciate it. Why can our
   homes not look like kids live there? Trying to tuck their stuff away
   all of the time, after all, is a losing battle. I looked up the rest of
   Reath Designs’ work, and it looks like they fully embrace the idea of
   displaying all of the messy sweetness that comes with kids. Nothing is
   too staged or too fussy. Most of the photos look like real families
   have just stepped out of the rooms.

     * Embrace the scribbles! One day, I’m sure these will be less of an
       annoyance and more of a treasure.
     * Why not put a kids’ table and chairs in the middle of a living
       area? (And, the colorful chairs are a fun touch.)
     * Scattered cushions in pretty fabrics are a comfy option–and we all
       know most cushions end up on the floor anyway. . .

     * When the playroom isn’t tucked away somewhere, I like the idea of
       using a more grown up wallpaper as a backdrop.
     * Fun with color! Painting the piano to match the walls is a pretty
       bold move.
     * Incorporate their toys into your decor. The cowboy hat hanging on
       the art is a sweet touch.

     * Mix their art in with pieces you already own for an eclectic
       gallery wall.
     * Not every piece of kids’ art has to be framed to be displayed.
       There’s something about the chaos of colorful paintings taped up
       around the kitchen that I really like.

     * Vintage (inspired) posters are a great go-to for color and whimsy.
       You can find them online in almost any size and in any color
       scheme.
     * Check out that super simple window covering.

     * Cork around a kids’ doorway becomes a fun bulletin board and
       display area.
     * What do you all think of giving you kids painter’s tape and letting
       them go? No headboard needed.

     * Flags provide such a big, bold statement around the perimeter of
       the room. (I used flags on a much smaller scale in my son’s room.)
     * I love the mix of traditional wallpaper and poster beds as a
       backdrop for the toys and flags.
     * Create little lounging and reading areas with smaller, layered
       rugs.

An Easy Game Day Set Up

   Sep302019

   This post is sponsored by Walmart.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I like just about everything about football–except for football. I like
   the way it sounds when it’s on tv in my house, the way it makes it feel
   like Fall (even if it’s still 95 degrees outside), the sound of
   marching bands and most of all, the social part–which usually includes
   food. I’m teaming up with Walmart again this month to create an easy
   game day set up with just a few serving pieces and ready-made snacks
   you can grab with the rest of your groceries.

   Walmart-game-day-set-up

   I’m all about quick and easy gatherings. I set this up on our back
   porch using a grass table runner, simple white platters and cute
   football themed plates and napkins I ordered online from Walmart. (I
   also tried out their ship-to-store option for the first time and it was
   a great experience. Instead of going to customer service, I went
   straight to the new pick up area near the front of the store, checked
   in at a kiosk and a Walmart employee bought my order right out.)

   football-plates-napkins-walmart
   game-day-ready-with-Walmart-football-party

   cookies-white-platter-game-day

   The easiest part of this set up is that I was able to pick up all of
   the food in the same stop at great prices. I bought ready-made subs,
   cupcakes and cookies from Walmart’s deli and bakery, put them on pretty
   platters and we’re ready to go. At this rate, I *may* even get crazy
   and host a Super Bowl party. . .

   Sharing a few more finds for setting up an easy spread below:

The Saturday 6

   Sep282019

   lake-home-Bria-Hammel ONE.  A beautiful lake home reveal.


   colorful-home-tour TWO.  This is a fun–and colorful–home tour.


   Mel Bean Interiors THREE.  And more inspiring photos in the portfolio
   of the team who designed the previous home.


   Tudor home tour FOUR.  A cozy Tudor home tour.


   Jenna-Sue-Design-Co-kitchen-renovation FIVE.  A kitchen renovation with

   Amazon-store SIX.  And finally, just a quick note to let you know I now
   have an Amazon storefront where I’ll be organizing all of my Amazon
   finds by category, hopefully making it easier to find the things I
   recommend here. If there are other categories you’d like to see, let me
   know. I’m still working on it and will be continuously updating.
   (Currently, you can only access Amazon stores through the direct
   link within the app. I’ve also linked it in the main menu under my blog
   header.)
