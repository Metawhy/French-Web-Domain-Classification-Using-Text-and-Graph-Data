October: Your Truth Will Be Tested This Month [Video]

   October 3, 2019October 2, 2019 ~ admin ~ Leave a comment

   October 2019 Nicole Frolick – Throughout the month of October, we will
   experience a surge in ascension energies that will be forcing us to not
   only confront our truth, but ask us, ‘How well do you know your truth?’
   and ‘Are you confident to stand in it without being polarized out of
   your certainty?’

   A couple of weeks ago, I was guided to release a post on Collapsing
   Duality. In this video, I received a message that this topic would be
   coming up in the AlcheME discussion for October. Continue reading

The Main Theme For October Is “Rewriting The Story”

   October 3, 2019October 2, 2019 ~ admin ~ Leave a comment

   change Lena Stevens – Do you love every aspect of your life? Do you
   love what is happening in the world, on our planet, with your friends
   and loved ones? Do you wake up every day and feel that everything is
   perfect and right and you would not have it any other way?

   If you answered yes, you are a rarity, as most of us have aspects of
   our lives that could be much improved and there are parts of our
   personal story and what we see happening in the world that we would
   give anything to change.

   This month we have the opportunity to shift the cycle of feeling
   victimized and imprisoned by our story and to put into action our
   dreams for a better future. This is not going to happen passively.

Commerce Has Been Polluted

   October 3, 2019October 2, 2019 ~ admin ~ Leave a comment

   commerce Paul Rosenberg – I am a long-time advocate of free markets.
   Voluntary commerce is more or less the only moral way for humans to
   cooperate on a large scale; everything else involves coercion. And as a
   bonus, free markets work better than anything else.

   That does not, however, mean that free markets deliver perfection, or
   that private businesses can’t be criminal. Private businesses can be
   abominable, and sometimes are. Understand this, please:

   Markets are neutral structures. The only morality they have is the
   morality we bring to them. Continue reading “Commerce Has Been

General McInerney: The Deep State Unraveling [Video]

   October 3, 2019October 2, 2019 ~ admin ~ Leave a comment

   whistleblower Alexandra Bruce – US Air Force General Tom McInerney
   joins Dr Dave Janda to discuss the latest impeachment hijinks. He asks,
   “Why are they doing all these bizarre things that we’ve never seen in
   the history of this great nation, Dave?

   “They are doing it for one reason: they have got to cover up the most
   corrupt administration in the history of the United States, the Obama
   Administration…

   “They also had to cover up Uranium One, they had to cover up the IRS
   scandal, they had to cover up Fast and Furious with the Department of
   Justice and Holder – so, there are a whole host of things that they are
   trying to cover up… Continue reading “General McInerney: The Deep State

Trump: “We’re At War, These People Are Sick”

   October 3, 2019October 2, 2019 ~ admin ~ Leave a comment

   Trump Paul Joseph Watson – President Trump has accused Democrats of
   conducting a “coup” to remove him from office, commenting, “We’re at
   war, these people are sick.”

   “As I learn more and more each day, I am coming to the conclusion that
   what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP, intended to
   take away the Power of the People, their VOTE, their Freedoms, their
   Second Amendment, Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their God-given
   rights as a Citizen of The United States of America!” tweeted Trump.

     ….People, their VOTE, their Freedoms, their Second Amendment,
     Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their God-given rights as a
     Citizen of The United States of America!

     — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2019

How A Blocked Root Chakra Impacts You

   October 2, 2019October 1, 2019 ~ admin ~ Leave a comment

   Sylvia Landa – Chakra is a Sanskrit word meaning wheel. Chakras are
   spinning circular energy centers in the body. There are seven main
   chakras which are aligned vertically along the spinal cord.

   The first chakra is the root chakra, also known as the base chakra and
   muladhara. Muladhara is a Sanskrit word meaning foundation. The root
   chakra is located at the base of the spine just above the perineum. The
   color associated with the root chakra is red.

   Earth tones like black and brown are also associated with the root
   chakra. The root chakra rules our foundation in life. The Earth, our
   family, our “roots”. This energy center rules survival and our primal
   animalistic fight or flight instincts. The physical body, our shelter,
   tribe, basic needs and material wealth are also ruled by the root
   chakra. Continue reading “How A Blocked Root Chakra Impacts You” →

Magnesium Deficiency: Top Solutions, Causes, & Signs

   October 2, 2019October 1, 2019 ~ admin ~ Leave a comment

   magnesium Dr. Edward Group – Most health-conscious people have heard of
   magnesium (Mg), but many of them don’t know a whole lot about it.
   Compared to other vitamins and minerals, it tends to fly under the
   radar. But, it’s a vital nutrient that’s essential for good health.

   You may remember magnesium from the periodic table of scientific
   elements that was posted in your middle school science classroom. It
   plays a critical role in metabolism, and the body uses it for more than
   300 biochemical reactions. Those processes support your immune system,
   promote a healthy nervous system and brain, maintain cardiovascular
   health, and build strong muscles and bones. Continue reading “Magnesium

FDA: Over 6,000 Dead from Puberty Blocking Drug for Transgender Children

   October 2, 2019September 30, 2019 ~ admin ~ Leave a comment

   Gender dysphoria Kelen McBreen – Parents of kids with gender dysphoria
   not warned about dangers of hormone blockers

   A drug used to block puberty in children with gender dysphoria is
   responsible for the death of over 6,300 people, according to the Food &
   Drug Administration (FDA).

   The Christian Post reports Leuprolide Acetate (Lupron) “is being
   prescribed off-label for use in children who have been diagnosed with
   gender dysphoria despite the lack of formal FDA approval for that
   purpose.”

   “The drug is clinically approved for treatment of precocious puberty, a
   condition where children start their pubertal processes at an
   abnormally early age and the blocker is administered for a short time
   until the proper age,” the outlet continues. Continue reading “FDA:

Germany: 40% of Welfare Recipients Are Foreigners, Despite Being in Minority

   October 2, 2019October 1, 2019 ~ admin ~ Leave a comment

   Arthur Lyons – At least 40 percent of all welfare recipients in German
   are foreigners, costing German taxpayers more than 4 billion euros
   every month to pay for the food, education, medicine, and shelter of
   2.7 million non-contributing foreigners living in the country, new
   official reports have revealed.

   According to new figures released by Germany’s Federal Employment
   Agency, three out of four working-age Syrians living in Germany are
   supported entirely or partially by the country’s welfare system, Hartz
   IV, Die Welt reports.

   As of June 2018, the official unemployment rate for Syrians in Germany
   was 44.2 percent, slightly down from last year’s figure of 49.6
   percent. However, as the report points out, the figure isn’t exactly
   truthful because Syrian migrants who attend state-funded ‘integration
   courses’ or ‘vocational language courses’ are not regarded as
   unemployed, but instead as ‘underemployed persons.’ Continue reading

Coup d’état by way of an ‘Pseudo Impeachment’

   October 2, 2019October 1, 2019 ~ admin ~ Leave a comment

   Sartre – When the legacy of the doomed American Republic is compiled,
   the treason of the Deep State will be known as an imperial operative
   against the citizens of what was once a great nation. The latest
   desperate betrayal by the Democrat Congress to proclaim separate
   committee investigations into accusations against President Trump is no
   formal impeachment. Without a vote by the entire House, the hype is
   pure political street theater.

   Trump Notwithstanding, with Pelosi’s compliance with the demented
   progressive squad, the virtual silence in the defense of Trump by the
   RINO Republicans is so deafening that you would not know that there is
   any difference among careerist politicians. Add into the mix the
   bureaucrats, technocrats and the revolving door opportunists, has a net
   result of globalists traitors serving the commands of the Shadow
   Corporatist dictates. Continue reading “Coup d’état by way of an
   ‘Pseudo Impeachment’” →

Why Antibodies and Recombinant Protein Research Can Be Vital

   October 2, 2019October 2, 2019 ~ admin ~ Leave a comment

   Over the past few decades, biotechnology has become increasingly more
   prominent. This has led to quite a significant number of advances in
   several areas, with health and medicine being some of the most notable.
   Recombinant protein

   While this has been spread among each of the treatment stages, it’s
   especially true with early discovery research products and devices.
   Much of this has been done in recent years, with firms such as Leinco
   Technologies and others releasing various products. With this, there
   have been a few primary beneficiaries, such as recombinant protein and
   antibodies.

   Though the second of these terms may be familiar to some people, many
   of us may not know much about either of these areas. As a result of
   this, a significant number of us might not realize how important they
   can be for our health. Continue reading “Why Antibodies and Recombinant
   Protein Research Can Be Vital” →

Message for October 2019

   October 1, 2019September 30, 2019 ~ admin ~ Leave a comment

   October Lee-Anne Peters – I trust you’re still standing at the end of
   September after a very wild and life changing month. If you’re not
   standing now, sending you lots of LOVE and strength, and I trust before
   too long you’ll be back on your feet.

   September was a game changer for many of us. We pushed through (and are
   still experiencing) big life tests as we enter into one of the very few
   Grand Life Doors we face during our whole lifetime. This is the doorway
   which leads into something new, true and adventurous. We are not only
   starting a new chapter – but a new book. These big times, stir up big
   things, so many of us battered and dragged our way through. As the
   month ends many of us are entering into our new doors, and into a new
   reality for ourselves.

   I’ve laid out some cards for October – so let’s see. Remember this is a
   guide only. Continue reading “Message for October 2019” →

Pets Are Now as Unaffordable As College, Housing and Healthcare

   October 1, 2019September 30, 2019 ~ admin ~ Leave a comment

   pet Charles Hugh Smith – One of the few joys still available to the
   average household is a pet. At least this is what I thought until I
   read 5 money-saving tips people hate, which included the lifetime costs
   of caring for a pet.

   It turns out Poochie and Kittie are as unaffordable as college, housing
   and healthcare (and pretty much everything else). Over the course of 15
   years, small-dog Poochie will set the owner back an eye-watering
   $17,560 to $93,520, while big-dog Fido costs $22,025 to $82,929 over 12
   years.

   Kittie is a relative bargain at $16,800 over 15 years.

   Some estimates of responsible pet ownership are considerably lower, but
   non-pet owners may be surprised by 1) how many options for the care of
   pets are now available and 2) how many medical interventions and
   treatments are now available, at prices that aren’t much different from
   human healthcare.

   Five-figure bills for pet surgeries and other care are not uncommon.

So Sorry, Your Karma Ran Over Your Dogma

   October 1, 2019September 30, 2019 ~ admin ~ Leave a comment

   karma Charles Hugh Smith – Karma covers a lot of ground, but it boils
   down to consequences: consequences not just from your actions but from
   your convictions, schemes, obsessions, and yes, dogmas.

   The reason why Karma runs over Dogma is that nobody clinging to a dogma
   sees themselves as dogmatic. The true believer never sees their
   conviction as dogma, but as Revealed Truth, as self-evident, a view
   that is buttressed by all the other True Believers who surround the
   believer, reinforcing their conviction and soothing any nagging doubts
   by mocking, “debunking” or marginalizing heretics and critics.

   In our society, the mass media serves as a soothing echo-chamber of
   dogmas. It must be true, the news anchor said it on TV, etc. Continue
