      Exhibition: AfriCOBRA: Nation Time

     * May 11, 2019 – November 24, 2019
     * Ca’ Faccanon

   AfriCOBRA: Nation Time celebrates the founding of AfriCOBRA, the Black
   artist collective that helped define the visual style of the Black Arts
   Movements of the 1960s and 70s.

   AfriCOBRA (which stands for the African Commune of Bad Relevant
   Artists) was founded in 1968 by Chicago-based artists Jeff Donaldson,
   Jae Jarrell, Wadsworth Jarrell, Barbara Jones-Hogu, and Gerald
   Williams, each of whom used their work to present uplifting portraits
   of African Americans. The founders, like many activists of the 1960s
   and 1970s, understood that their artistic voices could contribute to
   the liberation and unification of the Black community as a whole.

   The project grew out of an exhibition first presented at the Museum of
   Contemporary Art (MOCA) North Miami from November 27, 2018–March 24,
   2019, honoring of the collective’s fiftieth anniversary. It brings
   together works by the founding artists with additional works by five
   early members—including Sherman Beck, Napoleon Jones-Henderson, Omar
   Lama, Carolyn Lawrence and Nelson Stevens—to look back at their early
   contributions, the evolution of AfriCOBRA, and the artists’
   contemporary work.

   AfriCOBRA: Nation Time, organized by MOCA North Miami and curated by
   Jeffreen M. Hayes (Executive Director of Threewalls in Chicago), is on
   view at Ca’ Faccanon in Venice, Italy, as part of the 2019 Venice
   Biennale’s program of Collateral Events.

   The exhibition is presented as part of Art Design Chicago. For more

     * August 3, 2019 – December 1, 2019

   From the Terra Foundation Collection, Three Boys on the Shore by
   Winslow Homer is exhibited at the Cape Ann Museum.  The exhibition

      Exhibition: David Smith: Sculpture 1932–1965

     * June 22, 2019 – January 5, 2020
     * Yorkshire Sculpture Park

   This exhibition will present the work of David Smith (1906–1965)
   through sculptures drawn from four decades, beginning with Smith’s
   earliest experimental works from the 1930s and ending with his
   large-scale sculptures of the 1960s, along with a selection of
   drawings. A key figure in the history of 20th century sculpture, Smith
   was the first known American artist to work with welded metal. In
   addition to exploring Smith’s distinctive working of metal, the
   exhibition will demonstrate his unique fusion of industry and nature
   and will place a selection of his sculptures in the Yorkshire
   landscape.

      Exhibition: Nancy Spero

     * September 22, 2019 – January 5, 2020
     * Nordic Watercolor Museum

   Organized by Museum Folkwang, this retrospective of Nancy Spero
   (1926–2009) considers the artist’s use of the human figure to raise
   important questions about feminism, gender, and violence. The
   exhibition traces Spero’s career, starting with the Paris Black
   Paintings of the 1960s through her artistic responses to the Vietnam
   War and her mature work in 1990s and early 2000s. Throughout her
   career, Spero saw herself as a political artist that used art as a
   vehicle to engage with social and political issues. In order to capture
   the scale and scope of Spero’s oeuvre, the exhibition features
   approximately eighty works, including paintings, collages, and prints,
   and focuses in particular on her works on paper.

      Exhibition: The Making of Husbands: Christina Ramberg in Dialogue

     * September 13, 2019 – January 5, 2020
     * KW Institute for Contemporary Art

   This exhibition presents the work of artist and educator Christina
   Ramberg (1946–1995) in the first substantial monographic presentation
   of her paintings outside of the United States. Associated with the
   Chicago Imagists, Ramberg produced a body of comical, formally elegant,
   and erotically sinister paintings. The exhibition focuses in particular
   on a selection of Ramberg’s iconic torsi paintings from 1974–1981, a
   group of tightly cropped, crisply delineated pictures of female torsos
   bound by varieties of corsets and lingerie. Following Ramberg’s work,
   the exhibition explores the constructs that structure and shape
   people’s bodies, movements, minds, and expressions and the impact they
   have on identity development. To that end, the exhibition also includes
   a presentation of a few select artists to elaborate on the themes of
   Ramberg’s oeuvre.

      Exhibition: What Came After: Figurative Painting in Chicago 1978–1998

     * September 14, 2019 – January 12, 2020
     * Elmhurst Art Museum

   As a follow-up to the exhibition The Figure and the Chicago Imagists,
   which explored the highly original expressions of the human form
   created by a group of Chicago-based artists in the 1960s and 70s, the
   Elmhurst Art Museum now presents What Came After: Figurative Painting
   in Chicago 1978-1998.

   After the rise of Imagism, many Chicago-based artists struggled with
   understanding and processing the term since it was first used in the
   early 1970s, including those that either built on the ideas of their
   peers or those who sought to break free from expectations of the
   Imagist legacy. What Came After better defines and celebrates this
   later generation of artists, often labelled third-generation Imagists,
   Post-Imagists, and/or the “Chicago School.”

   Organized by artist and curator Phyllis Bramson, What Came After
   features 30 paintings by artists including Michiko Itatani, Paul
   Lamantia, Robert Lostutter, and many more.

   Funding for exhibition programming is supported by the Terra Foundation
   for American Art. For more information,

      Collection Loan: Marsden Hartley

     * September 19, 2019 – January 19, 2020
     * Louisiana Museum of Modern Art (Humlebaek, Denmark)

   From the collection of the Terra Foundation for American Art, Painting
   No. 50 by Marsden Hartley is exhibited in Marsden Hartley, a
   retrospective of the artist’s work in many forms, with painting
   exhibited alongside his work as a poet and essayist.  This exhibition
   will be on view at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humlebaek,
   Denmark, September 19, 2019-January 19, 2020

   (119.4 x 119.4 cm), Terra Foundation for American Art, Daniel J. Terra
   Collection, 1999.61

      Exhibition: Marsden Hartley

     * September 19, 2019 – January 19, 2020
     * Louisiana Museum of Modern Art (Humlebaek, Denmark)

   This exhibition pays particular attention to Marsden Hartley’s works
   that have often been overlooked or lesser studied. Ultimately the
   exhibition frames these paintings, works on paper, and poetry not as
   “dead ends,” but rather as paths that led Hartley to his most iconic
   work. As a supplement to the exhibition, there are filmed interviews
   with living artists who discuss Hartley’s legacy.

      Exhibition: Peter Saul: Pop, Funk, Bad Painting and More

     * September 20, 2019 – January 26, 2020
     * les Abattoirs, Musée - Frac Occitanie Toulouse

   Consistently attentive to the chaos of the world, Peter Saul has
   engaged with some of the most sensitive issues of the 20th and 21st
   centuries. Covering his career since the late 1950s to the present day,
   the exhibition brings together more than 70 paintings, many previously
   unseen, as well as a collection of archival material. Despite the fact
   that Saul’s work reflects major movements of the 20th century,
   including Pop, Funk, and Bad Painting, the artist resists such
   categorizations of his work. Instead, Saul’s defiant style established
   a new form of historical painting that revolted against standards and
   served as a model for a generation of painters.

      Exhibition: Modern by Design: Chicago Streamlines America

     * October 27, 2018 – March 1, 2020
     * Chicago History Museum (Chicago, Illinois)

   Modern by Design: Chicago Streamlines America reveals how Chicago
   brought cutting-edge modern design to the American marketplace on a
   scale unmatched by any other city. The exhibition focuses on 1930s–50s,
   a critical period in American history. It presents issues of design and
   aesthetics within the larger social, economic and cultural context of
   the time and explores how the city’s hosting of the 1933-34 World’s
   Fair, its industries, advertising firms and mail order companies
   advanced modern design on local, regional and national levels.
   Innovative designs coupled with the might of Chicago’s manufacturing
   and distribution infrastructure led to the mass production of
   affordable state-of-the-art products featuring a new urban-inspired
   aesthetic that furnished public and private spaces across the country.

   The exhibition includes more than 200 objects, photographs and
   documents, many on view for the first time. The works of many
   celebrated designers, such as Alfonso Iannelli, Otis Shephard and
   Wolfgang Hoffmann will be featured. Modern by Design: Chicago
   Streamlines America is curated by Olivia Mahoney, senior curator at the
   Chicago History Museum.

   This exhibition is presented as part of Art Design Chicago. For more

      Exhibition: Eternal Light: The Sacred Stained-Glass of Louis Comfort
      Tiffany

     * September 7, 2019 – March 8, 2020
     * The Richard H. Driehaus Museum

   This exhibition examines ecclesiastical windows created by Louis
   Comfort Tiffany and his workshops between 1880 and 1920. Commissioned
   by churches across the United States, these works—varying from intimate
   portraits to monumental triptychs—feature imagery drawn from the
   Christian religious tradition, illustrated in figurative styles
   contemporary to the time. In addition to the ecclesiastical windows,
   the exhibition presents associated objects and ephemera that relate
   Tiffany’s marketing practices to his artistic innovations.

Chicago

   Since our origins in 1978, the Terra Foundation has had a special
   connection with Chicago. Today, we are headquartered in the same
   historic Michigan Avenue building that once housed the Terra Museum of
   American Art, and our affinity for the city is reflected in many ways,
   including:
     * Chicago Public Program and K–12 Education grants,
     * Support for exhibitions at Chicago institutions,
     * Support for lectures, symposia, and other academic programs in
       Chicago,
     * Support for the Art Design Chicago initiative, and
     * The Terra Foundation Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago
       (see below).

Chicago Public Program Grants

   The aim of Terra Foundation Chicago Public Program Grants is to
   increase the understanding and appreciation of historical American art
   (circa 1500–1980) among general audiences. To achieve these goals, the
   foundation supports a variety of informal learning opportunities
   designed to make American art accessible and relevant to Chicago
   residents. The foundation welcomes proposals from a wide range of
   organizations, including those that may not typically have an American
   art focus. Learn more

Chicago K–12 Education Grants

   The Terra Foundation supports activities that bring American art into
   Chicago’s classrooms, with the aim of helping teachers enrich curricula
   and enhance learning. To achieve these goals, the foundation funds
   projects that strengthen Chicago teachers’ knowledge of historical
   American art (circa 1500–1980) and the ability to teach with it
   effectively. Learn more

Exhibition Grants in Chicago

   In recognition of the importance of experiencing original works of art,
   the Terra Foundation for American Art supports exhibitions in Chicago,
   and around the world, that expand the understanding and appreciation of
   historical American art made between 1500 and 1980. Chicago
   institutions organizing or hosting an exhibition on any historical
   American art topic are eligible to apply for funding, which can
   potentially support costs for shipping, installation, publications, and
   related educational programs, among others. Learn more

Academic Program Grants in Chicago

   In order to stimulate study and dialogue about historical American art,
   the Terra Foundation supports academic events organized by Chicago
   institutions. Support is available for symposia, colloquia, and
   scholarly convenings. Learn more

Art Design Chicago Grants

   In response to the growing interest in local and regional art histories
   within in the American art field, the Terra Foundation for American Art
   has launched Art Design Chicago, a grant initiative focused on the rich
   history of art and design in Chicago between the Great Fire (1871) and
   the close of the twentieth century. Through the initiative, the Terra
   Foundation will offer grant support for freshly conceived exhibitions,
   academic programs, publications, and public programs designed to deepen
   and expand understanding of:
     * The visual art and design that emerged from Chicago (1871–2000);
     * Chicago’s distinctive character as an art and design center, and
       the diverse factors that have shaped Chicago’s artistic culture;
       and
     * Ways in which Chicago’s artists and designers have engaged with and
       contributed to culture nationally and internationally. Learn more

The Terra Foundation Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago

   Since April 2005, the Terra Foundation of American Art has loaned works
   for display to the Department of American Art at the Art Institute of
   Chicago (AIC). Works from the collection of the Terra Foundation and
   works from the Art Institute of Chicago are located together in a suite
   of galleries, providing one of the nation’s most comprehensive
   presentations of American art.
