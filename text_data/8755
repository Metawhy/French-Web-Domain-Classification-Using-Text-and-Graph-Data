You're Egg-stra special

   Pin It
   I am in the middle of a 4 day stretch at work. (I work 12 hour night
   shifts.) You never sleep as well or as deep when you sleep during the
   day. By the end of my days I could be dragging pretty well. Nothing a
   good NIGHTS sleep won't fix though. We truely are not meant to be
   nocturnal creatures. Tonight could be interesting trying to stay away.
   ;-) awhhh the joys of shift work.
   Time is short so today I am leaving you with this fun little word
   art....
   Now to figure something for dinner. hmmmm, any ideas?!

Hippity, Hoppity, Happy Easter

   Pin It
   We spent the weekend doing work on our house before selling it.
   Needless to say our Easter weekend was NOT all that we wanted. Still
   the boys got to enjoy some fun egg hunts with family and friends. We
   are back home hoping to relax before everyone returns to work and
   school. In the meantime I took advantage of my sweet hubby being home
   to do up some fun Easter word art. I will be posting one each day this
   week so come back, share your fun stories and pick up something fun to
   go with all your Easter pictures.

Smile- it's contagious

   Pin It
         I have an amazing friend in Idaho. She is the ultimate optimist!
   I have seen her struggle through life's challenges that would beat down
   the best of us with a smile on her face. She is forever happy. She
   thrives on life and the challenges it brings. When we had to make an
   unexpected and truthfully, unwanted move her words to me were, "what a
   GRAND adventure you will have!" I struggled with the move that took me
   away from the town, friends, and family that I hold so dear. I was so
   homesick and struggled to make our new house and town a home. If those
   words were a quilt they would be rags from all the times I have thought
   of her cheerful advice. They wrapped me in a warm embrace as I tried to
   learn from her amazing example.
        We taught cub scouts together for 5 years. Trust me, a group of 9
   year old boys can wear you down. Not Rebekah though. She could smile
   and laugh off any of the boys antics. She is wise and caring. Her
   children are amazing and strong and well behaved. I have always been in
   awe of how she can mold a child; how she can teach a child without them
   realizing they just learned. It all comes so natural. Her cup is always
   half full or more. She truly has a smile that is contagious to those
   blessed to share it! I try to remember her quick and easy laughter. It
   really does make the day lighter.

Still Discovering...

   Pin It
   My boys are growing so very fast!
   Josh is now over 6' tall. I'm tall but have to look up to him. I told
   him there have been few men in my life I've looked up too, then gave
   him a hug. Keegan is learning the joys, and frustrations, of having a
   cell phone. Tyler is discovering the ups and downs of friends. And
   Matthew is learning about increased responsibility. I love what each
   stage of development brings. Even when they were all little, I seldom
   found remorse in what we were leaving behind because of the excitement
   of what was to come. I am trading the training wheels, preschool class,
   and nap times in for dating, driving, and late nights. I love it when
   they come home jabbering away at the latest activity at school or
   wanting to go explore with friends cuz it's just not cool to stay home
   anymore. About the time I wish they were little ones wrapped in my arms
   Josh comes home with a story to tell or opens up to mom. He loves to
   hate it when mom makes him break a smile through his crusty scowl. It
   lets me know, I'm still his mommy.
   It's lives lesson I think. To see the adventure in every challenge. My
   friend, Rebekah taught me that. So today we are "Still Discovering"!
   Discovering life, love, friends, and family.
   And today....I still love it all!

A Journey in Dual Language Immersion

   Pin It
   http://www.utahgermandli.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/home-page-logo-
   german4.png
        This year we have the privilege of starting our youngest, Mr
   Matthew, in a dual language immersion (DLI) program. Our school
   district made the fantastic decision to introduce all 5 languages
   offered in the states DLI program, German, Spanish, French, Portuguese,
   and Mandarin Chinese. This is an opportunity I would not miss out on.
   Our school school was chosen for German. My sweet hubby is fluent in
   German having served an LDS mission there and although a bit rusty he
   still enjoys speaking this language and stays in touch with friends. We
   were thrilled that Matthew would be able to learn German. Our oldest,
   Josh, also entered his first year of German in high school.
        Matthew spends 50% of his school day in German and 50% in English
   classes. His German teacher speaks only German to the students. They
   learn math, German culture and various other lessons in German. After
   the holidays the students were further challenged to only speak German
   to each other as well. It's challenging to be sure but allows his brain
   to focus on understanding and deciphering German.
        Our dinner conversations have been fun with many laughs as the
   boys share new words and try to stump each other. We knew it would be
   an adventurous year when the second week of school Matthew was making
   wise cracks to Josh...in German. Yeah, little brother thought he was
   ALL THAT!
        What I find amazing is how much faster Matthew is picking up the
   language than Josh. Earlier this week dad was thrilled to have a
   conversation with Matthew in German. He needed a few cues but Matthew
   was able to share his thoughts and feelings on the topic, why he was
   too big for "Cars" underwear.
        In sharing this fun moment with Matthew's teacher, Frau Page, she
   asked why I thought it was that Matthew was surpassing his older
   brother. Both are strong students. Both have the advantage of a fluent
   parent. Both are maintaining their grades and proficiency in other
   studies but Matthew is moving toward conversation passing Josh in
   language skill. Is it because of an aptitude for language or another
   reason? The answer is clear...AGE! Matthew's 6 year old brain is still
   hard wired for language development. He has an advantage over Josh
   despite prior language challenges.
        Matthew had a significant speech delay. At 12 months he spoke 6
   words then...nothing. He stopped speaking. Life was good. Nothing out
   of the ordinary happened. No trauma or outside influences to prevent
   him from speaking. We have another son who also had a speech delay so
   we set to work using the skills and tools we had learned from Keegan's
   speech therapy to help Matthew. It took a year and weekly speech
   therapy before Matthew repeated an easy word he previously knew, bye. I
   was in tears to hear my little boys voice break through again. We heard
   all the usual reasons why he wouldn't or couldn't speak but none of
   them fit. Our speech therapist was stumped. He did not know why Matthew
   was not talking. Matthew learned to communicate through sign to avoid
   frustration. It took years, but he finally took off talking and caught
   up to his peers. In fact, this is the first year he has not had speech
   therapy so it is interesting to me to see him pick up a second language
   with such ease.
        I love to hear Matthew share his latest German song, phrase, or
   just a new word. He even corrects moms pronunciation. Josh continues to
   learn as well but quizzes his little brother a little less...it's not
   so cool when little brother is no longer stumped by your "quizzes".
   Matthew is loving his DLI. He is learning to love the language,
   culture, and people. We are learning as a family as well. Next year we
   are even looking forward to having a German exchange student.
        The world is growing smaller. The internet has put the world at
   our finger tips. The opportunities my boys will have increase everyday.
   The opportunities Matthew will have by participating in and learning
   German are limitless. I am thrilled and so thankful our school has this
   opportunity. How could I NOT have my boys participate in Dual Language
   Immersion.
