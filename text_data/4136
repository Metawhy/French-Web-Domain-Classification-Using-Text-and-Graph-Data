   So — blogging will resume here soon, we’ve been pretty sunk in the
   conference but when we get back we will summarize and reflect.

   In the meantime, please check our conference twitter feed and the OCWC
   Conference wiki to get your remote fix.

   Some video is at our Google Video account, and a number of people have
   been doing their own tapings, which we’ll collect.

   But really, the twitter feed is the addictive part.
