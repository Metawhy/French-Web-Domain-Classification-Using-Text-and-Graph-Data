Which candidate should be US president in 2012?

   2012 Presidential Election
   ProCon.org has researched the US presidential candidates and their
   views on 75 issues including abortion, bailouts, education, medical
   marijuana, and taxes. Read our simple, nonpartisan, pro-con
   presentations and decide for yourself: "Which candidate should be US
   president in 2012?"

     ARCHIVED WEBSITE: No new data posted since Jan. 22, 2013. The 2012
     Election website received 1,786,030 sessions between Oct. 24, 2011,
   when the site first launched, through Election Day on Nov. 6, 2012. We
     kept it active until Jan. 22, 2013, the day after Barack Obama was
   inaugurated for his second term as President of the United States. The
    site is now archived - meaning we will no longer make any updates to
     it. The site will remain accessible on the homepage of ProCon.org.
    Thanks to all our readers, staff, and volunteers who made the project
                               such a success.

     ARCHIVED WEBSITE: No new data posted since Jan. 22, 2013. The 2012
     Election website received 1,786,030 sessions between Oct. 24, 2011,
   when the site first launched, through Election Day on Nov. 6, 2012. We
     kept it active until Jan. 22, 2013, the day after Barack Obama was
   inaugurated for his second term as President of the United States. The
    site is now archived - meaning we will no longer make any updates to
     it. The site will remain accessible on the homepage of ProCon.org.
    Thanks to all our readers, staff, and volunteers who made the project
                               such a success.
