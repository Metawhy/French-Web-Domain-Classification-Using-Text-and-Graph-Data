Presentation

   The main objective of the joint SERPICO Project-Team (INRIA Rennes -
   Bretagne Atlantique - UMR 144 CNRS Institut Curie ("Subcellular
   Structure and Cellular Dynamics" Unit is to decipher the dynamic
   coordination and organization of molecular complexes at the single cell
   level. We focus on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of membrane
   traffic involved in the biogenesis of specialized organelles in
   epidermal cells with main functions in the immune system and in skin
   pigmentation and photoprotection. The mathematical theories and
   algorithms are mainly developed to identify other molecular processes
   in fundamental biology but they have also a strong potential for
   applications in biotechnology and medicine: disease diagnosis,
   detection of genomic instabilities, deterioration of cell cycle,
   epigenetic mechanisms and cancer prevention. Multidimensional and
   multimodal light microscopy combined with GFP (Green Fluorescence
   Protein) tagging has taken a prominent role in life science research
   due to its ability to study biomolecules within the entire cell and
   particular cell compartments or domains. We plan to investigate new
   imaging techniques and processing methods, mathematical models, and
   algorithms to build an integrated imaging approach that bridges the
   resolution gaps between the molecule and the whole cell, in space and
   time. We address the following themes:
     * image superresolution/image denoising to preserve cell integrity
       (photo-toxicity versus exposure time) and image analysis in
       multidimensional microscopy
     * spatio-temporal organization modelling of molecular species and
       multiscale architectures in light and electron microscopy
     * computational simulation, modelling, dynamic comparison and
       classification of molecules trafficking at different spatial and
       temporal scales / biophysical model assimilation for dynamic
       representation in videomicroscopy and prediction in biology

   Experiments in vivo for la large class of stimuli (e.g.
   micro-patterning, SiRNA, drugs) will be conducted to confirm the
   biological hypotheses and to discern wheter the changes in expression
   have a role in the mechanisms under study.

   The SERPICO team and the UMR144 CNRS Institut Curie Unit / PICT (Cell
   and Tissue Imaging Facilities) - IBiSA) are partners of
   France-BioImaging, the distributed coordinated French infrastructure
   and electronic cellular BioImaging dedicated to innovation, training
   and transfer ("Investissement d'Avenir" / Institut Curie).
