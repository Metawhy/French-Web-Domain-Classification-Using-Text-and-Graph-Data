   In the upholding and expansion of a tradition that has meant building
   automobiles for a good 110 years now, Buick has teamed up with BASF in
   applying the new ideas of young innovative minds at Detroit’s famed
   design school, the College of Creative Studies. After wrestling with
   concepts introduced by the competition such as population issues in
   urban areas and developing countries, nanotechnology and the
   application of new materials in vehicle technology, students competed
   for a total of $7,000 in awards. Judged by a jury of pro designers and
   car-tech experts, the students were recognized for the likes of most
   original concept, best interior/exterior, best integration of new
   materials, with best concept overall going to Namsuk Lee, a student
   from Seoul, Korea (who also took home best interior). Other
   mentionables in the competition include Justin Salmon from Florida who
   won a grand for his his innovative use of materials, which applied
   exposed algae in the vehicle structure to usable energy. Props also go
   to Sam Kenny from North Carolina, whose elegant design got him $1,500
   for best exterior. The competition allowed these students access to the
   same data used by industry professionals, giving them a great
   opportunity and learning experience in a competitive field, plus, of
   course, cash money. Source

   Modeled after the Monster 1200 that premiered last November, Ducati
   announced a mid-sized Monster 821 as Bologna’s newest best in bikes.
   Ducati’s all time best seller, the third generation of the bike that
   ushered in the “naked” look finally gets its smaller displacement
   engine. The Monster 821 boasts an 11″ Terrastrota engine on a
   motorcycle that is impressively lightweight (396 lbs) considering its
   112 horsepower and 65.9 ft-lb of torque. Other bragging rights include
   eight-level traction control, three-level ABS and Ride-by-Wire — as
   well as press-button Riding Modes. Coming this July to Europe in either
   black on black or red and white.

   Designed from the wheels up to deliver maximum droptop enjoyment the
   all-new Ford Mustang convertible is a great way to escape the daily
   grind of life and hit the open road. With its distinct style and a
   completely redesigned top system, drivers can enjoy the shining sun or
   sparkling stars quicker with all of the performance and character
   expected of Mustang.

   Roush announced the details for the 2014 lineup including the RS, Stage
   1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 Mustang. While much remains the same for 2014,
   just like the factory lineup, Roush has brought a few updates to the
   table highlighted by an additional 10 horsepower for the Stage 3 (up to
   575 from 565) and a new Ford Racing Aluminator engine option for
   customers that might want to add even more horsepower to the
   supercharged 5.0-liter V8. Source/Read More
