  Research overview

   I've long been curious about the computational foundations of
   intelligence: How do our minds work? What computational principles and
   architectures underly thinking and intelligent behavior? I've pursued
   answers via studies of machine perception, learning, reasoning, and
   decision making. Many questions remain unanswered and much research is
   to be done. On the way to a deeper understanding, I work with
   colleagues to field working systems that can immediately deliver value
   in the world. Projects include efforts in time-critical decisions,
   information retrieval, healthcare, urban infrastructure,
   sustainability, and development--with goals of understanding how
   computational models perform amidst real-world complexities, and of
   deploying systems that deliver value to people and society. A key focus
   of my work has been on opportunities to leverage the complementarities
   of human and machine intelligence. Related interests include machine
   learning and decision making for crowdsourcing and human computation,
   information triage and alerting that takes human attention into
   consideration, spanning work on notification systems, surprise
   modeling, multitasking, and psychological studies of interruption and
   recovery. On the more theoretical front, I've been long interested in
   offline and real-time optimization of the expected value of
   computational systems under limited and varying resources. Areas of
   concentration in this realm include flexible or anytime computation,
   ideal metareasoning for guiding computation, compilation for reducing
   real-time deliberation, ongoing, continual computation, and the
   construction of bounded-optimal reasoning systems--systems that
   maximize the expected utility of their behavior in an environment,
   given the expected costs of reasoning, the problems encountered over
   time, and assertions about a system's constitution. Research in this
   arena includes tackling hard reasoning problems with learning and
   decision making methods.

   (AI2) and the Simons Institute, on the National Library of Medicine
   (NLM) Board of Regents, the Computer Science and Telecommunications
   Board (CSTB), and the External Advisory Board of the Center for Causal
   Discovery (CCD). In the realm of influences of AI on people and
   society, co-founder of the One Hundred Year Study on AI (AI100) and
   serve on the board of the Partnership on AI. Prior roles include
   service as president of the Association for the Advancement of
   Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), chair of the AAAS Section on
   Information, Computing, and Communication, and on the advisory board of
   NSF's Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE)
   Directorate, the Naval Research Advisory Committee (NRAC), and DARPA's
   Information Science & Technology (ISAT) Study Group.

   Elected fellow of the AAAI, ACM, AAAS, ACMI, American Academy of Arts
   and Sciences, American Philosophical Association, and National Academy
   of Engineering (NAE), and inducted into the CHI Academy.
