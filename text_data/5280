   our date night in with Mister and @RobertMondavi. On the menu: my
   personal Pissaladi√®re, a French pizza originating from Provence (I make
   mine with tapenade, caramelized onions and freshly-cut thyme from our
   San Francisco rooftop ‚Äúgarden") paired with the 2017 Napa Valley
   Chardonnay from #RobertMondaviWinery. It‚Äôs amazing what a little glass
   of Chardonnay and a simple homemade dish can do to reconnect with your
