EXPLORING AND DOCUMENTING DIVERSITY IN NATURE

   We ARE a taxonomic research network formed by institutions of reference
   in Europe. We HOLD 80% of the worlds’ described biodiversity as
   specimens, collections and their data. We CONNECT over 5000 researchers
   in European Natural History Museums, Natural Sciences Museums, Botanic
   Gardens and other research institutions. We CONTRIBUTE to Europe's
   knowledge-base by enhancing the synergies of our Member's collections
   and research capabilities.

Privacy Policy and Use of cookies

   When using this site personal data are collected and stored in
   databases, log files, or other systems. We adhere strictly to data
   protection regulations for storing and processing these data.

I.1 - Collected information from you on the CETAF website

I.1.1. Why and when we collect information from you

   We collect data and information from users in order to:
     * Provide a personalised experience and set of services to you. If
       you are staff of a CETAF Member Institution for instance, the
       website needs to know who you are in order to give you access to
       certain services or actions.
     * Monitor and improve our online contents and services.

   We collect information from you when:
     * You create a user account on the CETAF website.
     * You use your account to publish contents (when your profile allows
       you to do so).
       You browse the CETAF website – see cookies section below.
     * You subscribe to our online Newsletter and updates. Note that
       subscribing to the CETAF Newsletter and updates is separate from
       creating a user account.
     * You register online for the CETAF events and actions.

   We will disclose data to a third party only under explicitly stated
   circumstances (e.g. for purposes like conference registration, with
   specified partners in joint projects, or in cases where data are
   administered by an organization CETAF is a member of).

   We commit to not sharing information you provided with third parties
   without authorization, except for:
     * Anonymised data.
     * Data to state agencies only in compliance with legislation or in
       order to aid criminal proceedings should our systems be attacked.
       Data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer required.
     * Publicly visible data linked to your user account, as outlined
       below.

   External service providers who have been contracted by us to process
   data do not count as third parties as defined by data protection
   regulations; they are contractually obliged to adhere to data
   protection regulations and are subject to our supervision.

I.1.2. About your CETAF user account

   CETAF Members’ staff can create a personal user account for our
   website. Creating an user account is required for accessing certain
   documents and data, contributing to CETAF blogs and fora for Members
   and participating in certain actions on the CETAF website, for
   instance: Sharing documentation and publications of the different
   Community Working Groups, Initiatives and Projects. For staff of CETAF
   Member Institutions, accessing members-only services (Passports) and
   performing actions in the name of their organisation like publishing
   news and events in the “News” and “Forthcoming Events”, and prioritize
   them in the “Highlights” section.  The information you provide for your
   user account is not publicly visible. You can review and change it in
   the “User profile” tab of your account. We ask you to at least provide
   a title, first & last name, job title and institution. Only if you are
   the official CETAF Representative, several data are publicly visible in
   relation to the CETAF Member, ie.: complete name and email. That data
   appears below the name of the CETAF Member Institution you work for.

I.2 - Why and when we collect information from you individually

I.2.1. E-mail communication

   address info@cetaf.org. If you are in contact with a specific person,
   you may use the person’s own e-mail address on our domain (user:
   name.lastname)@cetaf.org. Your e-mail address will be used exclusively
   for the purpose of communicating with you and will not be shared with
   any third party, except in situations where this is absolutely
   necessary to comply with your request. We cannot yet provide encrypted
   email services. If you wish to contact us with confidential
   information, you are welcome to alternatively use the postal system

   The data we collect will be used exclusively for the purposes listed.
   In order for you to use certain parts of our services, we may need to
   store and use personal data in addition to the cases described here.
   In such cases we will obtain your prior consent.

   Note: to make sure that attendees to CETAF events receive important
   information, we may add the following email addresses to our general
   mailing list:
     * Emails of users who are speakers or convenors in sessions.
     * Emails of attendees who fill in the registration form, when
       requested.

 I.2.3. Registrations

   Some of our services require you to register. You will be required to
   provide relevant personal information, which will be used exclusively
   for the stated purpose. This may involve the explicit transfer of data
   though said information will be shared for such specified purposes
   only. Information you enter in web forms may be transmitted unencrypted
   via the Internet, in which case it may, in theory, be intercepted by
   unauthorized persons. Your registration is voluntary and can be deleted
   at any point.

I.2.4. The CETAF Newsletters and Circulars

   CETAF sends it Newsletters and Circulars only with explicit consent by
   the users. This requires the user to provide an e-mail address for
   certain purposes, such as the subscription to these circulars or
   newsletters. You may be required to confirm your e-mail address, for
   example by clicking on a link in a confirmation e-mail, to validate
   your registration. Any additional information you provide is voluntary
   and may help us to personalize our communications with you.
   Subscriptions to the newsletter will be stored to keep a record of the
   given consent. This includes the point in time of subscription and
   confirmation as well as the IP-address of the user. You may unsubscribe
   from circulars/newsletters at any point either via the unsubscribe
   button in our newsletter and circulars or via an e-mail to
   info@cetaf.org. When you unsubscribe, your information will be deleted
   from our system.

   Our newsletter is sent via the service provider “MailChimp” of Rocket
   Science Group, LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE #5000, Atlanta, GA 30308,
   USA. Their privacy policy can be found here:
   https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/. The Rocket Science Group has
   certified that it adheres to the Privacy-Shield Principles and
   guarantees therefore that European Data Protection law is followed. We
   are using this service provider based on our legitimate interests under
   GDPR Article 6 (1). The service provider can use pseudonymised data,
   i.e. without being able to connect this data to a user, for optimising
   their own services, e.g. to improve the technical support, or for
   statistical purposes. Our newsletters contain a web-beacon that
   collects technical information like IP-address and time of opening the
   newsletter but also data on your browser and operating system by the
   MailChimp servers. These information are used to improve our services
   following the technical data or by identifying audiences. This includes
   the statistical analysis of how our newsletter is received and used
   (e.g. has the recipient opened the newsletter? Which links were
   clicked?).These information can be allocated to single users. It serves
   exclusively the purpose of identifying reading habits of our audience
   to adjust our content to what interests our users most.

   In some cases (e.g., electronic journals, wikis, or blogs), information
   is collected in order to publish or permanently

   archive content generated or uploaded on our site. Where such content
   is subject to copyright, we are legally obliged to retain a minimal
   dataset (name and contact details, such as address or e-mail) even
   after account deletion in order to document authorship, licencing, or
   copyright issues and ensure that the moral rights of the author(s) are
   respected. If this information was not part of a publication and
   publicly visible, it will remain protected. It can, however, be
   referenced by the publisher of the platform (electronic journal, wiki,
   blog).

II. About cookies

II.1 - Cookies: what are they?

   A cookie is a small piece of data that a website asks your browser to
   store on your computer or mobile device. The cookie allows the website
   to "remember" your actions or preferences over time. We use cookies to
   enhance your browsing experience. They can be deleted after your visit
   on our site. You can block cookies in your browser settings. However,
   disabling cookies may prevent you from accessing the full content of
   our site.

II.2 - What cookies does the CETAF website use?

II.2.1. Functional cookies

   These cookies allow the website to remember preferences or choices you
   made. Their aim is to provide a comfortable browsing experience for
   you. They do not gather any information remembering where you've been
   on the Internet.

II.2.2. Analytics and third parties cookies

   We gather information about user demographics and behaviours on the
   website, in order to monitor the success of our different contents and
   services and improve them if necessary. We use analytics services
   developed and operated by another company, i.e. Google Analytics, a web
   analytics service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics
   uses cookies to help the website analyse how users use the site,
   compiling reports on website activities, and providing further services
   related to website and internet usage for the website operator. Google

   http://www.google.com/intl/de/analytics/privacyoverview.html.

II.2.3. Social plug-ins

   On some pages of our website, other organisations may also set their
   own anonymous cookies. They do this to track the success of their
   application, or to customise the application for you. Because of how
   cookies work, our website cannot access these cookies, nor can the
   other organisation access the data in cookies we use on our website.
   Our website uses social plug-ins for social networks such as Twitter,
   Facebook, YouTube or Flickr. These are often operated in countries
   outside the EU. More precise details about these services can be found
   on the providers’ own websites. Plug-ins are identified through the
   logo of the respective network or service. If you open a page of our
   website containing such a plug-in in your web browser, your web browser
   will create a direct connection to the servers of the respective
   provider in the country concerned. If you interact with a plug-in, e.g.
   if you click on the “Like” button or enter a comment in a form field,
   your browser will also transmit this information directly to the
   provider where it will be saved and, if applicable, continue to be used
   and published. You can find details on this, on your rights, and on
   ways in which you can prevent the collection and use of your data in
   order to protect your privacy in the data privacy policy of the
   respective provider. If you do not want a social network to collect
   data about you, you must log out of that network before visiting our
   website.

II.2.4. Google Maps

   We may embed maps of the platform “Google Maps” of the provider Google
   LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Data
   privacy statement: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/, Opt-Out:
   https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated.

II.2.5. Hyperlinks to other providers

   This Privacy Policy applies to all online services provided by CETAF.
   When we refer to or link to external content on third-party websites,
   CETAF can neither be held liable for the accuracy or completeness of
   such linked content, nor for the data security of such websites. Linked
   content is checked for obvious legal infringement at the time it is
   linked. Continual monitoring of the content of linked sites, however,
   is not feasible. We will, however, study any specific indications of
   legal infringement that is brought to our attention. Please notify us
   of any linked content that violates existing laws or is inappropriate
   in any other way. CETAF has no control over the extent to which
   external providers comply with data protection laws. Please check the
   privacy policy of any linked website you visit.

II.3 - How do I turn cookies off? Most Internet browsers allow you to change
your cookies settings. Here are the most common browsers’ help pages on
cookies:

     * Firefox
     * Explorer
     * Chrome
     * Safari

   Cetaf.org has Universal web tracking opt-out on: when the server
   receives the Do-Not-Track header from a client browser, the Google
   Analytics module will not embed any tracking code. This applies to
   logged in users and disabled page caching.

   Your personal information will be stored on secured computers.
   Authorization procedures regulate access to information, limiting
   access to the persons assigned to processing it. All personnel who

Privacy Policy and Use of cookies

   When using this site personal data are collected and stored in
   databases, log files, or other systems. We adhere strictly to data
   protection regulations for storing and processing these data.

I.1 - Collected information from you on the CETAF website

I.1.1. Why and when we collect information from you

   We collect data and information from users in order to:
     * Provide a personalised experience and set of services to you. If
       you are staff of a CETAF Member Institution for instance, the
       website needs to know who you are in order to give you access to
       certain services or actions.
     * Monitor and improve our online contents and services.

   We collect information from you when:
     * You create a user account on the CETAF website.
     * You use your account to publish contents (when your profile allows
       you to do so).
       You browse the CETAF website – see cookies section below.
     * You subscribe to our online Newsletter and updates. Note that
       subscribing to the CETAF Newsletter and updates is separate from
       creating a user account.
     * You register online for the CETAF events and actions.

   We will disclose data to a third party only under explicitly stated
   circumstances (e.g. for purposes like conference registration, with
   specified partners in joint projects, or in cases where data are
   administered by an organization CETAF is a member of).

   We commit to not sharing information you provided with third parties
   without authorization, except for:
     * Anonymised data.
     * Data to state agencies only in compliance with legislation or in
       order to aid criminal proceedings should our systems be attacked.
       Data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer required.
     * Publicly visible data linked to your user account, as outlined
       below.

   External service providers who have been contracted by us to process
   data do not count as third parties as defined by data protection
   regulations; they are contractually obliged to adhere to data
   protection regulations and are subject to our supervision.

I.1.2. About your CETAF user account

   CETAF Members’ staff can create a personal user account for our
   website. Creating an user account is required for accessing certain
   documents and data, contributing to CETAF blogs and fora for Members
   and participating in certain actions on the CETAF website, for
   instance: Sharing documentation and publications of the different
   Community Working Groups, Initiatives and Projects. For staff of CETAF
   Member Institutions, accessing members-only services (Passports) and
   performing actions in the name of their organisation like publishing
   news and events in the “News” and “Forthcoming Events”, and prioritize
   them in the “Highlights” section.  The information you provide for your
   user account is not publicly visible. You can review and change it in
   the “User profile” tab of your account. We ask you to at least provide
   a title, first & last name, job title and institution. Only if you are
   the official CETAF Representative, several data are publicly visible in
   relation to the CETAF Member, ie.: complete name and email. That data
   appears below the name of the CETAF Member Institution you work for.

I.2 - Why and when we collect information from you individually

I.2.1. E-mail communication

   If you want to communicate with us by e-mail please use our main
   address info@cetaf.org. If you are in contact with a specific person,
   you may use the person’s own e-mail address on our domain (user:
   name.lastname)@cetaf.org. Your e-mail address will be used exclusively
   for the purpose of communicating with you and will not be shared with
   any third party, except in situations where this is absolutely
   necessary to comply with your request. We cannot yet provide encrypted
   email services. If you wish to contact us with confidential
   information, you are welcome to alternatively use the postal system

I.2.2. The CETAF Mailing Lists (@list.cetaf.org)

   We collect data and information from interested people in order to:
     * Share updated information on any CETAF related topic or action.
     * Coordinate and collaborate within a CETAF Body.
     * Encourage participation in CETAF initiatives.
     * Request collaboration and feedback from CETAF Members’ staff.
     * Promote a collaborative action among the Membership.
     * Disseminate our achievements.
     * Raise awareness of our community projects and joint position.
     * Monitor and improve our activity.

   We collect information from you when:
     * You are part the Official representative(s) of a CETAF Member
       Institution.
     * You are staff of a CETAF Member and collaborate in any of the CETAF
       Bodies.
     * You participate in any CETAF event or action.
     * You collaborate with CETAF in any of its initiatives.
     * You express your willingness to be informed on CETAF.

   The data we collect will be used exclusively for the purposes listed.
   In order for you to use certain parts of our services, we may need to
   store and use personal data in addition to the cases described here.
   In such cases we will obtain your prior consent.

   Note: to make sure that attendees to CETAF events receive important
   information, we may add the following email addresses to our general
   mailing list:
     * Emails of users who are speakers or convenors in sessions.
     * Emails of attendees who fill in the registration form, when
       requested.

 I.2.3. Registrations

   Some of our services require you to register. You will be required to
   provide relevant personal information, which will be used exclusively
   for the stated purpose. This may involve the explicit transfer of data
   though said information will be shared for such specified purposes
   only. Information you enter in web forms may be transmitted unencrypted
   via the Internet, in which case it may, in theory, be intercepted by
   unauthorized persons. Your registration is voluntary and can be deleted
   at any point.

I.2.4. The CETAF Newsletters and Circulars

   CETAF sends it Newsletters and Circulars only with explicit consent by
   the users. This requires the user to provide an e-mail address for
   certain purposes, such as the subscription to these circulars or
   newsletters. You may be required to confirm your e-mail address, for
   example by clicking on a link in a confirmation e-mail, to validate
   your registration. Any additional information you provide is voluntary
   and may help us to personalize our communications with you.
   Subscriptions to the newsletter will be stored to keep a record of the
   given consent. This includes the point in time of subscription and
   confirmation as well as the IP-address of the user. You may unsubscribe
   from circulars/newsletters at any point either via the unsubscribe
   button in our newsletter and circulars or via an e-mail to
   info@cetaf.org. When you unsubscribe, your information will be deleted
   from our system.

   Our newsletter is sent via the service provider “MailChimp” of Rocket
   Science Group, LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE #5000, Atlanta, GA 30308,
   USA. Their privacy policy can be found here:
   https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/. The Rocket Science Group has
   certified that it adheres to the Privacy-Shield Principles and
   guarantees therefore that European Data Protection law is followed. We
   are using this service provider based on our legitimate interests under
   GDPR Article 6 (1). The service provider can use pseudonymised data,
   i.e. without being able to connect this data to a user, for optimising
   their own services, e.g. to improve the technical support, or for
   statistical purposes. Our newsletters contain a web-beacon that
   collects technical information like IP-address and time of opening the
   newsletter but also data on your browser and operating system by the
   MailChimp servers. These information are used to improve our services
   following the technical data or by identifying audiences. This includes
   the statistical analysis of how our newsletter is received and used
   (e.g. has the recipient opened the newsletter? Which links were
   clicked?).These information can be allocated to single users. It serves
   exclusively the purpose of identifying reading habits of our audience
   to adjust our content to what interests our users most.

   In some cases (e.g., electronic journals, wikis, or blogs), information
   is collected in order to publish or permanently

   archive content generated or uploaded on our site. Where such content
   is subject to copyright, we are legally obliged to retain a minimal
   dataset (name and contact details, such as address or e-mail) even
   after account deletion in order to document authorship, licencing, or
   copyright issues and ensure that the moral rights of the author(s) are
   respected. If this information was not part of a publication and
   publicly visible, it will remain protected. It can, however, be
   referenced by the publisher of the platform (electronic journal, wiki,
   blog).

II. About cookies

II.1 - Cookies: what are they?

   A cookie is a small piece of data that a website asks your browser to
   store on your computer or mobile device. The cookie allows the website
   to "remember" your actions or preferences over time. We use cookies to
   enhance your browsing experience. They can be deleted after your visit
   on our site. You can block cookies in your browser settings. However,
   disabling cookies may prevent you from accessing the full content of
   our site.

II.2 - What cookies does the CETAF website use?

II.2.1. Functional cookies

   These cookies allow the website to remember preferences or choices you
   made. Their aim is to provide a comfortable browsing experience for
   you. They do not gather any information remembering where you've been
   on the Internet.

II.2.2. Analytics and third parties cookies

   We gather information about user demographics and behaviours on the
   website, in order to monitor the success of our different contents and
   services and improve them if necessary. We use analytics services
   developed and operated by another company, i.e. Google Analytics, a web
   analytics service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics
   uses cookies to help the website analyse how users use the site,
   compiling reports on website activities, and providing further services
   related to website and internet usage for the website operator. Google
   has certified that it adheres to the Privacy-Shield Principles and
   garantuees therefore that European Data Protection law is followed.
   Further information on the terms of use and privacy policy of Google
   Analytics can be found on:
   http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html and
   http://www.google.com/intl/de/analytics/privacyoverview.html.

II.2.3. Social plug-ins

   On some pages of our website, other organisations may also set their
   own anonymous cookies. They do this to track the success of their
   application, or to customise the application for you. Because of how
   cookies work, our website cannot access these cookies, nor can the
   other organisation access the data in cookies we use on our website.
   Our website uses social plug-ins for social networks such as Twitter,
   Facebook, YouTube or Flickr. These are often operated in countries
   outside the EU. More precise details about these services can be found
   on the providers’ own websites. Plug-ins are identified through the
   logo of the respective network or service. If you open a page of our
   website containing such a plug-in in your web browser, your web browser
   will create a direct connection to the servers of the respective
   provider in the country concerned. If you interact with a plug-in, e.g.
   if you click on the “Like” button or enter a comment in a form field,
   your browser will also transmit this information directly to the
   provider where it will be saved and, if applicable, continue to be used
   and published. You can find details on this, on your rights, and on
   ways in which you can prevent the collection and use of your data in
   order to protect your privacy in the data privacy policy of the
   respective provider. If you do not want a social network to collect
   data about you, you must log out of that network before visiting our
   website.

II.2.4. Google Maps

   We may embed maps of the platform “Google Maps” of the provider Google
   LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Data
   privacy statement: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/, Opt-Out:
   https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated.

II.2.5. Hyperlinks to other providers

   This Privacy Policy applies to all online services provided by CETAF.
   When we refer to or link to external content on third-party websites,
   CETAF can neither be held liable for the accuracy or completeness of
   such linked content, nor for the data security of such websites. Linked
   content is checked for obvious legal infringement at the time it is
   linked. Continual monitoring of the content of linked sites, however,
   is not feasible. We will, however, study any specific indications of
   legal infringement that is brought to our attention. Please notify us
   of any linked content that violates existing laws or is inappropriate
   in any other way. CETAF has no control over the extent to which
   external providers comply with data protection laws. Please check the
   privacy policy of any linked website you visit.

II.3 - How do I turn cookies off? Most Internet browsers allow you to change
your cookies settings. Here are the most common browsers’ help pages on
cookies:

     * Firefox
     * Explorer
     * Chrome
     * Safari

   Cetaf.org has Universal web tracking opt-out on: when the server
   receives the Do-Not-Track header from a client browser, the Google
   Analytics module will not embed any tracking code. This applies to
   logged in users and disabled page caching.

III: DATA PROTECTION

III.1 - Data security

   Your personal information will be stored on secured computers.
   Authorization procedures regulate access to information, limiting
   access to the persons assigned to processing it. All personnel who
   collect, process, or use personal data are bound to data
   confidentiality.

III.2 - Right to information and contact data

   You have the right to receive disclosure about data stored about you on
   request. Furthermore, you may request the correction of erroneous data
   and the deletion of data that is no longer needed. Should you wish to
   make an application to view, correct, or delete your data, or if you
   have any other questions about this PRIVACY POLICY, please email
   info@cetaf.org.

IV. VALIDITY AND CHANGES

   valid. Technological developments and changing legal requirements may
   necessitate changes to it at any time. Please check this Privacy Policy
