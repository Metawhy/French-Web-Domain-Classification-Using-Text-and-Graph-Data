The Low Down

   The search input type is used to designate the input as being used for
   search.
     * Support is a bit arbitrary here as the spec doesn’t require any
       special treatment for search fields. Android doesn’t do anything
       special though, where all other browsers do.
     * The results and autosave attributes shown above are not standard.
       In WebKit and Blink browsers you can add the
       non-standard resultsattribute to get a looking glass icon to click
       to see the latest searches, and autosave to keep them across page
       loads.
     * Safari, Opera and Chrome (on OS X) round the corners of search
       inputs. These same browsers on Windows do not round the corners of
       the inputs. Presumably the OS X rounding is to match the look of
       search inputs in the operating system (Finder windows). Firefox and
       IE do not round corners.
     * When a value is present, a gray x control shows up on the right of
       the input in IE, Chrome, Safari and Opera (but not Firefox or
       Chrome on Android) which can be clicked to clear the value. IE
       includes this x in non-search controls as well.
     * WebKit’s special styling prevents some CSS attributes from
       functioning as expected: padding, font stuff (only three allowable
       font-sizes), border, background… You can remove special styling and
       limitations and return the look back to a regular text input with:
-webkit-appearance: none;

     * Falls back to a regular text input.
     * More info here, including font-size limitations.
     * Use case: combine with datalist to help users with common search
       terms.
     * In Chrome 17 (or possibly before, but not as early as 13), you get
       a dropdown menu of past searches when the field comes into focus.

The Low Down

   The formaction attribute forces a form to direct to the specified URL
   instead of the URL specified as the value of the action attribute in
   the <form> element.
     * Valid for submitting elements,
       including <input type=submit> and <input type=image> and <button>.
     * Used to override the default form action. Possible use case: “Send
       to Marketing” / “Send to Support”
     * Not sure exactly when support in Safari began: it didn’t work in
       Safari 5.0.3 but does now in 5.2. Also fixed from iOS 4 to 5.

The Low Down

   The formenctype attribute can force a form to submit the data in the
   specified encoding rather than the encoding specified in the form
   element when submitted as “post”.
     * Valid as an attribute of elements that can submit a form,
       including <inputtype=submit> and <input type=image> and <button>.
     * Possible values include
          + the default of “application/x-www-form-urlencoded” which
            encodes special chars in the URL to ASCII HEX values and
            spaces to ‘+’,
          + no encoding with multipart/form-data, and
          + text/plain which only converts spaces to +, and leaves other
            characters as is.
     * Setting a value other than typical encoding types
       yields inconsistent results.
